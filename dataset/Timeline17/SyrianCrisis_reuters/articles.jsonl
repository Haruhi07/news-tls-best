'' \nRemuneration is by far the biggest cost center , well ahead of premises and technology , said Alexandre Zeller , head of Private banking , EMEA at HSBC , adding that banks have to put time and effort into finding the right people to serve its clients . \n`` The value of staff in our business is actually extremely high , '' said de Weck . \n`` When we make a new hire it takes 2.5 to three years for them to become productive . \nBut the penalty for making the wrong pay decision in our business is very high . '' \nBankers at the Reuters summit generally confirmed their commitment to their businesses in Switzerland , although they said the strong Swiss franc was limiting profitability . \nAs competition limits growth in developed markets , the fight for staff was intensifying in higher-growth areas like Singapore . \nDe Weck said these factors have pushed the cost of Asian bankers higher than in Switzerland , while in London staff costs are about the same . \nThe business remains centered around people and relationships and downward pressure on costs can have only a limited effect on pay scales , said Pablo Garnica , European head of JP Morgan 's private bank . \n`` You need to reward people to incentivize people to grow , '' Garnica said . \n`` At the end of the day you need to have the people capable of dealing with clients and complex situations . \nAt the end of the day you need a human being talking to a human being .

{"id": "120", "time": "2011-03-17", "text": "WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 17 , 2011 11:21 pm GMT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. Security Council voted on Thursday to authorise a no-fly zone over Libya and `` all necessary measures '' -- code for military action -- to protect civilians from Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . \nHere are some questions and answers on the no-fly zone . \nWHEN WOULD ANY OPERATION START ? \nDiplomatic sources in France , which favors more aggressive action against Gaddafi , say military action could come as soon as Friday and could include France , Britain , possibly the United States and one or more Arab states . \nBut a U.S. military official said no immediate U.S. action was expected following the vote . \nIt is unclear exactly how long it would take to arrange the military operations needed to enforce the no-fly zone . \nLast week , the head of U.S. Joint Forces Command said the Pentagon could implement a no-fly zone ` within a couple of days . ' \nBut on Thursday , U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz said it would take `` upwards of a week . '' \nWHAT FORCES WOULD BE INVOLVED ? \nGulf or Arab League countries have warships and fighter aircraft , but have shown little capability to deploy those forces outside their region and Gulf countries are distracted by the crisis in Bahrain . \nSchwartz , speaking to the U.S. Senate on Thursday , said there were `` nations within the Arab League with capable air forces that under the right circumstances might be brought to bear . '' \nDiplomats have said that among Arab League members , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar may be prepared to take part in enforcing a no-fly zone . \nIf the United States chose not to get involved , Britain and France probably have the military capabilities to mount a limited no-fly zone or maritime exclusion zone . \nNATO nations , whatever the arrangement , might ask for the use of air bases in Italy . \nAn Italian government source told Reuters on Thursday that Italy was ready to make its military bases available to enforce a no-fly zone . \nBut U.S. officials believe the Pentagon , with its extensive air and sea assets , would do the heavy lifting . \nWHAT EQUIPMENT MIGHT THE PENTAGON USE ? \nThe United States , if it decides to enforce a no-fly zone , would likely be required to pull air assets from Europe and the United States , officials say , and possibly even from Iraq and Afghanistan . \nSome commanders fear that could tax a military already stretched by two wars and , now , aid efforts in Japan . \n`` There are limited intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance assets , '' Schwartz said . \nThe United States would likely use bombers and fighter planes , possibly including F-16s , F-15s and F-22s , to strike ground targets , Schwartz said . \nIt would also deploy surveillance planes , aerial refuelling planes , satellite communication equipment and aircraft capable of jamming Libyan communications . \nWOULD IT BE EFFECTIVE IN STOPPING GADDAFI ? \nAs time passes , fewer people believe a no-fly zone would be decisive on the ground . \nGovernment forces have relied mainly on artillery barrages followed by advances by tanks and other ground forces to drive back rebels , and NATO warplanes flying over Libya might be unable to protect civilians on the ground . \nIn a sign of reservations within the U.S. military , Schwartz said a no-fly zone alone would not be sufficient to reverse the momentum of Gaddafi 's troops . \nIt would be a major challenge to enforce a no-fly zone over all of Libya , with a land area some 35 times that of Bosnia , where NATO implemented a no-fly zone in the early 1990s . \nOfficials might choose to set up a more limited area around the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi , using a smaller number of combat and support aircraft . \nWHAT EQUIPMENT DOES GADDAFI HAVE ? \nLast week , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Gaddafi had about 80 operational aircraft -- a mix of helicopters , transport aircraft and fighter jets . \nSchwartz said there were `` multiple tens of combat aircraft '' and helicopters numbering in the `` low hundreds '' that had been flying `` tens '' of sorties a day . \nBut Libyan aircraft , which Clapper said relied on visual rather than computer targeting , is far less sophisticated than the planes and helicopters flown by U.S. counterparts . \nThe International Institute for Strategic Studies , a London-based think tank , estimates Gaddafi has as few as 40 fixed-wing aircraft and the bulk of his air force 's equipment is obsolescent in Western terms . \nWOULD THE FOREIGN FORCE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT AIR DEFENSES ? \nThere is some disagreement about this . \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates says it would be necessary before U.S. aircraft could mount patrols over Libya . \nOpponents of the no-fly zone say that would be an act of war . \nOthers believe pre-emptive strikes against Libya 's outdated Soviet surface-to-air missiles would not be needed and NATO warplanes could wait until Libyan radar `` locked on '' to them . \nClapper said Libya had the second largest air defense system in the Middle East , with about 31 surface-to-air missile sites and a large number of portable surface-to-air missiles . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "118", "time": "2011-03-17", "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a dictator who wants to be accepted by polite Western society should look for a charming , glamorous wife . \nThat , at least , is what the world s autocrats are learning from the example of Bashar al-Assad , the president of Syria . \nFirst , his wife , Asma al-Assad , was the subject of a glowing profile in the March issue of the U.S. edition of Vogue , which described this rose in the desert as the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies and reported on the wildly democratic principles that govern family life chez Assad . \nNow , the Harvard Arab Alumni Association has organized an event in Damascus , under the patronage of Mrs. Assad , who was scheduled to deliver a keynote address on Thursday . \nOn Wednesday , the day before the planned Harvard alumni event , security officers beat and detained a group of nonviolent demonstrators who gathered to call for the release of the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 political prisoners in the country . \nOn its Web site earlier this week , the Harvard Arab Alumni Association highlighted its connection with the dictator s wife : We are greatly honored to hold our Arab World Conference under the esteemed patronage of Her Excellency Mrs. Asma al-Assad , The First Lady of Syria , and are privileged that Her Excellency will deliver the conference s keynote address . \nA thought-provoking , inspiring and tireless leader and advocate , the First Lady s address will certainly be the highlight of our event . \nThe Web site was enthusiastic about Mrs. Assad s role in Syrian national life and the connection between her work and that of her husband s regime : In her role as Syria s first lady , Her Excellency Asma al-Assad applies her experience , energy and influence to her country s social and cultural development . \nHer role reflects the significant economic , political and social change that is happening in Syria today . \nAsma al-Assad s work supports that of President Bashar al-Assad by fostering the emergence of a robust , independent and self-sustaining civil society . \nAccording to a Human Rights Watch report released in January , the Syrian authorities were among the worst violators of human rights in the world in 2010 , torturing their opponents , imprisoning lawyers and violently repressing ethnic Kurds . \nHuman Rights Watch said it had credible reports that security agencies arbitrarily detained dissidents and criminal suspects , held them incommunicado . \nIt also said that those detained were subjected to ill - treatment and torture . \nNadim Houry , the senior researcher on Syria and Lebanon for Human Rights Watch , said the prominent role for Mrs. Assad was part of a general charm offensive . \nHe took particular issue with the Harvard Arab Alumni Association Web site s reference to the first family s support for independent civil society . \nThis is definitely crossing the line , he said . \nThere is nothing independent and nothing self-sustaining about what the government is doing with civil society in Syria . \nRichard N. Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations , said he was surprised that Syria which effectively occupied Lebanon for almost 30 years , allied itself with Iran and aided groups like Hamas had faced less scrutiny than other local dictatorships . \nIt is ironic that it has escaped , for the most part , criticism , Dr. Haass said . \nThe Harvard Arab Alumni Association s Web site includes a disclaimer describing itself as an independent , not-for-profit organization and stating : Nothing that is published by the HAAA should be taken to represent the opinions or endorsement of Harvard University , the President and Fellows of Harvard College , or the Harvard Alumni Association . \nAccording to the program , six people with Harvard affiliations were scheduled to speak at or moderate sessions at the daylong event , including the Harvard Guest Address , one of three keynote speeches , to be delivered by Jorge Dominguez , Harvard s vice provost for international affairs . \nIn an e-mail , John Longbrake , a Harvard spokesman , said that the Harvard Arab Alumni Association was an independent organization but that we are supportive of any alumni group that hosts a conference encouraging open dialogue and the exploration of ideas . \nIn his talk , Professor Dominguez will be highlighting Harvard s engagement in the Arab world and discussing the value of freedom of inquiry and why liberty of the mind builds a democratic society , Mr. Longbrake wrote . \nThe positive references to the Syrian government in a conference with Harvard involvement provoked intense debate among U.S. political scientists this week , with one e-mailing a colleague to say it was shocking and disgusting . \nBut others said the event highlighted how hard it was to strike precisely the right balance between engaging authoritarian regimes and appearing to legitimize them . \nTo me , the real challenge is to navigate simultaneously working with governments and civil society , said Anne - Marie Slaughter , a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University . \nUPDATE : I had e-mailed Harvard Professor Jorge Dominguez on Wednesday asking for his thoughts on the Harvard Arab Alumni Association event , but my deadline passed before we had an opportunity to connect . \nSubsequently Professor Dominguez sent me the following e-mail outlining the subject of his keynote speech . \nWhat follows is not a response to my column since he has not yet had a chance to read it , but rather a bit of supplementary information . \n`` I spoke this morning on several themes . \nOne is Harvard s long engagement with the Arab world , which started with the teaching of the Arabic language sporadically since the late 17th century and regularly since an endowment for that purpose was established 75 years ago . \nSimilarly , Harvard s library resources in Arabic are approximately 270,000 volumes , which makes it the largest research university library collection in Arabic materials in the world . \nMoving closer to the present , I noted that we ve increased the number of students from the Arab world from 47 to 96 over the past decade , and discussed how the University s admissions and financial aid policies span the world . \nHarvard is the best university in the world for a poor person . \n`` I went on to discuss the meaning of education . \nSome examples are case-based student-focused learning of the type evident in case discussions in our professional schools -LRB- business , law , public policy -RRB- . \nThere is no right or wrong answer to such discussions but , rather , a vigorous analysis of varying approaches . \n`` Then , I illustrated my own understanding of a liberal education in terms of a course I teach , in which in each lecture I present an argument and deliver it as persuasively as I can , only to have it contradicted in subsequent lectures where the lecture is also delivered as persuasively as I can . \nI noted that in exams and papers I never ask for the right answer because each student must be able to formulate two answers . \nI described how competition between ideas and interpretation is a key to free inquiry in any society , and how the liberty of the mind , open to the world , is both the most effective way to learn about citizenship as well as professional life , and to construct a democratic society . \nFinally , I turned to research in various endeavors that Harvard faculty and students carry out in various parts of the Arab world . \n`` I closed by praising the Harvard Arab Alumni Association for bringing the discussion to a city in the Arab world , to build on the value of freedom of inquiry and competition between ideas and interpretations through the manner in which they built the conference program . \nThere were several panelists per panel and a vigorous moderator who kept the dynamics going and prevented ossified speeches . \nEach session had a good chunk of time for many questions and comments where , of course , the recent developments across the Arab world were raised and addressed . \nThe HAAA deserved praise , therefore , for bringing vigorous debate to a discussion in an Arab city about problems in the Arab world , presumably a value many of your readers may share as well . '' \nThe only thing being discussed is that there was an assassination and Syria was involved in it . \nHow come Syria is in Lebanon in the first place ? \nWhy did the US welcome Syria in Lebanon in 1976 ? \nWhy did George Bush I support Syrian presence and domination and influence in Lebanon in 1991 as part of his campaign against Iraq ? \nWhy did the US support the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 ? \nWhy did the US support Israel s 22 year occupation of parts of Lebanon , an occupation in violation of Security Council resolutions ? \nAll these topics , and many others , are missing from the discussion . \nIn fact , the general principle is that anything that places US actions in a questionable light is omitted , with very rare exceptions . \nSo if you blame something on an enemy , then you can discuss it , and Syria , right now is the official enemy . \nThat doesn t necessarily mean that the charges against Syria are wrong . \nIt just means that everything else is omitted . \nThe problem for the US is that Syria is not a subordinate state . \nThere are a lot of serious criticisms you can make about Syria , but the internal problems of that country are of no special concern to the US , which supports much more brutal governments . \nThe problem with Syria is that it simply does not subordinate itself to the US program in the Middle East . \nSyria and Iran are the two countries in the region that have not accepted US economic arrangements . \nThank you for saying what needed to be said Noam . \nI am guessing there were many other comments similar to yours that were removed by moderators because their names did n't have marquis billing . \nWatching recent events throughout the Arab world and it is plain to see that U.S. puppets are largely excluded from any meaningful regime changes while the US and it 's corporate allies encourage the ones that displace socialist revolutionary regimes like Libya 's . \nSyria and Venezuela will be next , while Egypt 's ongoing dictatorship will be allowed to remain , along with Bahrain , Yemen , Jordan and every other pliable client state . \nNewscorp and Reuters need to stop playing along with corporate spin and read a few good books by yourself and William Blum to get some perspective . \nWell , the real problem with Syria is that does n't even come close to observing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \nBeing that it is truly `` Universal '' , it is not biased towards the US economic arrangements or any other US issue . \nStates do n't have to be `` subordinate '' to the US to follow the UDHR . \nThey do n't have to agree with the US on military or economic policy . \nActually the opposite is the case , when countries move to observing the UDHR they tend to be in less conflict with their neighbors , less antagonistic towards the `` western world '' . \nIt is not a surprise that when Venezuela moved from generally observing the UDHR to a gross violator of the UDHR they also became antagonistic of the US . \nWhen they get democracy back & resume observing the UDHR they will likely be more friendly with the US . \nThat does n't mean they will be subservient to the US . \nBTW , which governments that are `` more brutal '' than the Baath regime does the US support . \nI realize under Obama 's `` reach out to genocidal maniacs '' policy , he was trying to cuddle up to Syria but now Sadam has gone it is hard to see a worse regime in the Middle East . \nAt least Hizbollah builds hospitals . \nFirstly , I greatly envy those who had Professor Dominguez for a college professor . \nI hope his students realize their good fortune . \nSecondly , as demonstrated by Iraq and Afghanistan , the expenditures of military might , vast sums of wealth and diplomatic energies result in only a modest effect on entrenched social and political forces . \nSelectively promoting changes in political leadership in a few countries that are ripe for the process will likely promote a gradual positive change in the regimes that remain ; America 's current endeavors are likely to eventually yield better results than war at a much lower cost . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPrior , she was U.S. managing editor of the Financial Times . \nBefore that , Freeland was deputy editor , Financial Times , in London , editor of the FT s Weekend edition , editor of FT.com , U.K. News editor , Moscow bureau chief and Eastern Europe correspondent . \nFrom 1999 to 2001 , Freeland served for two years as deputy editor of The Globe and Mail , Canada s national newspaper . \nFreeland began her career working as a stringer in Ukraine , writing for the FT , The Washington Post and The Economist . \nANY OPINIONS EXPRESSED HERE ARE THE AUTHOR S OWN . \n"}

'' \nAden had been relatively quiet in recent months , even as protests in other parts of the country erupted into sporadic violence . \nThe neighbouring Abyan province has witnessed daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the city of Jaar in March and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in May . \nThe army , which says the militants are part of al Qaeda 's Yemen-based wing , launched an offensive to retake Zinjibar five days ago but has yet to regain the city . \nThe army impose a security belt around Aden several weeks ago to try to prevent more militants from slipping into the strategic port city . \nIt had previously reported that several al Qaeda linked operatives had snuck into Aden , where some 54,000 Abyan residents have sought refuge . \nFurther north in the capital Sanaa , opposition officials said the head of the leading Islamist party Islah survived an attack by gunmen . \nSanaa has been the scene of rising violence in recent days following weeks of relative calm after Saleh traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment on wounds he suffered in a bomb blast at his compound . \nYemen 's opposition coalition said the gunmen fired on Islah leader Mohammed al-Yadumi 's car but he escaped the attack . \nThe group blamed Saleh 's family and forces loyal to him , and warned the move could spark worse violence in the fragmented nation . \n`` Targeting the head of Islah is an attempt to plunge the country into civil war . \nSaleh 's family is deluded in thinking it can remain in power , '' the coalition said in a statement . \n-LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa , Humeyra Pamuk in Dubai and Stephen Mangan in London ; Writing by Erika Solomon ; Editing by Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "337", "time": "2011-07-20", "text": "News Corp Chief Executive and Chairman , Rupert Murdoch appears before a parliamentary committee on phone hacking at Portcullis House in London July 19 , 2011 . \nCredit : Reuters\\/Parbul TV via Reuters Tv NEW YORK | Wed Jul 20 , 2011 12:19 am BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Rupert Murdoch sat through the first hour of questioning by British lawmakers probing News Corp 's phone-hacking scandal , it looked like days of work by his team of crisis management advisers would go up in smoke . \nThey crafted an opening statement for the media mogul that included a killer sound bite -- `` This is the most humble day of my life '' -- only to have the parliamentary committee deny him the chance to deliver it . \nThat appeared to shake the 80-year-old Murdoch , who sounded exasperated and looked uncomfortable in the early going on Tuesday , dodging questions and banging his hands on the table he shared with his son James . \n`` That first hour was a real bummer , '' said one source close to News Corp. `` He looked overprepared by the lawyers . \nIn time , he stepped up into being himself . \nHe pushed back a bit , talked about his ethics . '' \nMurdoch 's performance , far from perfect , still probably came as a relief to his public relations advisers , who were charged with finding a strategy to contain a telephone-hacking scandal that has turned into full-blown crisis for News Corp. . \nThe team , which assembled in London late last week , included outside advisers Alex Bigg and James Lundie from Edelman , the world 's biggest PR firm , and Steven Rubenstein from Rubenstein Public Relations , a fixture in New York communications with a long history with the Murdochs . \nThe in-house team was led by Joel Klein , who once headed the U.S. Justice Department 's antitrust unit -LRB- ID : nN1E76E1OR -RRB- , and Matthew Anderson , who runs News Corp 's strategic affairs . \nFrom that group of advisers came the suggestion late last week that Murdoch sit down with and apologise to the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler , whose phone was hacked by his now-shuttered Sunday tabloid , News of the World . \nMurdoch also prepared a broader apology to readers that ran in all national British newspapers over the weekend , and then moved to quiet critics by accepting the resignation of trusted employees News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks and Dow Jones & Co CEO Les Hinton . \nEven within the circle of close advisers , however , few believe Murdoch has found the silver bullet to end the crisis . \n`` This is burning white hot , '' said the source . \n`` You 've got to let it burn for a while . '' \nIn a sign that News Corp is concerned the crisis could spread to the United States , it hired Sard Verbinnen , based in New York , and The Glover Park Group , based in Washington D.C. , to assist in public and government relations . \nRubenstein will also play a key role in the United States . \nThe son of legendary communications veteran Howard Rubenstein has represented Murdoch 's New York Post as well as entertainment figures such as David Letterman , who hired him to deal with a scandal over a series of affairs with work colleagues . \n`` Recovery from a crisis of this magnitude is slow , '' said Chris Tennyson , co-leader of crisis communications practice at Fleishman-Hillard , which is not involved in the matter . \n`` Anyone who had bone to pick with Rupert Murdoch is now in the water . \nIt will open a period of intensity -- it will be fierce and furious . '' \nStill , experts say Murdoch appears on better footing after misjudging the depth of public anger over allegations that News of the World journalists hacked into the voicemails of thousands of people , from crime victims to families of soldiers killed in combat . \nAmong the team of PR aces , a lot of credit is being given to Klein , a former New York City schools chancellor who has been tapped to lead a new management and standards committee at News Corp. . \nAnderson , too , is getting high marks . \nA former junior tennis champion , he has been close friends with James Murdoch since they both worked in Asia -- Anderson for the PR firm Ogilvy and Murdoch for BSkyB . \nMurdoch later hired Anderson , a native of San Francisco , to run communications for BSkyB before bringing him onboard News Corp. . \nJames Murdoch is viewed as having carried himself well during the proceeding , outperforming his father and relieving some of the pressure over his future . \nThe senior Murdoch gained momentum in the second hour of the hearing -- he did manage to slip in the `` humble '' quote early on -- offering more forceful answers on his responsibility and the role of his papers in British society . \nAn unexpected attack by a protester wielding a plate of white foam , who was fought off by Murdoch 's wife , Wendi , only served to help his case , PR experts said . \nIt became the leading headline and humanized the billionaire media baron . \n`` The combination of Rupert Murdoch 's age and the custard pie attack will have elicited a tremendous amount of sympathy , '' said Andrew Hawkins , chairman of Comres , a polling company . \n`` You could n't make this stuff up . \nIt could have turned the whole situation around for them .

'' \nSyrian rights activist Ammar Qurabi told Reuters in Cairo : `` There have been at least two killed -LRB- in Latakia -RRB- today after security forces opened fire on protesters trying to torch the Baath party building . '' \n`` I have been in touch with people in Syria since last night , using three cell phones and constantly sitting online . \nEvents are moving at an extremely fast pace . '' \nExiled dissident Maamoun al-Homsi told Reuters by telephone from Canada : `` I have the name of four martyrs who have fallen in Latakia yesterday . '' \nThe state news agency quoted a government source as saying security forces had not fired at protesters but that an armed group had taken over rooftops and fired on citizens and security forces , killing five people since Friday . \nIn Damascus and other cities , thousands of Assad 's supporters marched or and drove around , waving flags , to proclaim their allegiance to the Baath party . \nThe unrest in Syria came to a head after police detained more than a dozen schoolchildren for scrawling graffiti inspired by pro-democracy protests across the Arab world . \nPresident Assad made a public pledge on Thursday to look into granting greater freedom and lifting emergency laws dating back to 1963 , but failed to dampen the protests . \nOn Saturday a human rights lawyer said 260 prisoners , mostly Islamists , had been freed after serving at least three-quarters of their sentences . \nAmnesty International put the death toll in and around Deraa in the past week at 55 at least . \nIn Sanamein , near Deraa , 20 protesters were shot dead on Friday , a resident told Al Jazeera . \nOne unidentified doctor told CNN television that snipers had been shooting people in Deraa from atop government buildings . \n`` We had 30 people got shot in the head and the neck and we had hundreds of people got wounded , '' he said . \n`` We put two wounded in an ambulance sending them to the hospital . \nWe had security forces stop the ambulances , get the wounded outside the ambulance and shoot them , and said : ` Now you can take them to the hospital ' . '' \nSome of the dead protesters were buried on Saturday in Deraa and nearby villages , residents said . \nSeveral thousand mourners prayed over the body of 13-year-old Seeta al-Akrad in Deraa 's Omari mosque , scene of an attack by security forces earlier in the week . \nPolice were not in evidence when they marched to a cemetery chanting : `` The people want the downfall of the regime , '' a refrain heard in uprisings from Tunisia to Egypt and Yemen . \nEmboldened by the lack of security presence , the mourners also chanted : `` Strike , strike , until the regime falls ! '' \nAbu Jassem , a Deraa resident , said : `` We were under a lot of pressure from the oppressive authority , but now when you pass by -LRB- the security forces -RRB- , nobody utters a word . \nThey do n't dare talk to the people . \nThe people have no fear any more . '' \nIn nearby Tafas , mourners in the funeral procession of Kamal Baradan , killed on Friday in Deraa , set fire to Baath party offices and the police station , residents said . \nThere were also protests on Friday in Damascus and in Hama , a northern city where in 1982 the forces of president Hafez al-Assad , Bashar 's father , killed thousands of people and razed much of the old quarter to put down an armed uprising by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood . \nSyria 's establishment is dominated by members of the minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , a fact that causes resentment among the Sunni Muslims who make up some three-quarters of the population . \nLatakia is mostly Sunni Muslim but has significant numbers of Alawites . \nEdward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , said sectarian friction made many in the establishment wary of giving ground to demands for political freedoms and economic reforms . \n`` They are a basically reviled minority , the Alawites , and if they lose power , if they succumb to popular revolution , they will be hanging from the lamp posts , '' he said . \n`` They have absolutely no incentive to back off . '' \nAsked if there could be a crackdown on the scale of Hama , Faysal Itani , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa Forecasting at Exclusive Analysis , said this was a `` real risk . '' \n`` For a minority regime this is an existential struggle , '' he said . \n`` If the unrest continues at this pace , the Syrian army is not going to be able to maintain cohesion . '' \nMany believed a tipping point had been reached . \n`` The Syrian regime is attempting to make promises such as a potential lifting of the state of emergency , which has been in place since 1963 , a record in the Arab world , '' Bitar said . \n`` But if this happens it will be the end of a whole system , prisoners will have to be released , the press will be free ... when this kind of regime considers relaxing its grip , it also knows that everything could collapse . '' \nCentral Bank Governor Adeeb Mayaleh said the central bank was ready to supply the market with foreign currency liquidity , hinting at rising demand for U.S. dollars . \nSyria has a close alliance with Iran and links to the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite political and military group Hezbollah . \nIts allies in the region have yet to comment on the unrest . \n`` Syria is Iran 's main ally in the Arab world . \nA fall of the regime would have consequences for Hezbollah and Hamas ... I 'm not sure that the region 's big powers would allow such a big shock , '' said Karim Emile Bitar , research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris . \nSyrian border police were stopping a number of Syrians entering from Lebanon , a Lebanese security source said . \n-LRB- Reporting by a Reuters correspondent in Deraa , Yara Bayoumy in Beirut , Arshad Mohammed in Washington , Lionel Laurent in Paris , William Maclean in London ; Dina Zayed in Cairo ; Writing by Peter Millership and Kevin Liffey ; editing by Ralph Boulton -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAsked if a repeat of the sort of wholesale massacre seen at Hama in the 1980s was possible , Itani replied : `` There is a very real risk of such a thing happening . \nFor a minority regime this is an existential struggle . \nMinorities can not afford to let majorities take liberties . \nThey do n't tend to see the middle ground . \n`` The question is not whether they are willing to do it . \nThe question is whether they have enough troops willing to do it . '' \nKARIM EMILE BITAR , research fellow at the Paris-based Institute for International and Strategic Relations `` The Syrian regime will have to reform itself radically if it wants to survive . \nNo country in the region is immune in the face of this revolutionary wind that is blowing from the Atlantic to the Gulf . \n`` The Syrian regime is attempting to make promises such as a potential lifting of the state of emergency , which has been in place since 1963 , a record in the Arab world . \nBut if this happens it will be the end of a whole system , prisoners will have to be released , the press will be free ... when this kind of regime considers relaxing its grip , it also knows that everything could collapse . \n`` I think the army and the secret services will remain faithful to al-Assad right until the end , for reasons that are essentially sectarian -LRB- i.e. preservation of minority Allawite rule -RRB- . \nIn Bahrain they played the Sunni-Shi ` ite card , in Syria we will see the Allawite-Sunni card . \n`` The specter of the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Hama massacre is very present ... but now that there is YouTube , Facebook , Al Jazeera . \nIt 's no longer so easy to crush dissent in this way . \n`` The international community does not have a lot of room for maneuver , but there are nonetheless lines that can not be crossed . \n`` Syria is Iran 's main ally in the Arab world . \nA fall of the regime would have consequences for Hezbollah and Hamas ...

' \nThe three-month-old tide of revolt against Arab rulers seen as repressive , corrupt and unaccountable for unemployment and poverty reached Syria on Friday and gained momentum on Monday as rallies for `` freedom '' spread in the south . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad 's security forces killed four civilians in demonstrations that erupted in the southern city of Deraa on Friday , uncorking the sharpest challenge yet to his 11-year-old rule . \nHis Baath Party has dominated Syria since 1963 . \nIn Libya , where peaceful protests grew into insurrection within weeks , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces besieged the only major rebel city in the west and brought in human shields , residents of Misrata said , to ward off further Western air strikes meant to protect civilians . \nThe first French and British sorties , backed by U.S. missile salvoes , at the weekend halted the Gaddafi forces ' advance on the rebels ' eastern power base of Benghazi and pounded Libyan air defenses to enforce a U.N.-declared no-fly zone . \nAs Western forces prepared to shift from air strikes to air patrols , there was no sign of any gains on the ground by the loosely organized , poorly trained insurgents . \nNevertheless , a senior official with the rebel National Council , based in Benghazi , said the rebels aimed to capture the capital Tripoli and drive out Gaddafi . \nHe welcomed the no-fly zone but again said no foreign ground forces were wanted . \nInternational divisions over intervention in Libya flared into the open on Monday as leaders in Russia and China criticized the air strike policy which neither approved in the U.N. Security Council vote last week . \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air strikes to `` medieval crusades , '' eliciting a rare rebuke from his protege , President Dmitry Medvedev , while China 's official media accused countries involved of inviting new upheaval in the Middle East . \nTurkey and Germany , both members of NATO , voiced further doubt and the Arab League was also divided . \nBAHRAIN SAYS FOREIGN PLOT FOILED In Bahrain , where the absolute Sunni Muslim monarchy has been grappling with a restive Shi'ite majority , said a foreign plot against the Gulf island state had been thwarted . \nThe head of the Gulf Cooperation Council said interference in Gulf state affairs by Iran , the Shi'ite giant across the water from Bahrain , would not be tolerated . \nConfrontation between Bahraini Sunnis and Shi'ites calling for democracy has whipped up international tension in the region . \nAbout 1,000 Saudi soldiers and 500 police officers from the United Arab Emirates entered Bahrain last week to safeguard government facilities . \nKuwaiti naval vessels arrived in Bahrain on Monday to help protect its waters as part of a Gulf defense pact , Bahrain 's state news agency said . \nBahrain is the base for the U.S. Fifth Fleet , central to Washington 's military power in the oil-rich region . \nFrance became the first Western power on Monday to call publicly for Yemen 's Saleh to stand down . \nPan-Arab TV channel Al Arabiya quoted Saleh as saying most Yemenis were with him and he would remain steadfast . \nA government official said the president had asked Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal to mediate in the crisis . \nDefense Minister Mohammad Nasser Ali said the army still backed Saleh , setting the stage for a possible standoff with those commanders who threw in their lot with tens of thousands of protesters who have taken to the street for weeks . \nThe latest defections seemed to be sparked by Yemen 's bloody response to protests on Friday , when plainclothes snipers killed 52 protesters in Sanaa , prompting Saleh to sack his cabinet and declare a 30-day state of emergency . \nIn Syria , hundreds of people demonstrated against the government in the southern town of Jassem , activists said , but authorities did not use force to quell the latest protest . \n`` This is peaceful , peaceful . \nGod , Syria , freedom ! '' \nchanted the protesters in Jassem , an agricultural town near Deraa . \nSyrian Justice Minister Mohamad Ahmad Younis went to Deraa to try to calm emotions and open a dialogue with protesters . \nThe authorities appeared to adopt less heavy-handed tactics , opting not to intervene against protests demanding freedom and an end to graft and repression , but not the overthrow of Assad . \nThe Baath Party has banned opposition and enforced emergency laws since seizing power in a coup 48 years ago . \nThe Pentagon said on Monday Libya air strikes had hamstrung Gaddafi 's might but signaled that the United States would keep the rebels at arm 's length to avoid getting mired in a messy civil conflict amid war weariness over Afghanistan and Iraq . \nGeneral Carter Ham , U.S. commander leading a multinational coalition against Gaddafi , said three days of air and missile strikes had fashioned a broad no-fly zone but Western forces were not providing close air support for Libyan insurgents . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThat is beginning to look mighty fishy ...

{"id": "104", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "BEIRUT | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 3:30 pm GMT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Four days of protests against corruption and stifling one-party rule have finally brought the Arab uprising to Syria , posing the gravest domestic challenge yet to President Bashar al-Assad . \nAt least four people have been killed in the protests and demonstrators have set fire to public buildings in open defiance of authorities known for tolerating no dissent . \nSerious unrest has been confined to the southern city of Deraa , echoing to the chants of `` God , Syria , Freedom , '' but analysts say disenchantment at Assad 's rule and the exhilarating spirit of regional upheaval may fuel wider rebellion . \n`` It is a semi-totalitarian state ... corruption is everywhere , '' said Hazem Saghieh , columnist at pan-Arab Al-Hayat newspaper . \n`` All the reasons are there to expect drastic change . '' \nAny turmoil in Syria would have an impact well beyond its borders . \nUnder Assad and his father before him , Syria has been Iran 's closest Arab ally , a major force in Lebanon , and a supporter of Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups . \nThe Baath Party , which seized power nearly 50 years ago , has governed under emergency laws and banned all opposition . \nOther grievances against authorities include the dominance of Assad 's minority Alawites over the Sunni Muslim majority , corruption , economic hardship and a rising cost of living . \nAssad has said Syria 's foreign policy -- hardline opposition to Israel and support for its foes Hamas and Hezbollah -- means that uniquely among Arab rulers , he is in tune with the mood of his people on one of the most resonant Arab causes . \nBut this so-called `` Syrian exception '' may offer little protection from protesters focussed on domestic demands for more rights , jobs and better living standards . \nWhen the Muslim Brotherhood staged an armed revolt against the late Hafez al-Assad , he sent troops into Hama , killing many thousands and razing part of the city to the ground in 1982 . \nSuch sustained repression -- the military operation in Hama took weeks and was completed before the outside world learned its full extent -- may not be an option in an era where mobile phone footage of protests reaches the Internet in minutes . \n`` The Syrians have shown in the past they are capable of calibrating repression with flexibility , '' said Habib Malik , history professor at the Lebanese American University . \n`` I think they realize what happened in Hama is not possible in today 's world , '' he said , adding that the challenge to Assad , although grave , may still be `` contained or nipped in the bud . '' \nLike other Arab states trying to contain dissent , Syria has reversed decisions on lifting subsidies and has raised salaries . \nVolker Perthes , director of the German Institute for International Politics and Security , said it could also defuse tensions in restive Kurdish regions in the northeast by implementing a pledge to grant citizenship to stateless Kurds . \nA diplomat in Damascus said Assad , who was elected president unopposed when his father died in 2000 , had repeatedly stalled on promised political reform and mistakenly believed that limited economic liberalisation was the key to survival . \n`` They have been trying to put economic band-aids on a wound gushing with the blood of frustration , '' the diplomat said . \n`` Bashar had the time to take pre-emptive moves and embark on genuine reform . \nInstead the regime is making very bad mistakes . '' \nSmaller , possibly coordinated , demonstrations took place after Friday prayers in the central city of Homs and the coastal town of Banias , while a crowd briefly chanted slogans for freedom inside the Ummayad Mosque in Damascus . \nA peaceful demonstration for the release of political prisoners was broken up in Damascus last week . \nBut the scale of the protests in Deraa , where thousands of people have taken to the streets , suggests the real threat to Assad comes less from Syria 's scattered and weakened opposition groups than from spontaneous grassroots protest . \nIf Libyan rebels , now backed by Western military power , make further gains in their fight against Muammar Gaddafi , Syrian protesters would be further emboldened , Saghieh said . \nDemonstrations could then intensify throughout the country , and few expect Assad to follow Egyptian and Tunisian presidents who eventually yielded to mass protests and stood aside . \n`` I think a regime like the Baath regime in Syria would not leave smoothly . \nIt would opt for something like Libya or Yemen , '' said Saghieh . \n`` If it is civil war and anarchy , no one would benefit . \nIranians would lose their ally , but the Israelis would have on their borders a very volatile situation , '' he said . \nSince 2005 , when the United States withdrew its ambassador to Damascus after the assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri , Assad has engineered a rapprochement with the West , but maintained a hard line against criticism at home . \nHe has said he is willing to resume peace talks with Israel , insisting on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights occupied in 1967 , while continuing to position Syria as a champion of Arab resistance to Israel . \n`` The Syrian exception has long rested on the regime 's skill in developing a foreign policy in synch with public opinion -- a unique case in the Arab world . \nBut popular sentiment has refocused around a host of domestic issues left unaddressed for too long , '' said Peter Harling , Damascus-based analyst with the International Crisis Group . \n`` Authorities currently face challenges akin to other regimes of the region , and for the time being are responding in similar fashion . \nThe future now hinges on their ability to reinvent the Syrian exception , by staking out a credible and comprehensive vision for change , '' Harling added . \n`` Repression can only make a volatile situation worse .

'' \nDudani added that she agreed with the former argument and saw more scope for the pound to fall against the dollar . \nRBS sees fair value for the pair at $ 1.55 , she said . \nGiven the spotlight on euro zone debt problems , market participants said the pound showed limited reaction to data showing the economy grew only modestly in the second quarter . \nSigns that the economy is struggling to recover have been dogging the pound , as such fragility is expected to keep the Bank of England from raising interest rates anytime soon . \nThe central bank has acknowledged the possibility that it may even consider more quantitative easing if the economy is unable to snap out of its rout . \nLow interest rates and QE are negative for sterling as they add to its rate disadvantage versus other currencies were rates are rising . \nSterling fell around 0.6 percent on the day to a session low of $ 1.5946 . \nIt retreated from a session high of $ 1.6042 after early gains fizzled ahead of resistance at $ 1.6048 , the 200-day moving average . \nThe pound offered little reaction to data from the Chambers of Commerce indicated that the economy expanded by 0.3 percent in April-June , and that a slowdown in export demand suggests the recovery is shaky . \nBroad demand for safe-haven dollars , the world 's most liquid currency , kept the pound in range of $ 1.5912 , and a fall below this level would take sterling to its weakest in more than five months . \nTraders said a test of the $ 1.5900 level was possible in the near term , particularly if the euro continues to suffer . \n`` The risk is for a break lower , '' said a trader in London . \n`` It probably needs a lower EUR\\/USD to spark the move but with EZ debt , lack of UK growth and no chance of UK rate rise soon I guess eventual downside break is likely . '' \nThe euro slipped 0.3 percent to 88.40 pence , its weakest since late June . \nThe single currency has been unable to maintain gains above 90 pence hit earlier this month . \nDudani at RBS said that level would provide strong resistance , and that any rise above that level would offer an opportunity to sell , given ongoing debt risks in the euro zone . \nDisdain for sterling was reflected in the latest IMM data on speculator positioning , which showed a jump in the net short positions in the pound -- bets to sell the currency -- to 31,669 contracts last week , the highest in roughly a year . \nWhile hefty positioning in favor of the pound 's downside adds to the view that investors are keen to sell the currency , it can also be seen as a warning sign of an impending shift in positioning , which may result in a correction . \n-LRB- Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu ; Editing by Toby Chopra -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nStephan Miller , a spokesman for Israel 's mayor of Jerusalem , Nir Barkat , dismissed the report . \nHe said in a statement it was based on `` misleading facts , blatant lies and political spin about Jerusalem , so I 'm sure the UN will enjoy it . '' \nIsrael seized East Jerusalem , including the Old City , in the 1967 Middle East war . \nIt later annexed the area and surrounding West Bank villages into a Jerusalem municipality that it declared the united and eternal capital of Israel . \nPalestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and world powers have not recognized the annexation . \nThere are some 300,000 Palestinians residents in East Jerusalem , representing about 35 percent of the city 's total population , but ICAHD said that since Israel took control of largely Arab areas it had systematically prevented their development . \nOne third of land in East Jerusalem was taken for the construction of Jewish neighborhoods , while only nine percent of the remaining land is legally available for housing . \nThis has all been built on , making expansion impossible . \nICAHD said it was virtually impossible for Palestinians to obtain building permits to house their growing families . \n`` They have no other option than to leave East Jerusalem , build illegally or live in appalling , cramped conditions , '' said Emily Schaeffer , who authored the report . \nThose who leave lose residency rights if they are gone for seven or more years and can not return . \nSome 14,000 Palestinians lost their residency between 1967 and 2010 , with half of those revocations taking place after 2006 , ICAHD said . \nResidency entitles you to Israeli health care and national insurance benefits . \nThose who built houses illegally , lived in fear of having their property demolished and also faced hefty fines . \nIsrael demolished more than 2,000 homes in East Jerusalem since 1967 , with 771 being pulled down between 2000-2011 . \nA further 1,500 demolition orders are pending execution . \n`` Palestinians will de facto be deported from East Jerusalem , not by using guns or trucks , but by not allowing them to live a decent , normal life , '' Sfard said . \nBecause the annexation of East Jerusalem was not recognized , Palestinians living there should be considered as a people under occupation , ICAHD said . \nAs such , Israel had no right to strip them of residency or demolish their homes . \n`` There is a suspicion that a war crime is taking place and that is why an investigation should take place , '' said Sfard . \nA statement from the Israeli mayor 's office which said that while East Jerusalem had suffered from a lack of investment in the past that had now changed . \nIt said Barkat had `` invested an unprecedented amount of resources and efforts to improve the quality of life of Muslim residents of Jerusalem after decades of neglect by previous administrations .

Security Council resolution to condemn Syria 's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters was a warning against Western meddling in their own countries and others worldwide . \nPutin may use the trip to show the West an emphasis on China as Russia 's geopolitical partner and a customer for its energy . \nHe did just that in a televised meeting with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller on October 3 , pointedly ordering him to prepare proposals on expansion into Asian markets , seen as a way to diversify Russian energy exports away from stagnant Europe . \nPresident Dmitry Medvedev has not been cool to China since Putin steered him into the Kremlin after his own 2000-2008 presidency , but his emphasis has been on presenting a friendlier face to the West and improving ties with the United States . \nPutin 's meeting with Miller followed European Commission raids on offices of Gazprom subsidiaries in Europe that underscored persistent tensions over the continent 's heavy reliance on Russian gas , which EU members want to reduce . \nBut China 's friendly political ties with Russia , and their partnership in the loose BRIC grouping that also includes India and Brazil , do not make Beijing less of a tough customer when it comes to energy deals . \nPutin will likely seek to resolve the price disagreements that have prevented Russia nailing down a 30-year deal to supply China with up to 68 billion cubic metres of gas per year . \nBut Gazprom 's export chief told Reuters last month that the five-year-old negotiations might not end this year , pushing back initial deliveries beyond the latest target of 2016 . \nMeanwhile , China is cultivating other sources of energy supplies , particularly in ex-Soviet Central Asia . \nA report this month by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute -LRB- SIPRI -RRB- said China was gaining the upper hand in the relationship as it becomes less reliant on Russia for advanced weapons and looks elsewhere for some of its energy . \nIt said Russia 's significance to China would continue to diminish in the coming years , and that `` there are strategic planners in Beijing and Moscow who view the other side as the ultimate strategic threat in the long term . \nWhile Putin may use China as a foil against the West , the pragmatic former KGB officer is well aware of such concerns . \nAs he prepares for what could be two six-year terms as president , `` the risks from China 's growth will be watched more closely than the opportunities , '' said Fyodor Lukyanov , editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs . \nAt an investor conference on Thursday , Putin used a joke to play down the challenge posed by China 's faster growth after TPG Capital co-founder David Bonderman outlined China 's path to becoming the world 's largest economy . \n`` He got me worried . \nHe said that the United States is so far the world 's biggest economy but China will undoubtedly take over . \nSo we now need to keep our foreign currency reserves in yuan while the Chinese will keep them in dollars , '' Putin said . \n`` That will be an interesting Russian doll .

'' \n`` Today there was an attack on Jabal al-Zawi and the Ghab region and military jets bombarded civilians who had escaped to the mountains . \nUntil now three have been martyred , and 27 are missing . \nI have the names of the martyrs , '' he said , pulling out a folded piece of paper with three names scribbled in Arabic . \nThe 50-year-old colonel , who served as an engineer in Syria 's air force for 31 years , said the Syrian government had started to harass him and other officers when pro-democracy protests first started in Tunisia . \n`` During the revolution in Tunisia , the regime started getting ready . \nIt felt there will be a revolution in Syria . \nSo it -LRB- stepped up security -RRB- , hired spies to harass us . \nWe were always under surveillance , '' he said . \nAs ` aad said he was summoned to the air force intelligence department in Aleppo where he was coerced into confessing there were armed groups among his relatives because there were demonstrations in his village . \nIt was after this that he deserted . \nAs ` aad says he commands the Syrian Free Army , which he helped form after his defection and that they had joined forces with another rebel force , the Free Officers movement , which activists have said is led by Lieutenant Abdelrahman Sheikh inside Syria . \n`` We 're all one group , we 're all one army . \nWe 're all waiting , the defecting brothers are working inside , '' he said . \nAs ` aad said 10-15 ,000 soldiers , out of the roughly 200,000-strong military , had defected all over the country and that desertions were continuing every day . \n`` The Syrian army 's morale is tired . \nDefections are happening daily . \nthere are several units that have lost their function because of the defections , '' he said . \n`` The regime is weakening and the biggest proof , is that they 're using air support in addition to tanks and artillery , that proves their weakness .

'' \nThe government also allocated 2 billion ringgit of infrastructure projects for bumiputras , most of whom are ethnic Malays . \nIt offered tax breaks for Islamic bond issuance , raised civil servant pensions and announced that it would list the global arm of its plantation group FELDA . \nNajib forecast that the economy would grow 5-6 percent in 2012 , while the fiscal deficit would fall further on the strength of robust domestic demand and commodities exports . \nReflecting the downdraft on Asia from the slowdown in the United States and Europe , the government trimmed its 2011 economic growth target to 5.0-5 .5 percent from 5.0-6 .0 percent earlier . \nIts fiscal deficit will shrink further to 4.7 percent of gross domestic product next year from 5.4 percent in 2011 as it reduces development spending , confirming an earlier Reuters report . \n-LRB- ID : Analysts said the 2012 spending plan was tailored to woo voters , particularly the majority ethnic Malays whose support is split between Najib and the opposition . \n`` This a populist budget , he is trying to be popular with everyone , give goodies here and there so everyone wo n't do too badly , '' said James Chin , a political analyst at Monash University in Malaysia . \n`` What is surprising is the allocation to bumiputras . \nThis was what Malay rights groups have been clamouring for but it 's a smaller allocation as they asked for 30 percent of the project . \nHe is definitely trying to shore up ethnic Malay support .

'' \nBut Turkey 's policy shift , which has aligned Ankara more closely with the West , comes with risks . \n`` Syrian intelligence might use every opportunity to instigate Kurdish violence , '' Aktar said , referring to Turkey 's restive minority population . \nAktar said Turkey , whose clout in the Middle East has grown out of a combination of economic growth and secular democracy , could see goodwill evaporate if it is perceived to be meddling in Syria . \n`` At the end of the day , Turkey risks being told to mind its own business and to first put its house in order . \nThe more it wants to be a soft power the more it is going to be told by the international community to apply the same standards with its Kurds minority . '' \nFor all their closeness over the past decade , the two countries almost went to war in the late 1990s over Syria giving refuge to Kurdish militants fighting the Turkish state . \nLiving under Turkish protection , Syrian Colonel Riad al-As ` aad exhorts his former comrades to desert to organize the armed struggle he believes is needed to drive Assad from power . \n`` We assure them -LRB- the Syrian people -RRB- they should be patient , and God willing , very soon , Bashar will be between their hands , '' As ` aad told Reuters in an interview on Thursday . \n-LRB- nL5E7L642X -RRB- `` We must be patient . \nWe hope the Syrian people will be stronger and remain committed to continue to bring down the regime . '' \nRevolted by the killing of Syrian civilians , and seeing the tide of history turn with the `` Arab Spring '' of popular uprisings , Turkey has calculated that its long term interest lies in supporting the Syrian people 's struggle for democracy . \nThat Syria , like Turkey , has a Sunni Muslim majority , while Assad and his clique belong to the Alawite minority , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , made that choice even simpler . \nThe breakdown in their relationship leaves Iran as Syria 's closest backer , though the Russian and Chinese vetoes earlier this week of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution censuring Syria showed Assad retains some support elsewhere . \nAnti-Assad factions meeting in Istanbul -- ranging from Islamists through liberals , along with ethnic and tribal leaders -- have coalesced under a revolutionary Syrian National Council with a stated aim of ousting Assad within six months . \nOffering itself as a potential future interim government , this broad-based opposition group has helped instill some confidence among governments , like Turkey , who disapprove of Assad but had not known who to support . \nHitherto , they have feared Assad 's fall would leave Syria without a central authority capable of stopping the country sliding into religious , sectarian and ethnic violence . \nOne Western diplomat , asked about Turkey 's hesitation in the past to ditch Assad , said Ankara had come to see Assad as `` the devil we know . '' \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who had previously enjoyed a close rapport with Assad , is expected to visit a camp in the border province of Hatay sheltering some of the 7,500 Syrians who have fled the violence at home . \nDue to the death of his mother , Erdogan delayed a visit that had been set for Sunday , but he has already promised to announce sanctions against the Syrian government . \nTurkey is expected to freeze bank accounts held by members of Assad 's inner circle , cut ties with Syrian state banks , and halt deals between state-run companies , notably in oil and gas , while avoiding measures that could hurt the people . \nErdogan predicted last month that Assad will be ousted `` sooner or later , '' but how far he is willing to go to make it happen is an open question . \n`` What we have at the moment ... is a war of words between Assad and Erdogan , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . \n`` It 's a bit like two jilted lovers , because they were very , very close . \nThere is a lot of personal spite . '' \nCompounding tensions this week , Turkey began military exercises in Hatay province , which Syria has had longstanding claims over since it was ceded to Turkey in 1939 when France controlled Syria and Lebanon . \nThe exercises , relatively small-scale logistical drills involving a large contingent of less experienced reservist troops , are seen as a symbolic reminder to Damascus that the second largest army in NATO is just across the border . \n`` It is part of the Turkish government 's campaign to apply increased psychological pressure on the regime in Damascus because previous warnings have gone unheeded , '' said Fadi Hakura , analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London . \nTurkey has begun intercepting arms bound for Syria passing through its waters and air space . \nSome analysts say it is easy to foresee Turkey eventually helping to equip and organize Syrian rebels , like Colonel As ` aad , who want to wage an armed struggle against those units of Assad 's security forces leading the repression of protesters . \nOther analysts believe it would be a mistake for Turkey to go beyond support for peaceful protests by letting itself become a rear base for an armed opposition or being seen as a provocateur in Syria 's internal conflict , especially if it developed a stronger sectarian dimension . \nTurkey , after all , is vulnerable to mischief-making among ethnic Kurds and developments that could cause unease within its own Alevi minority community . \nSpeculation keeps resurfacing that Turkey 's military could end up entering Syria to create a buffer zone for the protection of Syrians from Assad 's security forces . \nDuring the 1991 Gulf War , about half a million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey , returning only after Western powers , along with Turkish contingents , set up a safe haven across the border . \nBut analysts see this option still as a last resort for Ankara , and one that is unlikely to be taken without first getting a U.N. mandate . \nAs it has done in other Arab countries gripped by upheaval , Turkey has played on sentimental attachments to the Ottoman era , when Istanbul counted vast swathes of Arabia , North Africa and the Balkans among its dominions . \nWhereas Erdogan has earned admiration among Arabs for championing the Palestinian cause and leading democratic change in Turkey , analysts say Arabs would not like to see Turkish troops crossing into Syria . \n`` I do n't think Turkey ... would be stupid enough to intervene militarily , '' Jenkins said . \n`` The Arab world does n't want to see Turkish boots on the ground in an Arab country .

'' \nCompanies may also shift some of their output abroad to meet the targets , said Shigeru Suehiro , senior economist at the Institution of Energy Economics , Japan . \nTokyo Electric , still struggling with a prolonged safety crisis at its Fukushima nuclear complex , said on Friday that it would be able to meet power demand for the next two months , although just barely . \nThe ministry 's proposal requires big manufacturers to submit power-saving plans , such as adjustments to operating hours , and would subject them to modest penalties of 1 million yen -LRB- 7,164 pounds -RRB- if they fail to reach the targets . \nThey could also be publicly identified as not meeting government requirements . \nThe proposals , due to be finalized by the end of the month and Japan 's first government-imposed power curbs since the 1974 oil crisis , would require the reductions on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. , when air-conditioning use would be heaviest . \nKaieda said the government was not considering raising electricity rates to curb demand . \n-LRB- Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori ; Editing by Edmund Klamann -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' `` Each of these situations is unique , '' she added . \n`` We deplore the violence in Syria , we call as we have on all of these governments ... to be responding to their people 's needs , not to engage in violence , permit peaceful protests and begin a process of economic and political reform , '' she said . \nAnalysts and a U.S. lawmaker said if the situation in Syria deteriorated , the United States may face calls for military action in a fourth Muslim country beyond Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya . \nClinton said there was not the same level of violence in Syria and the government 's crackdown on protests had not yet garnered global condemnation or calls from the Arab League and others for a no-fly zone as there was with Libya . \n`` What 's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning , but there 's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities , than police actions which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see , '' she added . \nSenator Joseph Lieberman , an independent , suggested the United States and other countries could intervene militarily in Syria if President Bashar al-Assad , who came to power after the 2000 death of his father , Hafez , attacked protesters with greater ferocity . \n`` There 's a precedent now that the world community has said in Libya , and it 's the right one , ` we 're not going to stand by and allow this Assad to slaughter his people like his father did years ago , ' '' Lieberman told the `` Fox News Sunday '' program . \nEdward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and Israel , said he would be reluctant to get involved militarily in Syria because the United States has so much on its plate , including winding down the war in Iraq and fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan . \nAsked if he could see the United States moving beyond its condemnation of the violence against protesters and its call for restraint by the Syrian authorities , Walker replied : `` No. . \nNot unless the situation gets considerably worse . \n`` If we start seeing a situation like existed in Hama , where you 've got a government waging war on its own population and the numbers -LRB- of deaths -RRB- are significantly larger , it 's going to put the administration in a terrible position , '' he said . \nIf that happened , Walker said the Obama administration would face questions like `` why are we fooling around in Libya and not getting involved in Syria ?

{"id": "238", "time": "2011-04-06", "text": "AMMAN | Wed Apr 6 , 2011 5:01 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Senior Syrian army ranks are packed with loyal members of President Bashar al-Assad 's Alawite minority , reducing any prospect of military pressure on him to stand aside if protests grow , military experts say . \nUnlike the armies in Tunisia and Egypt , whose refusal to confront non-violent demonstrations spelt the demise of their autocratic rulers , the fate of many senior Syrian military officers is closely tied to that of Assad . \nAlthough some officers from the Sunni Muslim majority have been promoted to senior ranks , Sunni influence has been weakened and Assad 's brother Maher controls key military units packed with Alawite soldiers . \n`` It will take an extraordinary amount of people power to defeat a regime this deeply entrenched . \nThis is not Tunisia , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , research professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Army War college . \n`` The regime has been careful about placing Alawite loyalists in all key positions within the military so that the regime can defeat any effort to overthrow it . \nSome Sunni officers have risen to very high ranks but have very little power to command troops , '' Terrill said from Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania . \nThe Assad family which has ruled Syria for 41 years comes from the Alawite mountains overlooking the Mediterranean , a stronghold of the secretive sect with links to Shi'ite Islam . \nAssad , who faces the greatest threat to his rule from more than two weeks of protests calling for an end to emergency law and one-party rule , has responded with a blend of force -- his security forces have killed dozens of protesters -- and vague promises of reform . \nResidents of Deraa , cradle of the Syrian protests , say Alawite forces commanded by Assad 's younger brother Maher have taken up positions around the southern city . \nMaher controls the Presidential Guard , the Republican Guard , and the Fourth Armoured Division -- key units that form the security backbone of the state together with the Alawite-dominated secret police . \n`` Some observers consider Maher al-Assad to be excessively violent and emotionally volatile . \nIt appears that President Assad views his brother as totally trustworthy , '' said Terrill , a specialist in Syrian military affairs . \nAlthough family ties ensure the loyalty of the top brass , Assad can not antagonize the army rank-and-file with a repeat of the 1982 crackdown on the city of Hama , when his father Hafez al-Assad sent commandos , paratroopers and Baath Party irregulars to put down an armed uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood . \nHafez al-Assad 's brother Rifaat personally managed the Hama operation , in which tens of thousands were killed and parts of the city flattened . \n`` Syria 2011 is not Syria 1982 . \nYou have hundreds of thousands of soldiers -- conscripts and professional soldiers -- who have seen only corruption and abuse of position by their Alawite commanders , '' said a former Syrian army member . \n`` It will be very dangerous for Bashar to play this game . \n`` The army will not ask Bashar to step down , as was the case in Egypt and Tunisia , but he can not easily ask the army to commit massacres either , '' the ex-soldier said . \nAssad would also be hesitant to use Maher 's Republican Guard to quell protest because it would increase resentment against Alawites , he said . . \nAnother military expert working for a Western government said the Syrian army would fracture if the Alawite ruling hierarchy attempted a repeat of the Hama massacre , but the president could get away with smaller scale killings . \n`` It would also depend on how the killings are presented . \nThere is a difference between shooting peaceful protesters and killing demonstrators who attack security forces , '' he said . \nAlthough Deraa residents say Maher al-Assad 's units are positioned around the city , Alawite secret police and special police units have deployed to confront demonstrators . \nMore than 40 protesters have been killed in the clashes , witnesses said . \nTerrill said Alawite units would have no qualms suppressing dissent because they have been indoctrinated to believe their community would lose out if majority Sunnis attain power . \n`` It can be safely assumed that virtually all of the Alawites within the military will fight to defend the regime . '' \nAsked if Sunni soldiers could revolt if they saw more of their co-religionists killed , Terrill said : `` Syria 's security organs will move quickly and ruthlessly to suppress even the germs of revolt within the military .

'' \nAnalysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown , including the arrest , disappearance and torture to death of hundreds of men . \nIslamists , long persecuted by the security forces , have their own axe to grind . \n`` The security solution has n't worked . \nThe regime has decided to go for civil strife because it senses that it is losing . \nThe protests are spilling over and spreading to the capital , '' said a Damascus-based Arab journalist who declined to be named . \nAlawite villagers say authorities have been arming young men to fight the insurgency . \nMutilated bodies of some Shabbiha men , handed over by security forces to their families for burial , served to incite sectarian hatred in those villages . \nSectarian paranoia is evident , with Assad trusting only two elite units commanded by his brother Maher -- the 4th Armoured Division and the Republican Guard -- as well as secret police and Alawite militia , known as Shabbiha , to deal with dissent . \n`` The coherence -LRB- of the security forces -RRB- is already in question . \nSectarianism is already a problem , the loyalty of other units can not be counted on , '' Rogan said . \nWhile the authorities blame the upheaval on a `` bunch of Islamists , '' the reality appears more complex . \nSome Syria-watchers say the protest movement is driven mainly by youths and includes rural Sunni tribes , nationalists , leftists , secularists and also Islamists , united in their goal of overthrowing an autocratic and corrupt government . \nGeographically , the protests have spread since March to many rural and tribal regions , cities such as Hama and Homs , and even to Damascus , although not on a huge scale in the capital . \nSecurity forces and Shabbiha militiamen , armed with metal bars , are everywhere . \nThe army has deployed tanks around the main cities to keep out protesters from the countryside . \n`` The savagery of the regime has increased 180 degrees . \nThe hostility against it has massively increased too among ordinary people , not just protesters . \nThere are widescale arrests in all areas , in cities and villages , '' the Syrian journalist said . \nResidents said the Alawite units , though overstretched , have stepped up their offensive and are showing resilience in facing the growing demonstrations . \nThe protest movement , however , is growing and showing no sign of dying down , residents add . \nIn a country where once no one dared utter a word against the president , chants such as : `` Bashar you butcher we wo n't rest until we bury you '' show how fearless the activists have become . \nGraffiti on rubbish bins read : `` Bashar : this is your final grave . '' \nToppling the system , analysts say , is hazardous because of Syria 's power structure under which Alawites hold key posts in the military and Assad family insiders run the key security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . \nSarkis Naoum , an expert on Syrian affairs , said Assad was not likely to be overthrown quickly , but the conflict could develop into a bloody civil war . \n`` It is not clear how it would evolve and how much time it would take . \nThe regime can not win and also the opposition can not win either , '' said Naoum , a columnist at Beirut 's an-Nahar daily . \nWhat complicates the Syrian scene is that the Assads will fight to the end rather than leave because they fear that their family and their sect would be targeted under Sunni rule . \n`` The Assads wo n't relinquish power . \nThey are refusing reform because it will make them have to give up power , '' Naoum said . \nRogan said that Assad 's departure was not imminent . \n`` It is a long way before we reach the point where Bashar has to go . \nThe regime is a lot stronger than people like to think but Assad is weak and has no sense of leadership . '' \nThe protests have virtually crippled Damascus . \nShops open for a few hours during the day and close early . \nBusiness activity is grounded and many people have lost their jobs . \nThe city , which once buzzed with night life , is tense and eerie after dark . \nSigns of stretched resources and a strained economy are very evident . \nThe Syrian economy could prove to be Assad 's curse . \nWith no end in sight to the crackdown on protesters , the country 's key revenue streams look shattered . \nA more marked decline in Syria 's economic health may force the regime to fall . \nAfter growing at an average of 5 percent over the last five years , the economy is forecast to contract as much as 3 percent this year as tourism , which accounts for 23 percent of Syria 's hard currency earnings , and foreign investment grind to a halt . \nWith hotels almost empty and the growing likelihood of oil sanctions , Syria is desperately trying to retain local and foreign currency by increasing interest rates on deposits and curbing foreign currency sales . \nTehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , is reported to have come to his help in funds and expertise . \nIran is considering offering $ 5.8 billion -LRB- 3.5 billion pound -RRB- in financial help , French business newspaper Les Echos said . \nIran , which quashed its own pro-democracy youth movement after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election in 2009 , has sent experts to help the Syrian authorities monitor and jam satellite communication and the Internet , according to Ausama Monajed of the Syrian opposition . \nThe opposition said the government had been finding it hard to monitor the activists ' communications until the Iranians stepped in , providing authorities with Chinese and North Korean equipment to intercept and eavesdrop on conversations . \nMonajed , spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Europe , said the opposition is lobbying to raise funds and rally world opinion to slap more sanctions against Assad and his aides . \nWhile close observers of Syria weigh the multiple scenarios , none of them appears to have a neat end . \n`` The sooner this mafia is gone the better , '' Rogan said . \n`` A lot worse can happen trying to get rid of these guys than we have seen already . '' \nSeale said : `` The more blood is spilt the more difficult is to find a solution . \nThere has to be a negotiated solution of sort . \nIf there is no solution there will be a civil war . '' \n"}
{"id": "66", "time": "2011-07-26", "text": "Chancellor George Osborne walks into Downing Street in London March 23 , 2011 . \nLONDON | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 3:56 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - George Osborne 's `` Age of Austerity '' mantra was the kind of tough medicine his Conservative party and voters wanted to hear as Britain dragged itself out of the financial crisis and faced up to a mountain of unsustainable debt . \nThe son of a baronet and heir to a successful wallpaper business was key in placing a harsh austerity plan at the heart of his party 's 2010 election campaign and it paid off as voters turned on a 13-year-old Labor government . \nBut there was one glaring hole in the argument . \nWhile avoiding credit downgrades was seen as the best way to stabilise any recovery , there was little evidence that a finance-starved private sector could make up for Osborne 's retrenchment in government spending . \nBut the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government under Prime Minister David Cameron knows it must stick to its guns in the hope that the economy will improve by the time of the 2015 election . \nDismal figures for the second quarter of this year on Tuesday -- growth of just 0.2 percent after the economy effectively flatlined in the previous six months -- may have just called Osborne 's bluff . \n`` We were somehow promised this double mantra of cutting debt but also miraculously sustained and ever rising economic growth -- it 's in a dream world that you can achieve these things , '' said Jonathan Tonge , professor of politics at the University of Liverpool . \n`` The jury is still out on this coalition government . \nPeople do n't necessarily trust its economic strategy to deliver and people are still suspicious that there is a slight ` fetish-isation ' of spending cuts because there are Conservatives involved . '' \nWhere Osborne had so easily sold his austerity and growth plans last year , the media-shy Conservative is now finding it hard to explain why it does not seem to be working . \nMany major Western economies are struggling to get going again after the credit crunch , but Britain is lagging behind . \nEconomists polled by Reuters earlier this month showed a consensus expecting 2.5 percent growth in the United States , 3.4 percent growth in Germany and 1.3 percent in Britain . \nThe government 's deficit plan -- to all but eliminate a budget deficit of about 10 percent of national output over four years -- is based on forecasts for 1.7 percent this year . \nOsborne has so far managed to avoid much of the criticism . \nLesser ministers have been wheeled out , often from the smaller Lib Dem side of the coalition , to announce austerity measures and then face the wrath of protesters . \nLike his former Labor nemesis Gordon Brown -- who ruled the Treasury for a decade before taking over from Tony Blair as prime minister in 2007 -- Osborne has learned the knack of disappearing and leaving others to face the music . \nDaily Telegraph columnist Jeremy Warner compares him to TS Eliot 's Macavity the mystery cat , marvelling at his `` ability to float , like the fakir in Eliot 's Macavity , above the wreckage of the coalition 's first , turbulent year in office . '' \nBut dangers lie ahead for a man who is said to have his heart set on the top political job and is widely recognized as a strategic force within the government . \nQuestions have been asked about his role in the hiring of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as Cameron 's communications chief after the phone hacking scandal engulfed Rupert Murdoch 's British media operations . \nThe Conservatives have been accused of getting too cosy with Murdoch 's empire in their quest for political glory as have their Labor opponents . \nOsborne has not escaped the backlash . \nPerhaps more worryingly , reports suggest Cameron is becoming frustrated with the lack of economic growth . \nThis could be the year it all goes sour for the Cameron-Osborne axis of power , although Osborne dismissed those fears on Tuesday . \n`` Their past comradeship offers no guarantees , '' said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities . \n`` Latest reports that the prime minister is not happy with the chancellor 's performance could presage deep trouble for the coalition government . \n`` There is much concern in some quarters that the shortfall in growth ... will result in an overshoot in government borrowing relative to budget plans . \nThis can not be ruled out . '' \nAny sustained slippage in the coalition 's deficit reduction plans could see Britain at the mercy of the credit ratings agencies once again . \nA risk of a downgrade would be a disaster for Osborne who promised to safeguard Britain 's top notch triple-A rating . \nAt the same time , deficit hawks say that going soft on spending cuts would prove just as disastrous . \n`` If he goes off track with the spending cuts , then of course the markets could pounce , '' said Richard Wellings , deputy editorial director at the Institute of Economic Affairs told Reuters Insider . \n`` I think really the current spending cuts are the minimum that are credible for the markets . '' \nIt may not look good this week , but there is time for Osborne 's gamble to pay off , even if success could prolong Cameron 's reign and reduce his chances of leading the Conservatives . \nFinancial markets were pleasantly surprised by the meager growth in the second quarter , having gambled on an even weaker number , and most polls show the public back Osborne 's plans . \nMost analysts agree that any climbdown would be political suicide . \n`` Let 's be quite clear , weak GDP growth does not mean that we should resort to Plan B with fiscal policy , '' said Graeme Leach , chief economist at the Institute of Directors . \n-LRB- Reporting by Matt Falloon ; editing by Elizabeth Piper -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nSome Iraqis said regional turmoil had also prompted them to change their travel plans to neighbouring countries . \nA wave of pro-democracy protests across parts of the Middle East and North Africa this year sparked a civil war in Libya and a violent crackdown by Syria 's government has killed 2,000 people , the United Nations says . \n`` Sometimes we go to Turkey and to Syria , but in Syria there is bad security , so we changed . \nInstead of going to Syria , we came here , '' said Aziz Abbas , a 50-year-old Higher Education ministry employee from Samarra who was visiting Arbil . \nIraq itself has not been immune to protests . \nDemonstrators took to the streets earlier this year over jobs and poor services . \nRallies in Sulaimaniya by protesters who said they were seeking an end to corruption and authoritarian rule were met by a big show of force by the Kurdistan Regional Government . \nProtests in Arbil were small . \n"}

'' \n`` During the protest , two officers and three soldiers refused to open fire so we carried them on our shoulders . \nAfter that , we were surprised to see helicopters firing on us .

{"id": "27", "time": "2011-06-10", "text": "A pro-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad supporter , who rallied to a Facebook call to sit-in to support the army at Arnous square , carries his picture in Damascus June 7 , 2011 , after the Syrian troops with tanks moved on Tuesday towards Jisr al-Shughour town , where the government has vowed to quell a revolt after accusing gunmen of killing scores of security men . \nBEIRUT | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 8:44 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fears that Syria may slide into civil war are growing after a week when the government said over 120 servicemen were killed at a town near the Turkish border . \nAs it sent tanks on Friday into Jisr al-Shughour , a mainly Sunni Muslim town whose 50,000 inhabitants had mostly fled , the cause of last weekend 's bloodshed was still in dispute -- state media blamed unidentified gunmen but democracy activists said troops mutinied after refusing to fire on unarmed demonstrators . \nWhatever the truth , the killings suggest either cracks within President Bashar al-Assad 's security forces or the beginnings of an armed revolt -- or some combination of the two . \nEither way , the scale of the killing in an area prone to tension between Syria 's Sunni majority and Assad 's Alawite sect points to a bloodier turn of events after three months of unrest against 41 years of Alawite-dominated Assad family rule . \nThat in turn would rock the entire Middle East , where Syria , Iran 's main Arab ally , sits at the heart of numerous conflicts . \n`` The country is sliding toward civil war . \nIt is a step toward civil war , '' said Syria expert Joshua Landis , associate professor of Middle East studies at Oklahoma University . \nHe noted that the poor area around Jisr al-Shughour , lying at the foot of the `` Alawite Mountain , '' the heartland of the dominant minority sect , was home to conservative Sunni Muslims . \nMany Syrians who joined the Sunni Islamist insurgency in Iraq against U.S. forces came from that region , he added . \n`` It 's got a history of anti-government agitations , '' Landis said . \n`` The Islamic currents are very strong there . '' \nIn 1980 , the late Hafez al-Assad , who preceded his son as president , crushed a Sunni revolt in Jisr al-Shughour , which lies on a strategically important road between Syria 's second city Aleppo and the main Mediterranean port of Latakia . \nTwo years later , Assad 's forces put down an armed uprising in Hama by the Sunni Islamist Muslim Brotherhood , killing many thousands and razing the old town -- an event which still resonates for Syrians considering challenging their rulers . \nThose who have taken a lead in demonstrating for reforms , inspired by the Tunisian and Egyptian protests which launched the Arab Spring , stress their insistence on non-violent action . \nFew are willing to speak publicly about taking up arms . \nAnd some dismiss talk of sectarian and ethnic violence as scaremongering by Assad loyalists intent on keeping power . \nHowever , in conversations this week with a number of Syrian activists , several said they believed some of Assad 's opponents were already using weapons , including arms smuggled from abroad . \n`` Some people have taken up arms against the security forces in Jisr al-Shughour . \nWe know that , '' said one activist who , like many , would speak on the subject only on condition of anonymity . \n`` The question is : Is this limited ? \nOr is it going to spread to other cities ? '' \nAfter years of repression , it is hard to establish the strength in Syria of organised movements like the Muslim Brotherhood , let alone of other anti-government groups . \nAs in several other towns , residents in Jisr al-Shughour have accused Alawite militiamen , known as shabiha and fiercely loyal to the Assads , of helping the security forces . \nTwo activists said armed Sunni men , as well as shabiha groups , had set up rival sets of checkpoints on roads -- an echo of the kind of sectarian tension familiar from neighboring Lebanon and Iraq . \nGuns are widely available across Syria . \n`` People have taken arms , '' Landis at Oklahoma University said . \n`` Things are about to get a lot worse than we thought . '' \nLouay Hussein , an activist in Damascus , said he did not know of Sunnis taking up arms in the northwest of the country . \nBut he told Reuters from the capital : `` We have warned the authorities from the beginning that the excessive use of violence will , in the end , allow armed groups to use violence against them . '' \nAssad has responded to protests , which began in the southern Sunni town of Deraa , by offering discussions on reform but also by sending in security forces to detain and kill demonstrators . \nThe government insists it is willing to listen but rejects Western pressure for radical changes . \nIt points out Syria has a potentially volatile mix of ethnic and religious communities , including Christians and Kurds , as well as Sunnis and Alawites . \n`` Syria is a mosaic , '' Syrian government spokeswoman Reem Haddad told Al Jazeera this week . \n`` It is made of many different sects living together . '' \nMany in the Christian and Alawite minorities say they support reforms , but fear that calls for the overthrow of Assad could fragment the country of 20 million and hand it over to hardline Sunni Islamists who would persecute other religions . \nAssad 's initial response to the protests has included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds , lifting a draconian state of emergency , freeing hundreds of prisoners and calling for a national dialogue . \nProtests , triggered by anger and frustration at corruption , poverty and lack of freedoms , have been mainly peaceful , though rights groups say the death toll among protesters is over 1,100 . \nAt least 200 security personnel have also been killed , the government says . \nActivists say that at least some of the dead soldiers were killed for disobeying orders to stop protests . \nSyria has expelled Reuters correspondents and barred most foreign media , preventing independent reporting from Syria . \nFayez Sara , an opposition figure who was detained earlier in the uprising , said he still has hopes that a political solution might save the country from descending into chaos . \n`` We should try till the last minute because otherwise the price tag will be high , '' he told Reuters from Damascus . \n`` When we say the time has ran out for a political solution , this means we are opening the country to civil war . '' \nWestern powers and their Arab allies have voiced concern but show no appetite for Libya-style intervention in Syria . \nThe gravity of the situation particularly alarms some across the border in Lebanon , where officials with ties to Syria privately express concern that some areas may be headed for chaos . \nA Lebanese analyst , who is close to some opposition figures in Syria , said : `` We have been warning our Syrian brothers but they do not want to listen . \nThey think the civil war in Lebanon and in Iraq will not reach them . \nThey are wrong . '' \nThe possibility of splits in the armed forces , where the top command ranks and elite units are largely Alawite while the mass of conscripts are Sunni , is also a concern . \nA Damascus based analyst , echoing many observers abroad , said Assad and his Alawite allies appeared bent on hanging to power at all costs : `` The regime has essentially vowed to break the country over the people 's heads , '' the analyst said . \n`` It will push the country over the cliff unless Syrian society resists its divisive tactics . \nSo the fate of Syria lies not in the hands of the regime , but in that of the people . '' \nAn activist who took part in an opposition conference in Turkey last week said he believed that widespread violence was a risk many were willing to take , however , to be rid of Assad . \n`` Even if there is ... a civil war or anything like that , people are determined to go all the way , to the end , regardless of the cost , '' he said . \n`` We want him out and we want to be free of this regime . \n`` The regime is pushing the country toward civil war and we are heading that way it seems . '' \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThat would be bad for the other Muslim sects , Kurds and the Christians . \nIt appears to me the desire to be free is greater than a desire to embrace a Sunni based religious dictatorship . \nIn the end , all of this might have to be settled by a civil war . \nIf that happens , the US needs to back the moderates in the country . \nOtherwise , there could be big trouble in the region . \nJournalists are supposed to be neutral . \nThe report reveals the reporter 's blatant bias . \nThis reporter has an agenda . \n`` Guns are widely available across Syria '' . \nSyrians would crack up if they heard such misinformation . \nTo get a pistol , you would have to know the right people , bribe VERY generously , and wait for months . \nSome might also be able to smuggle small pieces but that would be EXTREMELY difficult . \nPeople in Syria have no access to weapons whatsoever . \nEnraged by the massacre that occurred on June 4th in Jisr el-Shughour , Lieutenant Colonel Husain Harmoush , Division Command , the 11th Division , defected along with a number of other members of the military . \nThey refused to gun down unarmed protesters and stood up to the regime . \nGet your facts straight before you say that `` Guns are widely available ACROSS Syria '' like it was Yemen . \nI am sure you have a lot of Syrian contacts . \nPlease pose this question to them about the readily availability of guns in Syria and thy will laugh their heads off . \nBoth Assad and Gaddafi are brutal dictators who fire on their own people . \nWhy UN and NATO adopt double standards toward Syria and Libya ? \nThese cold-blooded leaders deserve bunker bombs . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe heavy security appeared to be effective . \n`` We have n't received any information about any protests there , '' said Enghebatu Togochog of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Centre , though he added difficult communications made it hard to get up-to-date information . \n`` Security is exceptionally tight . \nThe authorities appear to be sending text messages to people warning them not to leave their homes . '' \nUprisings across the Arab world have made Chinese authorities jittery about any sign of instability . \nIn a meeting on Monday that was chaired by Chinese President Hu Jintao , the Politburo , the nation 's top ruling body , said `` elements that can cause disharmony '' should be reduced by `` the largest degree . '' \n`` As the situation changes , our country 's concept of social management , institutional mechanisms , laws and policies ... are still unsuitable in many places , '' Xinhua reported the Politburo as saying . \n`` Resolving the problems in social management is urgent and requires long-term effort . '' \nSearches for the words `` Inner Mongolia '' on China 's most popular microblogging site , Weibo , appeared to have been blocked on Monday , returning the message : `` According to relevant laws , the search query can not be displayed . '' \nResentment of ethnic majority Han Chinese by ethnic Mongolians goes back decades . \nInner Mongolia was the first autonomous region set up by the Communist Party and was meant to serve as a model for Tibet and Xinjiang in offering a high degree of self-government . \nBut a flood of migration by Han Chinese in the years following the 1949 revolution has rapidly diluted the Mongolian population . \nEthnic Mongolian herders have complained that their traditional grazing lands have been ruined by mining and desertification , and that the government has tried to force them to settle in permanent houses . \nIn Ulan Bator , capital of the independent country of Mongolia , about 50 protesters gathered in support of their ethnic cousins in China . \nSome held banners calling for an end to `` oppression '' and justice for the herder killed by the truck . \nNicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch said from Hong Kong rising tension had the Party worried that instability could spread to other ethnic groups . \n`` The situation points to the wholesale failure of the Party 's policies towards ethnic minorities -- that they are alienating and disenfranchising each to the point that they are willing to protest even when they know the consequences can be severe , '' Bequelin said . \n"}

'' \n-LRB- High-tech -RRB- Bells and whistles are no use if you do n't have trusted , loyal and well-informed staff , '' said an industry executive who spoke recently at a closed door cyber seminar . \nMany experts say much more can be done to tighten security at the `` endpoint '' -- in other words , people -- rather than place excessive reliance on clever software , important as that is . \nSome experts see a need to carry out security vetting when hiring key staff , for example computer system administrators . \n`` Technology is only a part of the problem -- all systems are composed of people , processes and technology -- you only need to break one of the components to attack the system , '' said Steve Purser , a senior expert at the European Network and Information Security Agency , a European Union body . \nHe said there were no hard and fast rules about monitoring staff online because data differed in sensitivity and context . \n`` The important point is to communicate the rules to staff and to ensure that the rules are being followed , '' he said . \nThe need is urgent , not least because employers are worried recession may swell the ranks of staff in line for retrenchment who plan to take proprietary data with them out of the door . \nSome are queasy about the notion of intruding on employees ' online work . \nBut then , analysts note , hackers are doing exactly the same thing -- and imperiling jobs into the bargain . \n`` It 's the people side of the equation that is letting the bad guys through right now , '' Neil Fisher , Vice President of Global Security Solutions at Unisys Corp told Reuters . \nHe was referring to ` phishing ' attacks , a hacker ploy to obtain data such as passwords or bank details by posing as a legitimate institution . \nIn advanced `` spear-phishing '' campaigns hackers craft personalized e-mails , often using data available on social media websites , duping recipients into downloading attachments that launch malicious software that takes over their computers . \nSuch ploys are suspected in at least some recent prominent attacks , which have targeted entities such as the International Monetary Fund , Central Intelligence Agency , the U.S. Senate , and companies such as Citigroup and Lockheed Martin . \nMohan Koo , CEO of Dtex Systems -LRB- UK -RRB- , said most organizations tended to over-prioritize the risk of external threats , a tendency he said was prevalent in the financial sector . \n`` For years now investment banks have lived by the motto Know Your Customer ' today it 's more critical that they focus on Know Your Insider ' because that is where they have a weakness . '' \n`` The problem is that most organizations do n't monitor their insiders with a sufficient level of granularity to quantify the threat to their business . \nIf they did , the shock would be sufficient to spark a significant change in their approach . '' \nA March 28 study by computer security firm McAfee and U.S. government consulting company SAIC said the most significant threat reported by organizations when protecting information was data leaked accidentally or intentionally by employees . \nECONOMIC PAIN MAY RAISE RISK OF ABUSE The risk of malicious theft of data or intellectual property by insiders for private gain or to boost value to potential new employers may rise as Western economies struggle , analysts say . \nA 2011 survey of cyber crime by Verizon , the U.S. Secret Service and the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit noted concern among industry experts that financial strain would cause an increase in insider abuse , although evidence was sparse so far . \nAn 2010 Imperva cyber security company study of 1,026 people in several business districts in London showed that if rumors were circulating about possible redundancies , 37 percent of respondents said they would want to take information with them . \nTony Dyhouse , a security expert at Britain 's ICT Knowledge Transfer Network , told Reuters a lot of the insider threat was actually `` from people who are no longer inside . '' \n`` They 've left the company but they still have access credentials , they may still have site passes and computer access . \nAll too often people leave the company and their accounts are not closed down . \n`` People are aware of the value of data and they will try and keep things and send information home . \nThey actually take preemptive action , so ` now I am going to get my own back , or at least I am going to make sure I have the capability to do so ' .

'' \nSyrian authorities said on Thursday the army had begun to leave Deraa , but residents described a city still under siege . \n`` With our soul and blood , we will sacrifice for you , Deraa , '' chanted 20,000 protesters in nearby Jassem on Friday . \nThousands more converged on the town of Tafas , 12 km -LRB- 8 miles -RRB- northwest of Deraa , which remains encircled by tanks , carrying placards with the word `` leave . '' \nAid workers from the Red Cross and Red Crescent delivered their first emergency relief supplies to Deraa on Thursday , bringing drinking water , food and first aid materials . \nThey had no immediate information on casualties in the city . \nHuman Rights Watch cited figures from Syrian rights groups saying 350 people had been killed there . \nIt urged authorities on Friday to `` lift the siege '' on the city and to halt what it called a nationwide campaign of arbitrary arrests . \n"}

'' \nA graduate of Sandhurst military academy , Nasser , 23 , has so far kept out of the spotlight and is known for participating in endurance equestrian events . \nHe wed the daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum in 2009 . \nAt stake are reforms Sheikh Salman initiated to open up the economy to international and local investors , which in turn were aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil income and enable the private sector to create jobs for Bahrain 's youth . \n`` Bahrain does not have the luxury to be hesitant on reform , '' said John Sfakianakis , chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi . \n`` It now competes with business-friendly financial centres in Qatar , Abu Dhabi , and of course Dubai . \nIf businesses leave they will be received elsewhere , '' he said . \nWith government finances in a precarious position , Bahrain , a small oil producer , can not afford to plough more funds into ailing state companies such as national carrier Gulf Air GULF . \nUL , which Sheikh Salman wanted to privatise in the long-term . \nThe crown prince had slowly wrestled control over business regulations from the hands of Bahrain 's government bureaucracy headed by his long-time rival , Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa , an uncle of the king who has governed the Gulf island kingdom since its independence four decades ago . \nOne example of the rivalry between the two is Bahrain 's airport that was effectively run by the ministry of transportation , previously headed by a son of Sheikh Khalifa . \nIt was transferred to private sector management in 2010 after years of resistance by the government administration . \nTransportation was a cornerstone of the crown prince 's strategy to turn Bahrain into a business hub hosting the regional headquarters of multinationals . \nAfter hardliners said that Iran and Shi'ite movement Hezbollah sponsored the unrest , they forced Gulf Air to suspend its flights to destinations in Iran , Lebanon and Iraq . \n`` International investors will take note of these things , -LRB- Sheikh Salman -RRB- was seen as an economic reformer . \nNow they will ask what is happening to the forces who pushed for privatisation and economic reforms , '' said Sfakianakis . \nSheikh Nasser now appears in favor , and in recent weeks he has represented the royal family at social occasions and led a campaign for loyalists to demonstrate their allegiance to the royal family . \n`` It is definitely noticeable that Sheikh Nasser has become more prominent , '' said Jane Kinninmont , an analyst at British thinktank Chatham House . \n`` This puts him up there with the senior people , which has not been seen before .

'' \nA Damascus-based analyst , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue in Syria , said Assad had missed another opportunity to stake out a credible way forward . \n`` He failed to address the two fundamental issues that have come to shape the crisis in the eyes of many Syrians , namely the dismal behavior of the security services and his own lack of decisive leadership , '' he said . \nAssad said more than 100 people `` from different sections of society '' would be invited within days to consultative meetings to discuss the framework of a national dialogue promised by the government more than a month ago . \nOpposition figures have yet to formulate a response to any invitation to join the meetings , but several have said that no dialogue can succeed while the security crackdown continues and thousands of political detainees remain in jail . \nEven were they to attend , it is not clear what impact that would have on street protests which initially called for greater freedom but which for weeks now have demanded Assad 's overthrow . \n`` It is hard to see a simple pathway to implementing this reform program , '' said Ayham Kamel , an analyst at Eurasia Group . \n`` Military force will still be utilised to confront at least part of the opposition . \nThis would make it hard for many opposition figures to enter a negotiation process with the regime or join the national dialogue committee . '' \nKamel said the speech was likely to polarize Syrian society , with Assad loyalists seeing it as proof that the president was ready for tangible concessions , while opponents dismiss it as inconsequential . \nThose tensions were visible in several Syrian cities on Tuesday , as tens of thousands of Assad supporters rallied in cities across the country , leading to clashes with protesters in which activists said security forces shot dead seven people . \n`` There are fractures that run through Syrian society , and the regime is seeking to play on those to cement its hold on power , '' Barnes-Dacey said . \n`` If this conflict becomes militarized there is a real prospect of some form of civil war . '' \nHe said that while security forces could help Assad maintain his grip in the short term , the deadlock with protesters and the deteriorating economy -- hit by a collapse in tourism and a likely halt in foreign investment -- meant his prospects over the coming months and years were less certain . \nAssad himself acknowledged that the most dangerous prospect was `` the weakness or collapse of the Syrian economy , '' urging people to work together to `` restore confidence '' in the economy . \n`` The economics as much as the politics mean it will be very hard for Assad to survive , '' Barnes-Dacy said . \nOne activist said he hoped for a more immediate result , noting that Assad had now made three speeches since the protests broke out -- the same number as the Tunisian and Egyptian leaders before they were ousted . \n`` Just as Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak fell after the third speech we are hopeful this will be the speech that will bring his downfall , '' said Abdullah Aba Zaid , a civic leader from the southern city of Deraa where the uprising erupted in March . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "229", "time": "2011-06-26", "text": "ANKARA | Sun Jun 26 , 2011 9:11 am EDT ANKARA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey faces a growing danger Syrian economic and social disruption could spill onto its soil , with some fearing an influx of refugees could draw its troops into border operations uncomfortably close to Syrian forces . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad 's crackdown on opposition has pushed once-warm ties with Syria close to breaking point . \nAssad 's increasingly bloody repression of protests has driven 12,000 Syrian refugees to move north and take shelter in camps in Turkey , while Syrian troops move up to seal the area . \nAnkara has sharpened its rhetoric against Damascus -- publicly nudging Assad to pass reforms and calling his crackdown `` savagery '' -- but analysts say Turkey is still holding out hope for a change of heart in Assad . \nTurkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Friday a speech by Assad contained `` positive elements in it as signals of reform , '' but said it was important that action followed . \n`` The Turks seem to be quite worried about a lack of alternatives to a stable regime other than a cruel tyrannical succession , '' said a Western diplomat with knowledge of the Turkish perspective . \n`` Their last best hope -- although they are not naive -- is that somehow Assad , out of desperation to save his own skin , will undertake meaningful reforms . '' \nSyria , an ally of Iran , sits at the heart of numerous conflicts in the Middle East . \nAn unstable Syria would have repercussions for Turkey , which also borders Iran and Iraq . \n`` The fear of the unknown is a major factor , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . \n`` AK is very conservative . \nIt prefers to deal with the devil it knows and Assad is the devil it knows , '' Jenkins said , referring to Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan 's ruling AK Party , which has improved ties with Syria and other Muslim countries . \nBut Turkey could decide to ditch Assad should Syria descend into a civil war between religious and ethnic groupings . \nThough non-Arab , Turkey 's demographics have similarities with Syria 's . \nBoth have a Sunni majority with Kurdish and Alawite minorities , although Assad 's ruling family are Alawites . \n`` The strategic , political dimension says that the stability of Syria is vital for the fragile stability of the Middle East , '' Murat Yetkin , editor of the Hurriyet daily , wrote recently . \n`` But that does n't mean that the current regime will be supported at any cost , because the Baath rule can not produce stability anymore , as it insists on the current policies . '' \nWith refugees pouring across the border , media have reported that Turkish political and military leaders are considering setting up a buffer zone inside Syria in case the number of refugees increases sharply . \nOfficials say they are not aware of such plans . \nTurkey 's 2nd Army Commander visited the Guvecci border post this week to take stock of Syrian troop deployments near the border and to see the situation of the refugees for himself . \nTurkey was caught off guard when 500,000 people flooded across the border from Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War , many of them staying for some time after the war . \nThe years that followed saw small contingents of Turkish troops policing what was an effective ` buffer zone ' in the north of Iraq . \nHaving almost gone to war in the late 1990s because of Turkish Kurdish militants using Syria as a sanctuary , Damascus would not welcome the prospect of Turkish boots on Syrian soil . \nAnkara still faces an insurrection by Kurdish militants seeking their own state in the south-east . \nTurkey is eager to see borders with Syria , Iran and Iraq that , while open to commerce , are well sealed against rebel infiltration . \nJenkins said creating a buffer zone in Syria would carry risks given concerns of Turkish `` neo-Ottoman '' foreign ambitions in some Arab countries , but said Ankara might be forced to it in the case of a mass influx of refugees . \n`` If we start seeing a spillover that upsets the internal demographic dynamics of Turkey a buffer zone would be possible . \nThe Kurds are the elephant in the room here , '' he said . \nWhile Turkey has failed to use its economic leverage to force a change in Damascus -- Turkey is Syria 's largest trading partner -- it is maneuvering to adapt to any fallout . \nA few months ago , Turkey and Syria were holding joint cabinet meetings and military exercises and abolished visa requirements . \nEarlier this month , Turkey hosted a conference of Syrian opposition figures in the city of Antalya , and members of the outlawed Syrian Muslim Brotherhood operate out of Turkey . \nMeanwhile , there have also been early signs of a thaw in frosty relations between Turkey and Israel , Syria 's enemy . \nTurkish-Israeli ties deteriorated sharply when Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish-backed flotilla bound for Gaza last year , killing nine Turkish activists . \n`` The policy of warming up to Syria has collapsed , but rather than Turkey reaching a point in which its patience with Assad will snap we will see Turkey finding new margins of maneuver to whatever situation emerges , '' said Semih Idiz , a foreign policy expert for Milliyet daily . \nThe Syrian crisis has also pushed Ankara and Washington into closer cooperation after falling out of step over Iran . \nErdogan , who once vacationed together with Assad , and U.S. President Barack Obama have discussed Syria twice by phone recently and share a need for Damascus to implement reforms . \nAssad 's repression has triggered a gradual escalation of U.S. and European Union economic sanctions against Syrian leaders , but Turks do n't agree on sanctions . \n`` Turks hate sanctions . \nTurks suffered greatly under generations of sanctions in Saddam 's Iraq and now with Iran . \nThe last thing Turkey wants is a third country on its eastern border under international sanctions , '' the Western diplomat said . \n`` They likely would not hesitate to point out to Assad the examples of Saddam and Iran , if he persists in oppressing his own people and defying world opinion .

'' \nArab foreign ministers will review the plan on Saturday , but Syrian opponents of Assad show no surprise at its fate . \n`` I do n't think anyone in his right mind was expecting Assad to pull his troops out of the streets and allow peaceful protests , '' Walid al-Bunni , a lawyer and often-jailed dissident who left Syria for Paris two weeks ago , told Reuters . \n`` Lack of even a threat of international intervention is viewed by the authorities as a license to kill , '' he said . \nEvident Arab impotence to deflect Assad from the path he has chosen for survival against what he calls Islamist militants and foreign-backed gangs throws the ball back to Western powers whose own rebukes the Syrian leader has ignored or denounced . \nAssad has played on fears that without him Syria could slide into civil war , Islamic militancy or Iraq-style sectarian carnage , causing what he has called a regional `` earthquake . '' \nNadim Shehadi , of London 's Chatham House think-tank , said Assad had already lost power , in the sense of legitimacy , but argued that the outside world had effectively propped him up with unheeded calls for reform and dialogue . \n`` The people who are protesting in Syria seem to have crossed the barrier of fear , but the international community has n't . '' \nMany Syrians have defied a feared security apparatus to keep up demands for change , despite bloodshed which the United Nations says has cost more than 3,500 lives -- as well as those of 1,100 soldiers and police , according to the government . \nArmed with a U.N. Security Council mandate to protect civilians , Western powers lent air support to Libyan rebels who toppled Muammar Gaddafi , but have disavowed any intent to repeat the feat in Syria , in a far trickier area of the Middle East . \nRussia and China , stung by the robust Western reading of the U.N. resolution on Libya , oppose even U.N. criticism of Syria , whose uprising was inspired by others in the Arab world . \nThe Arab League , which had suspended Libya 's membership and backed a no-fly zone there , has treated Syria more leniently . \nAssad 's own doom-laden warnings have reinforced the fears of Syria 's neighbors -- Israel , Lebanon , Iraq , Jordan and Turkey -- about the possibly seismic consequences of a power shift in a nation on the faultlines of several Middle Eastern conflicts . \nInstability in Syria , Iran 's only Arab ally , could spread to Lebanon or Iraq , which have volatile sectarian divides . \nIsrael , long used to a calm border with Syria , frets that Assad 's fall could herald less predictable rulers . \nSyrian refugees have already spilled into Lebanon and Turkey , which is also wary of any revived Syrian support for rebel Kurds in its southeast . \nAssad still retains substantial support from his own Alawite minority , part of the business elite in Damascus and Aleppo , Christians and others who fear that Islamist radicals might come to the fore , and , crucially , army and security force commanders . \n`` Until now there are segments of the Syrian population on the sidelines , afraid for their lives if they go out in the streets , or betting that Assad will survive , '' said a leading dissident in Syria , who asked not to be named . \nHe said the Arab League had embarrassed Assad with a plan he could not implement without inviting huge street protests . \nIt could now suspend Syria and refer it to the United Nations , putting pressure on Russia and China to alter their stance . \nAn Arab League source said a ministerial committee might return to Damascus with a reprimand and perhaps a new deadline for compliance , or dispatch Arab observers to identify violators of the deal . \nSterner action , such as suspending Syria from the League or blaming it for the violence , was unlikely immediately . \nWaheed Abdel Maguid , at Cairo 's al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies , said the League was hamstrung by its own rifts , with Algeria , Lebanon and Yemen hostile to penalizing Syria , and Iraq , Sudan and Mauritania hesitant . \n`` This puts the League in an awkward situation , '' he said . \n`` It holds meetings but is unable to act . '' \nThe big powers seem just as indecisive and divided , although seemingly agreed on ruling out military intervention . \n`` In these conditions , it is not unlikely that Turkey will take some kind of action , with implicit support from Washington and major European capitals , '' Jouejati said . \nBut Turkey , now a bitter critic of its former friend , has yet to impose sanctions promised weeks ago , or to send clear signals on the idea of a safe haven or no-fly zone in Syria . \n`` We hope there will be no need for these type of measures , but of course humanitarian issues are important , '' Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told the Financial Times this month . \nWestern countries , preoccupied with global economic woes , have sharpened their rhetoric , but otherwise seem at a loss . \n`` Those leaders trying to hold back the future at the point of a gun should know their days are numbered , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Monday , referring to Syria , while acknowledging the difficulty of any Libya-style `` liberation . '' \nThe same day , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Syria 's behavior after the Arab peace plan was `` absolutely unacceptable '' and that it `` could no longer be trusted . '' \nBut , like his British counterpart William Hague who deplored Syria 's policy , he offered no blueprint for action . \nThe West has urged Assad 's foes to form a united , coherent front , but Chatham House 's Shehadi said this was absurd , given the diversity of opinion lurking beneath years of repression . \n`` This is not really an opposition , this is the whole of Syrian society , '' he said . \nWithout decisive outside moves or the growth of a more powerful insurgency at home , Assad could survive for years , said Joshua Landis , a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma . \n`` Today , the opposition remains weak and the Syrian military has the upper hand . \nThat could change if the opposition begins to construct a real insurgency , if Turkey goes to war against Syria by supporting some sort of insurgency , or if a foreign intervention is launched , such as happened in Libya , '' he said . \n`` None of these possibilities is on the horizon , '' Landis added , arguing that small guerrilla groups might begin to proliferate and harass the Syrian military and state . \n`` If they gain traction , foreign funding and arms , they could transform into a real insurgency over time .

'' \nFree trade is expected to top the agenda of the November 12-13 summit in Honolulu , where leaders will also discuss a green growth initiative , which would cut tariffs on environmental goods and services such as solar panels and wind turbines . \nIn an effort to appease farmers , Noda 's government last month unveiled a plan to strengthen Japan 's agriculture by consolidating typically tiny patches of farmland into bigger farms that can withstand foreign competition . \n`` If we give the reform enough time , Japan 's agriculture can be stronger . \nA growing number of wealthy consumers in Asia will be buying Japan 's high-quality farm products , '' said Hisashi Yamada , chief economist at Japan Research Institute . \nThe TPP was launched in 2006 as an free trade initiative among Singapore , New Zealand , Chile and Brunei . \nIn addition to the four original members and the United States , talks have also been joined by Australia , Malaysia , Peru and Vietnam . \nIf Tokyo joined the pact , Japan and the United States would account for more than 90 percent of the total GDP within the TPP countries . \n`` Some people may say this is going to be a U.S.-Japan free trade agreement in disguise . \nBut Southeast Asian markets are the ones that will expand rapidly as we go forward , '' National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies ' Masuyama said . \nWith its population shrinking and greying , Japan needs to look overseas for growth . \nBut its society is split down the middle on the trade pact . \nA survey by Kyodo news agency earlier this month showed 38 percent backed Japan 's participation in the pact , while 36 percent opposed it . \nIts proponents say it is crucial to join the talks as soon as possible , so that Japan can better protect its interest , for example by seeking an exemption for rice , Japan 's staple diet . \n`` When it comes to rice , Japan can not easily open up its market 100 percent . \nJust like the United States is aiming to make sugar an exception , there is a good chance that Japan can make rice an exception , '' said Tomoaki Iwai , professor at Nihon University . \nJapan currently imposes 778 percent tariff on imported rice to protect typically small-scaled domestic rice farmers . \n-LRB- Editing by Tomasz Janowski and Jonathan Thatcher -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe Dalai Lama , fresh from a visit to Japan , arrived in the Mongolian capital on Monday for a three-day lecture tour at a invitation of a Buddhist group . \nHe denies being a separatist , saying he only seeks autonomy for his homeland . \nChoijamtsa , the head monk at Mongolia 's Gandan-Tegchilen monastery , which is organising the visit , told Reuters that organisers remained determined to go ahead with the planned lectures . \n`` This is Mongolian territory and Mongolian property and we are going to do it even if others oppose it , '' he said . \nThe Dalai Lama 's visit comes amid growing concern about China 's hardline rule in ethnically Tibetan parts of the country . \nAt least 11 Tibetans have set themselves ablaze this year in the western Chinese province of Sichuan in protest against government controls on their religion and culture . \nBeijing has blamed the Dalai Lama for encouraging unrest , but the spiritual leader said the situation was caused by Chinese policies in the region , which amounted to `` cultural genocide . \nMongolia , landlocked between China in the south and Russia in the north , has seen a rapid revival of Tibetan Buddhism since the collapse of the Soviet-backed Communist government in 1990 , and the Dalai Lama is recognized as one of the country 's spiritual leaders . \nChina has been accused by human rights groups of using its growing economic clout to pressure trading partners into refusing visits by the Dalai Lama . \nHis plans to visit South Africa earlier this year were canceled amid accusations that the government in Cape Town had refused to process his visa . \nMongolia won its political independence from China in 1912 , but Beijing did not recognize its sovereignty until 1946 , and many in Mongolia are concerned about Beijing 's growing economic hegemony . \nMongolia 's booming , mining-dependent economy is almost completely reliant on its southern neighbor , with 90 percent of its exports going to China in the first half of this year . \nDuring the Dalai Lama 's previous tour of Mongolia in 2002 , China retaliated by closing the border rail crossing for two days , leaving 500 passengers stranded and severing one of the country 's few links with the outside world . \nMining companies based near the Chinese border said they were not aware of any disruptions to border transport so far . \n"}

'' \nMainstream opposition groups such as Waad seek a more representative parliament with legislative powers that are not weakened by an upper Shura council appointed by the king . \nThe government has said all types of political , economic and social reform can be discussed but the opposition is suspicious that the wide variety of issues will diminish the chances of agreeing on real democratisation . \nParticipants in the dialogue will send their proposals for approval to Bahrain 's ruling family at the end of the talks . \nWaad , a secular leftist party run by Sunnis and Shi'ites alike , was the worst-hit during unrest this year . \nBoth of its offices were set ablaze and the government banned its operations , a decision it reversed just last week . \nWaad members believe their non-sectarian voice made them a target by hardliners in support of the government , who they accuse of stoking sectarian tensions in the Gulf island kingdom . \n`` The government can not gain victory over people by sewing sectarian divisions . \nSectarianism could destroy us . \nThe wars in Lebanon and Iraq have shown us that , '' Mousawi said as he examined the charred walls of Waad 's offices in Manama . \nMousawi has led Waad in the stead of Ibrahim Sharif , the party 's Sunni , secular leader who was sentenced to five years in prison last week on charges of assisting a `` foreign terrorist group '' in a coup plot . \nEight prominent hardline Shi'ite opposition leaders received life in prison . \nBahrain , which crushed demonstrations calling for democracy in March , accuses the opposition of a sectarian agenda and backing by Shi'ite power Iran , charges that Shi'ite groups deny and Waad said was contradicted by its secular approach . \nSome hardline parties had called for abolition of the monarchy , but Waad and its Shi'ite political ally Wefaq , the opposition 's largest bloc , stuck to calls for democratic reforms to Bahrain 's constitutional monarchy . \nThat has not stopped government loyalists from accusing Wefaq of taking direct orders from Iran and Waad of accepting such plans for political gain , accusations both groups deny . \nOpposition groups say that to have its ban lifted , Waad was coerced into accepting the national dialogue and apologising publicly for criticising Bahrain 's invitation of Saudi and United Arab Emirates troops to help it crack down on protests . \n`` We paid the price with certain concessions in a statement last week in order to reopen , '' Mousawi said . \n`` But we felt it was important to do it so we could get back to work . '' \nAuthorities last week handed back the keys to Waad 's burnt-out headquarters , which the party is now renovating . \nMousawi warned Waad was ready to withdraw if democratic reforms to the monarchy were not addressed . \nOpposition parties complain the dialogue dilutes their voice -- they have only 35 of 300 seats at the talks . \n`` This was not the dialogue we imagined , we wanted direct talks between the government and the opposition , '' said Mousawi . \n`` If there is no serious move on political reform , we will walk . '' \nMousawi criticised Bahraini officials ' arguments that the opposition must be patient as reforms are implemented gradually in Bahrain , which they say is new to democratic reforms compared to established constitutional monarchies in Britain or Denmark . \nMousawi said : `` The people are ready for democracy now ...

'' \nKarzai has also been pushing for reconciliation with the Taliban and for the first time in the 10-year war , Pakistan , Afghanistan and the United States all share - in theory at least -- a commitment to seek a political settlement . \nBut deep distrust remains , both between the United States and Pakistan and between Afghanistan and Pakistan . \nPakistan has so far been excluded from Washington 's early contacts with the Taliban , Grossman told a news conference in Kabul . \n`` Up to now , the government of Pakistan has not been involved in that particular process at all , as yet . '' \nKabul accuses Pakistan of continuing to support the Afghan Taliban , whom it openly backed when they were in power from 1996 to 2001 , to maintain its influence in Afghanistan . \nIt also says Islamabad is trying to manipulate peace talks to its advantage , to the point of sabotaging them if they do not go in the direction it wants . \n`` We expect practical steps from Pakistan in the weeks and months ahead to help sustain the peace process , '' a senior Afghan government official said . \n`` The ball is in Pakistan 's court . '' \nMujhda , the political analyst , echoed widespread distrust in Kabul of Pakistan 's intentions . \n`` In each of these meetings the reconciliation issue is raised , promises are made and then the countries go home and nothing is done , '' he said . \n`` Pakistan has so far opposed attempts by the U.S. to talk to the Taliban . '' \nThe United States is also reluctant to include all insurgents in a political settlement , limiting its talks to the Afghan Taliban led by Mullah Mohammed Omar , but excluding the Haqqani network - the most active group in eastern Afghanistan . \nIt is pushing Pakistan to expand its military operations in its tribal areas to target militants who use them as a base to fight in Afghanistan . \nPakistan says its overstretched military will give priority to fighting militants who are killing its own people . \nWith the Taliban talks still at a preliminary stage , and vulnerable to ethnic and regional rivalries which could plunge Afghanistan deeper into civil war as U.S. troops withdraw , the cross-border shelling has added another complication to a fragile situation . \nThe Afghan government said on Sunday that `` it strongly condemned the firing of 470 rockets over the past three weeks from the Pakistan side of the border in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangahar provinces . '' \nPresident Hamid Karzai expressed his deep concern , it said , and asked Pakistan to immediately stop firing into Afghanistan . \nA spokesman for Karzai said on Monday Pakistan 's ambassador to Kabul had been summoned over the issue , though adding : `` we are sure it can be resolved . '' \nPakistan army spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said no rounds had been intentionally fired into Afghanistan . \nIn the last month , there had been five major attacks from the Afghan side of the border , in which 55 men in the Pakistani security forces had been killed and 80 wounded . \n`` The fleeing militants were engaged by the security forces and a few accidental rounds going across can not be ruled out , '' he said . \nPakistan says militants , including Pakistani Taliban commanders , have taken refuge on the Afghan side after it launched military operations to drive them out of its Federally Administered Tribal Areas . \nIt was angered by a U.S. decision to thin out its troops in eastern Afghanistan , including the Korengal valley in Kunar province , when Washington decided to concentrate on population centres in southern Afghanistan , the Taliban heartland . \n`` For quite some time we have been highlighting that there are safe havens across the border , '' Abbas said . \n`` Something should be done about these . '' \nBefore the killing of bin Laden , the United States had been talking about improving coordination of military operations on both sides of the border so that they could work with , rather than against , each other , in fighting insurgents . \nThat cooperation may have deteriorated in the breakdown of trust which followed the unilateral U.S. raid to get bin Laden , perhaps explaining the escalation in cross-border shelling . \nIt is impossible to verify independently exactly what is happening on the remote mountainous border . \n"}

{"id": "50", "time": "2011-06-29", "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Jun 29 , 2011 11:04 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's opposition , weakened by half a century of oppression under the Baath party , is united in demanding change but divided over how to achieve it . \nSome believe the street protests which erupted three months ago , the most serious challenge to the 11-year rule of President Bashar al-Assad , can overthrow him and bring democracy and freedom to the Arab country . \nOthers insist that without dialogue with the authorities to agree on reforms and a period of transition away from autocracy , the country faces a dark future , including possible civil war . \nDivisions came to the fore this week when the leadership granted a rare public platform to the opposition in Damascus . \nIt let them articulate demands but also exposed a rift between those taking part and other activists , many in exile , who called it pointless while security forces were still crushing protests . \n`` We are definitely with the dialogue . \nWe do not think there is anything else capable of solving the crisis in Syria , '' said Fateh Jamous , who spent some 19 years in jail as a dissident . \n`` But before the dialogue we need some practical moves on the ground ... so that the side which is holding talks does not look like it is doing that against the popular movement , '' he added , speaking by phone from Damascus . \nOther opposition figures believe Assad has already squandered opportunities for reform , saying it is too late for the national dialogue he has promised and he must leave now . \n`` This regime has lost its legitimacy . \nI do not see any reason in talking to it . \nHe must go and we will choose our way after him . \nHe must go first , '' said one secular activist in Damascus , who asked not to be named for his own safety . \nEven many who believe in dialogue say they can not talk with the authorities while the crackdown on protesters continues . \n`` What we want is a democratic change in the structure of the regime , which means changes in laws , institutions -- all the issues of the past 40 to 50 years to be dealt with , '' said Jamous , a senior official of Syria 's Communist Labor party . \nLouay Hussein , a writer who was detained during this year 's protests and took part in the opposition conference in Damascus on Monday which called for democratic change , said authorities must prepare the right atmosphere for talks . \n`` Before any dialogue all detainees must be released , the crackdown must end , and the opposition must be allowed a voice in state media , '' he said . \nWestern governments have condemned Assad 's violence against protesters , but their practical response has so far been limited to sanctions against top officials , a far cry from the military intervention against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya . \nAssad 's response to the protests has also included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds , lifting a draconian state of emergency , freeing hundreds of prisoners and calling for a national dialogue . \nProtests , triggered by anger and frustration at corruption , poverty and lack of freedoms , have been mainly peaceful , though rights groups say the death toll among protesters is over 1,300 and that 12,000 people have been detained . \nAssad 's adviser Bouthaina Shaaban said on Tuesday that 500 soldiers and police had been killed . \nActivists say that at least some of the dead soldiers were killed by their own superiors for disobeying orders to stop protests . \nSyria has imposed restrictions on media , including expelling journalists , making it hard to verify accounts of violence . \nAlthough the secular opposition shared a common goal of democracy and opposes foreign intervention , years of oppression under Assad 's late father , Hafez al-Assad , have fragmented this loose grouping of liberals , Arab nationalists and Kurds . \nA high-profile alliance which in 2005 produced what it called the Damascus Declaration calling for peaceful reform has done little as a group since this year 's protests broke out . \nOperating largely separately has been the banned Islamist Muslim Brotherhood . \nDominated by exiles since the elder Assad crushed an armed revolt by the group in the city of Hama in 1982 , it still has potential to be a major force among those in the Sunni majority keen to throw off domination by Assad 's minority Alawite sect . \nMembership is still punishable by death . \nMost veteran opposition figures have spent years in prison . \nMany have been jailed several times . \nIn the past year , Syria 's intelligence agents have worked tirelessly to divide the various opposition groups , playing on their rivalries to plant seeds of doubt among them and leaving a legacy of suspicion still evident in their responses to an uprising that seems to have started as a spontaneous reaction among ordinary people to the overthrow of other Arab leaders . \nWhen the Syrian protests erupted in March , triggered by local grievances in the southern city of Deraa , the disparate opposition failed to take a lead , leaving the way open for a new form of activism , inspired by Egypt 's successful revolution . \nYoung people set up local coordination committees which were active on the streets , made contact with media organizations banned from reporting in Syria and made use of mobile phone footage and social media to promote their cause . \n`` The street opposition was born and is now playing the main role in calling for the change , '' said Aref Dalila , a prominent economist and activist who spent years in prison . \nHe dropped out of this week 's meeting in Damascus at the last minute . \nThe conference won a guarded welcome from Assad 's toughest critics in Western governments , but another prominent opposition figure in Damascus who refused to take part said it might have helped polish the authorities ' image and harmed their opponents . \n`` We feel it might have been used ... to minimize the extent of opposition and to suggest it was limited only to those who came to the meeting , '' said the man , another formerly jailed dissident . \nDespite three months of street demonstrations , in which tens of thousands have braved violence to challenge Assad 's rule , most of the 22 million Syrians have stayed on the sidelines and the main cities of Damascus and Aleppo have seen fewer protests . \nWhile Assad 's promise of dialogue is unlikely to sway the committed protesters it might send a positive signal to the `` silent majority '' which has not taken to the streets , either from fear of repression or concern about chaos if Assad goes . \nFayez Sara , a liberal writer who attended the meeting in Damascus , said it had been an important achievement which helped bring different views together . \nHe hoped it could be repeated in the provinces : '' -LRB- It was a -RRB- breakthrough in the work of the opposition , which has been deprived of meeting and organizing events for the past 50 years , '' said Sara . \nIt was not the first time this year an opposition conference has been met with skepticism . \nWhen a group of activists and opposition parties met in Turkey last month critics among their fellow Syrian dissidents described it as an attempt to encourage foreign powers to intervene in their country . \nThat exposed another fault line in opposition ranks , between activists in exile who have been lobbying the international community to make a stand against Assad , and those still in the country who mostly insist that Syrians solve their own problems . \n`` The opposition outside does not represent us at all . \nWe are against any external intervention , because we believe it will only be motivated by interests and political forces which have a different view from those within the nation , '' said Jamous . \nSome activists who favor dialogue with Assad said they have come under pressure from others who question their loyalties . \n`` Some are saying ... ` you are doing the authorities a favor ' and ` it is a betrayal of the blood the people have shed in the streets ' , '' said one man in Damascus , who said he got angry messages on Facebook which all but called him a traitor . \n`` It is nonsense . \nIn order to save the blood of the people we should talk , '' he said . \n`` The sense of responsibility is still weak among many opposition groups . \nSome fear the intimidation , and they are doing nothing because they fear that this or that person will say something bad about them . '' \nHis views were echoed by several activists across Syria . \nMany stressed the country 's potentially volatile religious and ethnic mix as a powerful reason for promoting dialogue , to reduce the risk of violence from any sudden shift in power . \nAnalysts say that communities of Sunni Muslim Arabs -- by far the biggest group -- Kurds , Alawites and Christians , could slip into civil war as Assad increasingly relies on his fellow Alawites , both regular and militia forces , to hold on to power . \n`` I think now the crisis is heading toward a dangerous road and I hope that it will averted , '' Jamous said . \n`` All sides should make compromises : the regime , which is responsible for what is happening , and the opposition and those elements on the street which have called for the overthrow of the regime without thinking of the alternative and how to fill the vacuum . \n`` We want a transitional period during which safe and transparent elections take place .

'' \nThe announcement on state television that he is taking a lesser business role and moving into charity work will be no doubt be widely seen as aimed at helping the ruling family survive the turmoil -- even though campaigners scoffed at the move . \nA close friend and confidant of Assad , Makhkouf controls companies with outright monopolies or semi monopolies in duty free , airlines , telecoms , real estate , oil , construction and import businesses . \nAref Dalila , a leading economist , was jailed for eight years after he criticized the state for awarding a cellphone contract to Makhlouf that created Syriatel , the country 's largest mobile phone operator . \nThe tycoon , who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2008 for what Washington calls public corruption and was put under EU sanctions last month , has repeatedly said he is a legitimate businessman whose firms provide jobs for thousands of Syrians . \nMakhlouf belongs to Assad 's Alawite minority sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , which rose to dominate political system in majority Sunni Syria after controlling the army following a coup that brought the Baath Party to power in a 1963 . \nAlawites influence have spread to business , undermining a Sunni merchant establishment that had traditionally dominated commerce -- although Makhlouf sought to placate Sunnis by bringing them into a holding company he set up five years ago . \nHe is seen by many protesters as a front for more powerful family members , including Assad himself . \nHe also began taking a more political role , appearing on television to promote ties with Turkey and participating in meetings with Iraqi officials to improve relations , diplomats in the Syrian capital said . \nHis father Mohammad , a brother of Assad 's mother Anissa , also amassed a fortune under the rule of Assad 's father , the late Hafez al-Assad , and still plays a major role in managing the Makhlouf fortune , businessmen and diplomats say . \nBefore the uprising , Makhlouf had been changing the structure of the his companies by inviting Syrian and gulf shareholders , they added . \n`` Makhlouf has been trying to improve his image and portray himself as a regional businessman , '' one of the sources said . \nA leading opposition figure dismissed the move to charity as a cosmetic attempt to placate a public angry at the widespread corruption he said Makhlouf epitomized and doubted Makhlouf would lose his position as one of the country 's power elite . \n`` The news that Makhlouf will be donating to the Syrian people money he obtained by corruption and from monopolies granted to him because of his family links is comic , '' Walid al-Bunni told Reuters by phone from Damascus . \n`` The announcement would have had some credibility if Makhlouf had said he returned the billions of dollars he had amassed to the treasury . \nThe Syrian people may then think of forgiving him . '' \nOne businessman said that Makhlouf 's rise began with the death of Assad 's brother Basil in car accident in the 1990s . \nThe death of Basil , who was being groomed to succeed his father , brought in Bashar to politics . \n`` The difference between Bashar and Basil is that Basil was not under the influence of his cousins , '' the businessman said . \nMakhlouf told the New York Times in an interview last month that Syria 's ruling family will fight protesters `` to the end '' and hinted that Israel 's stability could be threatened if Assad was toppled . \nIn a rare public statement , Syrian authorities said that Makhlouf was a private citizen and that his views did not represent the Syrian state . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nLook at the massacre they are carrying out in Tibby you call that a revolution man you call that an operation for the people ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe breakaway military accused Saleh of starting a civil war and vowed that he and his entourage would be brought to justice . \nMohammed al-Surmi , a doctor at a Sanaa hospital , said two dead and 17 wounded were brought in . \nThe Defense Ministry website said one officer and one civilian were killed , and 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting with tribesmen . \nFull casualty figures were not immediately available due to the intensity of the fighting . \n`` Three different dynamics are playing out at the same time , '' said Ginny Hill , who runs the Yemen Forum at the influential Chatham House think-tank in London . \nThe newest element is the street revolution while the power struggle among the elites and fragmentation of the Arabian Peninsula country have been playing out for some time , she said . \n`` Saleh 's departure could be seen as the beginning of a contested and potentially lengthy process , '' she said . \nSaleh 's forces fired on hundreds of protesters in Taiz , about 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of the capital , who were trying to gather at the focal point of rallies dubbed `` Freedom Square , '' witnesses and a Reuters cameraman in the city said . \nAt least three people were killed and scores wounded in the latest fighting there , medical sources said . \nU.N. 's Pillay denounced the killings in Taiz where troops used bulldozers and bullets to crack down on protesters . \n`` Such reprehensible acts of violence and indiscriminate attacks on unarmed civilians by armed security officers must stop immediately , '' Pillay said in an Internet posting . \nFrench Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero condemned the attacks in Taiz . \nHe also said there was no news on three French aid workers who disappeared in southern Yemen on Saturday . \nParis believes they were kidnapped . \nFurther south , government troops and locals have been trying to oust al Qaeda and Islamist militants from Zinjibar after they seized the town of 20,000 at the weekend . \nResidents said bodies were strewn on the streets , the national bank building was burned and explosions rocked the city . \nMost of the inhabitants have fled . \n`` Explosions lit the sky , '' one resident said . \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of attacks by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , are worried that a spreading state of anarchy is emboldening the group . \nOpposition leaders have accused Saleh of deliberately allowing Zinjibar , located near a sea lane where about 3 million barrels of oil pass daily , to fall to al Qaeda to try to show how chaotic Yemen would be without him . \nAt least 320 people have been killed since protests started about four months ago , inspired by popular uprisings that ended the reign of the long-standing rulers of Tunisia and Egypt . \n-LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Khaled al-Mahdi in Taiz , John Irish in Paris , Mahmoud Habboush , Nour Merza , and Sara Anabtawi in Dubai ; writing by Jon Herskovitz and Firouz Sedarat in Dubai ; editing by Mark Heinrich and Lin Noueihed -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe London Metal Exchange said earlier this month that it was considering building its own clearing system , which it believes would add to earnings . \nIt said on Tuesday the results of a feasibility survey that began in August 2010 should be ready `` in the coming months . '' \nMarket participants are taking a wait-and-see approach as the LME 's proposal given a lack of detail . \nThey say they can see the potential for added cost but not yet for return . \nExchange members said they were concerned about contributing to a number of default funds , as well a potential loss of margin offsets and capital requirements as European regulators get tougher on over the counter trade . \nA default fund is the capital held by a clearing house in case one of its members defaults . \nMarket sources also raised concerns about a new entrant to the clearing landscape just as the sector could be ripe for consolidation . \nClearnet confirmed on Saturday it has received offers from exchange operators interested in pursuing some form of business tie-up but said talks were still at an early stage . \n`` There is no doubt the LME could provide a clearing house . \nThe question is does the world want that ? '' \nsaid an executive at a category one member of the exchange . \n`` It 's going to depend on what people think about the market evolution . '' \n`` My view is that it is more difficult to see that people will want more clearing houses rather than less ... In an ideal world you would have one clearing house that gives you the maximum netting and the minimum amount you need to put up . '' \nIn its statement the LME said : `` The LME executive has been concerned that the decisions by ICE , NYSE Liffe and the LSE to self-clear would undermine LCH . \nClearnet 's viability as a clearing house for exchanges . '' \nIt also suggested that the clearing house has engaged in competitive practices that are not in the LME 's best interests by launching independently cleared products in steel . \nA new clearing house would aim to maintain existing clearing fees and revenue models so members would receive the same rate of return on margins and defaults , said the exchange . \n`` It is a matter of record that LCH . \nClearnet collects some 10 million pounds annually in direct fees for clearing LME trades , '' the LME said . \n`` Modelling ... indicates that treasury revenue from members ' margin funds brings LCH . \nClearnet a further return that is a multiple of the clearing fee income . '' \nTreasury revenue , partially paid back to members , is essentially the return from cash posted as collateral . \nThe exchange also said work on establishing the size of any potential default fund has not begun . \n`` Would we be happy with that clearing house ? \nUntil you see how that is going to be set up , what the capital layer is , what the default fund is , what the insurance layer is , what the cascade is , you ca n't tell , '' the executive said . \nThe LME said it has not made a final decision on how it would finance a new clearing house but that expects little problem in raising debt finance . \nIt also said it would consider a rights issue if there was sufficient shareholder appetite . \n-LRB- Reporting by Melanie Burton and Susan Thomas , editing by William Hardy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAsked about the promised amnesty , the United States said Assad needed to take concrete action . \n`` He has talked reform but we have seen very little in the way of action ... he needs to take steps -- concrete steps , not rhetoric -- to address what is going on in the country , '' U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \nActivists said at least five people were killed on Tuesday when tanks shelled the central town of Rastan and security forces stormed Hirak , a town in the southern Hauran Plain where the uprising first broke out in mid-March . \nSyria blames the violence on armed groups , Islamists and foreign agitators , saying more than 120 police and soldiers have been killed in the unrest nationwide . \nThe official SANA news agency said two soldiers were killed in an operation to arrest `` armed terrorist groups '' in Rastan . \nIt quoted a military source saying army and security forces seized weapons and ammunition in Rastan and killed or injured `` a number of armed terrorists . '' \nThe United States , which has called Assad 's repression of protests `` barbaric , and the European Union , have announced sanctions against the president and senior Syrian officials . \nWestern nations have also been pushing for the United Nations Security Council to condemn the violent repression in Syria , but veto-wielding council members Russia and China have both expressed reservations over a draft resolution . \n`` The Chinese government supports Syria 's efforts to protect its sovereignty and stability and we hope that stability and order in Syria will be restored as soon as possible , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news briefing . \n`` In the current circumstances , we believe that the adoption of the U.N. Security Council resolution would do no good for the easing of tensions and stability in Syria . '' \nThe U.N. children 's agency UNICEF called on Syria to investigate reports of `` horrific acts '' of violence against children detained during the current wave of unrest . \nIn a statement , UNICEF said use of live ammunition against demonstrators had reportedly killed at least 30 children , although it said it could not independently confirm that figure or the circumstances of their death . \nSyrian television said on Tuesday the Interior Minister Mohammad al-Shaar had launched an investigation into the killing of Hamza Khatib , a 13-year-old boy who activists say died after being tortured in detention . \nFootage of his bruised and bloodied body has been widely disseminated on the Internet . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the report showed a collapse of Assad 's will to listen to his people . \n`` President Assad has a choice , and every day that goes by the choice is made by default . \nHe has not called an end to the violence against his own people , and he has not engaged seriously in any kind of reform efforts , '' she said . \n`` Every day that goes by the position of the government becomes less tenable and the demands of the Syrian people for change only grow stronger . '' \nOne of the main demands of protesters has been the release of political prisoners , as well as curbing the all-powerful security forces and ending corruption . \nThe ruling Baath Party has banned opposition and curbed political freedoms since 1963 . \nProtests have spread across the country , although the two main cities of Damascus and Aleppo , where security forces are heavily deployed , have yet to witness major sustained protests . \nThe central province of Homs , north of Damascus , has seen some of the biggest demonstrations and is the latest focus of the military campaign to crush dissent . \nTuesday 's violence brings to 16 the number of civilians killed since troops and tanks surrounded towns and villages in the Homs region on Sunday , according to tallies by activists . \nOfficials say six members of the security forces have been killed in the same operation . \nAssad assumed power when his father , Hafez al-Assad , died in 2000 after three decades of rule . \nThe elder Assad crushed an armed Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama in 1982 , flattening part of the old city and killing many thousands . \nThe younger Assad has reinforced his father 's close ties with Iran and its support for militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas , while holding intermittent peace talks with Israel which seized the Golan Heights from Syria in a 1967 war . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNow if they were smart , the Syrian opposition would appeal to Recep Erdgogan to send that flotilla to Tartous port of Syria . \nThe statement by Chinese officials shows what they are really about . \nThey fear another Tienamin and by supporting the Syrian crackdown , they seek to justify their own barbarism . \nIt is time to stand up to these people and call them to account for their own atrocities as well as their manipulation of their currency and the slave labor they use to produce cheap goods they dump on the United States . \nBalance the budget and stop borrowing from them !!!!!!

Security Council and are increasingly critical of NATO 's operation to protect civilians in Libya . \n`` The problem for the West is that several key players on the council now feel that the authority they granted was abused and they 're not inclined to help the West extricate itself , '' said David Bosco of American University in Washington . \nThe rebels face a government with superior firepower and resources but they achieved a financial breakthrough Monday , selling oil worth $ 100 million paid for through a Qatari bank in U.S. dollars , a member of their oil-and-gas support group said . \nGiven the rebels ' failure to achieve their primary target of unseating Gaddafi , the war increasingly is focussed on Misrata , Zintan and a Libyan border crossing near the Tunisian town of Dehiba . \nTwo rebel spokesmen in Misrata spoke of intense fighting in the city and at its strategically important airport . \n`` There is fighting also near the airport . \nThe revolutionaries control the western side while the -LRB- government -RRB- brigades are still holding the southeastern side of the airport . \nNATO struck today in the areas of Tamina and Chantine , east of the city , '' Reda told Reuters by telephone . \nRebels are trying to extinguish fires at a fuel storage depot bombarded by the government Friday . \nThe attack created fuel shortages , rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said . \nA ship chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross arrived in Misrata , bringing medical supplies , spare parts to repair water and electrical systems and baby food . \nThe war has killed thousands and caused extensive suffering , not least for tens of thousands of economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa forced to flee overland or by boat . \nDozens have died trying to reach Italy and the migration creates not only the possibility of a humanitarian crisis but also poses a political headache for NATO and the European Union . \nTraumatised migrants told the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- they saw a boat carrying hundreds of people founder off the Libyan coast last week , the IOM said Monday . \nThe migrants who reached Italy 's Lampedusa island , a collection point , also said Libyan soldiers drove them onto another vessel in what IOM officials said Monday was the first known forced evacuation from Libya in the conflict . \nThe sinking boat was seen between Thursday and Friday last week just off Tripoli , the Libyan capital controlled by forces loyal to Mummar Gaddafi . \nIt had been carrying 500 to 600 people , the IOM said , citing the migrants it had interviewed . \nThey saw bodies washed ashore in Libya and it was not clear how many survived . \nOne Somali woman managed to swim to land and board another vessel , but she lost her four-month-old baby who had been with her , the agency said . \n`` She was in a state of shock when she arrived on Lampedusa , '' Daria Storia of the IOM said . \n-LRB- Reporting by Joseph Nasr in Berlin , Matt Robinson in Dehiba , Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers , David Brunnstrom in Brussels , Amena Bakr in Abu Dhabi , Louis Charbonneau in New York and Sami Aboudi in Cairo ; Writing by Matthew Bigg ; Editing by Michael Roddy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nWitnesses and officials said supporters of Ahmar , head of the Hashed tribal federation to which Saleh 's Sanhan tribe also belongs , controlled several ministry buildings near Ahmar 's compound including the trade and tourism ministries , as well as the offices of the state news agency Saba . \nAhmar 's fighters also attacked the main building of the Interior Ministry , whose courtyard came under fire from rocket-propelled grenades , witnesses said . \nTelevised images of Ahmar 's own compound showed tribesmen rushing through opulent but dusty halls , their floors spattered with blood , as they helped colleagues wounded in the fighting . \nSaleh told a group of invited reporters including a Reuters correspondent on Wednesday that his government was `` steadfast . '' \n`` We are bearing the shocks of what happened from the sons of al-Ahmar : the chaos and the attacks on state institutions , the press and the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Interior . \nThis is a provocative act to drag us into a civil war ... `` We are contacting some people to talk to them and persuade them to stop trying to storm the Interior Ministry and opening fire at the ministry in order to avoid widening the conflict . '' \nSaba said four civilians had been killed and 11 injured in Wednesday 's fighting . \nSaleh 's about-turn on Sunday , after loyalist gunmen trapped Western and Arab diplomats in the United Arab Emirates embassy for hours , appeared to have sparked a major reaction . \nGeneral Ali al-Mohsen , a regional army commander who has sided with protesters , called on the armed forces to defy Saleh . \n`` Beware of following this madman who is thirsty for more bloodshed , '' Mohsen said in a statement . \n`` I think there 's a real risk that violence can escalate , and we see a move toward low-intensity civil war , '' said Shadi Hamid , analyst at the Brookings Doha Center . \n`` There 's a real loss of faith in the political process after Saleh refused to sign a deal several times . \nThat really cast doubt on whether Saleh has any real commitment to letting go of power voluntarily . '' \nSaleh said the deal remained on the table , despite his repeated failure to sign : `` I am ready to sign within a national dialogue and a clear mechanism . \nIf the mechanism is sound , we will sign the transition of power deal and we will give up power ... `` No more concessions after today , '' he said . \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of foiled attacks by a wing of al Qaeda based in Yemen , have tried to defuse the crisis and avert any spread of anarchy that could give the global militant network more room to operate . \nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 's spokesman Martin Nesirky said Ban was deeply troubled by the clashes in Sanaa and called for further peace efforts and an immediate end to the fighting , while Britain reiterated calls on Saleh to sign the exit deal . \n"}

{"id": "271", "time": "2011-09-26", "text": "NEW YORK | Mon Sep 26 , 2011 6:19 am BST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters Health -RRB- - Company-sponsored infant formula samples are still the norm at many hospitals , although fewer are giving out the freebies now than in 2007 , according to a new report . \nExperts worry that giving new moms the free samples could undermine official recommendations that they stick to breastfeeding until their baby is at least six months old . \n`` If a hospital gives it out ... the patient thinks it 's the best thing for the baby , '' said Anne Merewood from Boston Medical Center , who worked on the new study . \n`` The bottom line is that the hospitals are marketing for the formula industry . '' \nThe free samples typically come in diaper bags that maternity wards give out to moms when they leave the hospital . \nSometimes those bags are funded by the hospital . \nBut as research has shown , more often than not they 're provided by formula companies . \n`` The companies have an incentive to give as much away early on , because it kind of gets hospitals and mothers hooked on that , '' said Chessa Lutter , regional advisor on food and nutrition for the Pan American Health Organization , part of the World Health Organization . \nIn 2007 , Merewood and her colleagues surveyed hospitals in every state and found that more than 90 percent of them gave company-sponsored formula to mothers . \nTo see if anything had changed , last year the researchers went back to all hospitals in the 10 states that were most likely to give out free formula and the 10 that were least likely to do so . \nOf the more than 1,200 hospitals in those 20 states , 72 percent said they gave out company-sponsored samples to some or all mothers , compared to the 86 percent in 2007 . \nMerewood said that trend may be due to grassroots movements working to promote breastfeeding . \nThe states least likely to hand out the freebies include California , Massachusetts and Minnesota . \nYet the 10 states most likely to give out samples , including Oklahoma , New Jersey and Texas still distribute them at 93 percent of their hospitals , the researchers reported Monday in Pediatrics . \n`` Most of them are still giving it out , '' Merewood told Reuters Health . \n`` It 's not too rosy a picture . '' \nThe free samples are an ethical issue for hospitals because mothers might think that their doctors endorse the formula , and that they should use it instead of , or in addition to breastfeeding , Merewood said . \nShe and Lutter said that just about all formula companies sponsor samples , because they 're at a competitive disadvantage when moms shop for formula on their own if they do n't . \nLutter , who was n't involved in the new study , said there 's no law in the U.S. saying formula companies ca n't use hospitals to give out samples of their products -- but the WHO has come out strongly against that practice in all countries . \nNot accepting free formula , she said , `` is essential for assuring that the knee-jerk reaction for hospital -LRB- staff -RRB- as well as moms is not to go to the formula when there 's any question or any concerns '' about breastfeeding . \nBreastfeeding has a number of health benefits for kids , Lutter pointed out . \nThat includes prevention against infection , and possibly an IQ boost . \nAfter six months of exclusive breastfeeding , the WHO recommends at least partial breastfeeding up to two years or longer . \nWhile formula might be helpful when new mothers ca n't breastfeed for one reason or another , free samples usually do little good , Merewood said . \n`` Nurses like to give things to people , especially when they 're not very wealthy , '' she told Reuters Health . \n`` It 's not really a gift , because it 's not good for their health . '' \nAbbott Nutrition , which makes formula , would not comment on the study . \nThe International Formula Council , which represents formula manufacturers and marketers , told Reuters Health that formula samples serve a valuable purpose . \n`` The IFC believes mothers should be trusted to make good choices for their babies according to their individual family circumstances , '' it said in an email to Reuters Health . \n`` Hospital discharge packs provide key educational materials , which may include an infant formula sample -- directing moms to the right type of formula and to proper use and storage instructions , if needed . '' \nBut Lutter and Merewood agreed that there 's little room for debate about the right move for hospitals when it comes to company freebies . \n`` Hospitals should not accept any donations of a formula , '' Lutter said . \nly\\/jsoh2P Pediatrics , online September 26 , 2011 . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

General Assembly . \n`` The United States has sanctions regarding Syria . \nOur foreign ministers will be working together to decide what our sanctions may be , '' Erdogan said . \n`` As a result of this cooperation , the sanctions may not resemble those on Libya . \nEvery sanction differs according to country , people and demographic structure . \nThus , sanctions on Syria will be different . \nWe have preliminary studies on the issue , '' he said , according to the state agency Anatolian . \nAssad 's attempt to stamp out dissent by having troops and tanks assault restive areas has prompted the United States and European Union to gradually escalate economic sanctions against the authoritarian Damascus leadership . \nTurkey , which has been Syria 's main trading partner , had resisted sanctions up to now after suffering the consequences of past generations of sanctions imposed on next-door Iraq during Saddam Hussein 's rule and now on Iran , another neighbor . \nBilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , up from $ 500 million in 2004 . \nInvestments of Turkish firms in Syria reached $ 260 million , Turkish official data show . \nTurkey , a Muslim member of NATO that has applied to join the European Union , is one of the few countries in the world that has had open communication lines with Damascus . \nUnder Turkey 's policy of `` zero problems '' with its neighbors , Ankara built up political and commercial relations with Syria after the two almost went to war in the 1990s over Kurdish guerrillas harboured by Damascus . \nBut with Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkish camps across the border and Assad defying repeated international calls to return his forces to barracks and open up to reform , Turkey has found itself in the awkward position of trying to champion democracy in the region while maintaining ties , especially for trade purposes , with the Middle East 's autocratic leaders . \nThe United States and EU , along with the governments of Britain , France and Germany , have called for Assad to quit . \nErdogan , who once vacationed together with Assad and his family on the Turkish Mediterranean coast , has stopped short of calling for his departure . \nBut he told journalists in New York , `` We do not have any confidence in the current government , '' and accused Damascus of launching `` dark propaganda against Turkey '' . \nThe Syrian crisis has pushed Ankara and Washington into closer cooperation , despite U.S. concerns over a fraying of relations between its allies Turkey and Israel . \nSyria sits at the heart of numerous conflicts in the Middle East , and Turkey and Iran have competed for influence there . \nAn unstable Syria would have repercussions for Turkey , which also borders Iran and Iraq . \n"}

'' \nShukr and Alloush , from Lebanon 's anti-Syria opposition parties , then traded expletives . \nPrime Minister Najib Mikati 's government , which is backed by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian parties , angered the opposition and surprised even some cabinet members by choosing to vote against Syria 's suspension , rather than abstaining as it has done at United Nations votes on Syria . \n`` We are seeing an escalation of political tensions . \nIt is a sign Lebanon is split , '' said Minister of Public Works Ghazi Aridi . \n`` We should have taken a neutral stance ... What we saw on television last night is a direct result of these rising tensions . \nIt 's not only unfortunate and embarrassing , it 's worrying , '' he told Reuters . \nLebanon has maintained relative calm despite the bloodshed across its borders . \nMany Lebanese , haunted by the specter of their 1975-1990 civil war that divided the country along sectarian lines , have been tight-lipped about Syria 's conflict , which many also worry could spiral into sectarian war . \nSome politicians have posted increasingly heated comments on Twitter , which has grown in appeal as a platform for Lebanese political leaders from President Michel Suleiman to former prime minister and opposition leader Saad al-Hariri . \nOn Sunday , after Lebanon 's vote against Syria 's suspension in the Arab League , Hariri posted a string of critiques on the social network . \n`` They will be judged by the Lebanese and the Arabs and by history for their immoral and subservient abandonment of all national and human dignity , '' he wrote , adding that the vote put Lebanon on `` The side of murder , dictatorship and anti-Arab identity .

'' \nIraqi Shi'ite militias are unlikely to fight for Assad 's survival , but might respond if Sunnis in Iraq 's western Anbar province were emboldened by the rise of Sunni power in Syria . \nSyria was the only Arab nation to side with Iran in the 1980-88 war with Iraq . \nAssad 's minority Alawite sect is a distant offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . \nSyria links Iran logistically with its Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah guerrilla proteges . \nDespite violent repression that , by a U.N. count , has killed 2,700 people , Assad has failed to quell six months of protests mostly involving majority Sunnis . \nThe anti-Assad movement has sought to shun any sectarian agenda , but Sunni Islamists may emerge as a significant force if the president is deposed . \n`` Will Iran , Hezbollah in Lebanon and their allies in Iraq stand idle and watch Assad collapse and thus bring down with him one of the pillars of the ` Shi'ite Crescent ' without reacting ? \nImpossible , '' said Iraqi political analyst Ibrahim al-Sumaidaie . \n`` Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab powers will try to redraw the political map in Iraq to increase Sunni influence in decision-making because until now they have not made peace with Shi'ite rule here , '' he said . \nTo protect their interests , Syria , Hezbollah and Iran would `` try to unsettle the security situation in Iraq through their relationships with Shi'ites and Sunnis '' , Sumaidaie added . \nSince the fall of Saddam , a bitter foe of Tehran , some Sunni rulers in the Middle East have talked of the emergence of a `` Shi'ite Crescent '' running from Iran through Iraq and Alawite-ruled Syria to Hezbollah-controlled Lebanon . \nIran , projecting a pan-Islamic image , rejects any such sectarian concept , referring instead to an `` axis of resistance '' . \nThe Islamic Republic 's influence , which has burgeoned since the U.S.-led war in Iraq , would take a damaging hit if Assad fell , with repercussions for Iraq and the rest of the region . \nIraq is trying to end a legacy of sectarian violence that drove it to the brink of civil war in 2006-07 , just as U.S. troops prepare to complete their withdrawal by December 31 . \nIt has taken a muted stance on Syria , while Saudi Arabia and some other Arab nations have condemned Assad 's crackdown . \nIraqi Shi'ite politicians can give Assad diplomatic and financial support , said the senior politician , `` because we do n't want a government inimical to Iraq to be installed in Damascus '' . \nHe said Iraq could provide intelligence on people and arms being smuggled across the border , and ensure ample trade and financial ties with Syria , which last week banned most imports in an effort to conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves . \nSyria , which also borders Israel , Lebanon , Turkey and Jordan , has some influence in Iraq , although the two countries feuded when each was ruled by rival wings of the Baath Party . \nSaddam 's fall in 2003 brought majority Shi'ites to power in Iraq , which now has better ties with Iran and Syria , allies in a regional power struggle against U.S.-backed Sunni-ruled states . \nLast year Iran brokered a deal between Iraq 's main Shi'ite factions , helping them tighten their grip on power , with the blessing of Syria and Turkey , guaranteeing another term for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki , a Shi'ite , Iraqi politicians say . \nMany Iraqi Shi'ite politicians believe Saudi Arabia and other Sunni countries are scheming to topple Assad -- and push Iraqi Sunnis to secede and create their own region . \n`` If Saudi Arabia became influential in Syria , the Wahhabis will join forces with the people in western Iraq . \nThere will be a war inside Iraq , '' said the senior Shi'ite politician . \nSaudi Arabia , whose monarchy rules in a pact with ultra strict Wahhabi clerics , is at odds with Iraq 's Shi'ite - led government and intervened in Bahrain to help its Sunni rulers crush protests led by majority Shi'ites earlier this year . \nRiyadh was already alarmed at popular revolts that had overthrown the U.S.-aligned presidents of Egypt and Tunisia . \n`` We do n't fear Sunni rule in Syria , but we fear Wahhabi influence in Syria . \nWe have evidence that Saudi Arabia wants to break the Shi'ite Crescent , '' said a Shi'ite lawmaker . \n`` If a radical Sunni region was created here that wants to overthrow the Shi'ites , everyone will fight , '' said the lawmaker , a member of the Badr Organisation , the former armed wing of the Iranian-backed Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council . \n`` We have enough weapons to arm everyone . '' \nThe lawmaker ruled out military intervention in Syria by Iraqi Shi'ite militias armed and funded by Iran . \nBut he left the door open for an internal Iraqi sectarian conflict if the outcome of the Syrian crisis undermines Shi'ites in Iraq . \nIraq has dozens of Sunni and Shi'ite armed groups fighting for turf . \nThe two best-known Shi'ite militias , Asaib al-Haq and Kata'ib Hizballah , are Iranian-backed splinters from the Shi'ite Mehdi Army of anti-U.S. cleric Moqtada al-Sadr . \nIraqi politicians said Iran was watching Syria with alarm and would try to prevent any hardline Sunni grab for power in western Iraq , using its sway with Shi'ites , Kurds and Sunnis . \n`` Iran has many good relationship with Sunni tribal sheikhs in Anbar and Salahudin provinces ... to protect Shi'ite unity and stop any plan to establish an Islamist Sunni emirate in Iraq , '' said the Shi'ite lawmaker . \nAnother senior Shi'ite politician close to Maliki said if Tehran loses Damascus as an ally , it would use financial aid and diplomacy to try to build up Iraq as a Shi'ite regional power . \n`` Iranian clout in Iraq is stronger than any other country . \nBecause it built a relationship with the Sunnis , Shi'ites and Kurds and it will influence the political landscape in Iraq through this , '' the politician said . \n"}
{"id": "237", "time": "2011-09-28", "text": "LONDON | Wed Sep 28 , 2011 10:58 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Syrian army defectors begin launching attacks on government forces , Syria 's largely peaceful rebellion appears in danger of descending into a sectarian civil war with wider regional consequences . \nForces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday attempted to wrest control of a central town from military forces that had gone over to the opposition , whilst in other towns there were also reports of fighters coming together . \nDetails were far from clear and diplomats and other sources said defecting units appeared a `` hodgepodge '' who might struggle to mount a sustained fight against superior forces . \nProtesters have occasionally seized weapons to attack security forces , but witnesses say protests have been generally peaceful . \nThe appearance of loosely organized groups of military deserters lends a new dimension to the uprising . \n`` The strategy of peaceful opposition is clearly losing ground in the face of Assad 's brutal counter response and the call to arms is gaining currency as the only way of dislodging the regime , '' said Julien Barnes-Dacey , Middle East analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . \n`` The key question is whether or not this will spread and result in a more decisive break right across the military . '' \nMost believe that is unlikely . \nSyria 's military has long been divided along sectarian lines and most expect that the units most dedicated to Assad -- made up largely of Alawites who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam -- will remain loyal . \nThat could leave neither side with the strength to win and open the door to months or years of war . \nThe risk , experts say , is that neither side feels they can back down with the opposition fearing they will be hunted down and killed if Assad can reassert control whilst Alawites and other allied groups fear reprisals if he goes . \nWhilst some in Syria 's somewhat unsupported opposition may have ambitions of repeating the success of their counterparts in Libya in ultimately marching on the capital and taking power , few analysts believe that a plausible imminent outcome . \n`` The regime will most likely use this to in order to justify and further intensify its bloody crackdown , '' says Anthony Skinner , Middle East and North Africa director at political risk consultancy Maplecroft . \n`` This increases the risk of Syria sliding into a civil war . '' \nSome worry about a further regionalization of the conflict . \nIn Bahrain , largely Sunni Gulf states backed the monarchy as it crushed unrest from primarily Shi'ite demonstrators demanding equal rights in jobs and public services . \nThat raised hackles on both sides of the Middle East 's sectarian divide that could worsen further if largely Shi'ite Iran ramps up support for its long-time ally Assad and Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia move closer to backing the opposition . \n`` This has a lot of worrying regional implications , particularly if it leads to Syria moving toward becoming a failed state , '' said Stephen Heydemann , a senior vice president and regional specialist at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington . \n`` There 's a risk it could exacerbate regional tensions that have already been made worse by Bahrain . '' \nSectarian fighting in Syria could also raise tensions between assorted other smaller cross-border groupings in neighboring countries including Alawites and Kurds in Turkey and Shi'ites and Sunnis in Lebanon . \nFor now , analysts say it is still too soon to say whether enough soldiers will defect to form a force that could be a significant military threat to the Damascus government . \n`` The rate of defections is increasing , '' says Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE . \n`` However ... it is coming amid a fall in the number of protests throughout the country -- which are slowly losing momentum amid the ongoing crackdown . \nIt will take significantly greater numbers of defectors to significantly threaten the regime . '' \nNor is it yet clear to what extent the wider , somewhat disparate opposition movement wants to embrace a more violent approach . \nThe Syrian National Council , a unified opposition formed this month to support the uprising , and the Local Coordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , the grassroots activist network that has powered the rolling demonstrations across Syria over the past six months , are explicitly against recourse to violence . \n`` It is not a countrywide trend , '' said Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group . \n`` In parts of the country people have been preparing themselves ... but continue showing restraint . \nIn others , they simply can not afford weapons . '' \nIn the longer run , some analysts say the opposition 's best hope is to try to hang on in the hope that ever tightening sanctions take their toll on Assad 's rule . \nSanctions will likely starve his government of the oil sales that make up some 30 percent of government revenue , whilst much of the wider economy is also now effectively moribund or shut down . \n`` The Libya option is n't there , particularly because the Europeans and other regional powers are n't willing to play the role they played in Libya , '' said Jon Alterman , Middle East program director of the Center for Security and International Studies in Washington DC . \n`` There might be the option of some kind of covert operations support for the opposition but it 's hard to see what the point or strategy might be . '' \nMany outside groups working with Syria 's protesters have long tried to persuade them that taking up arms is the wrong way of pursuing their struggle , encouraging them instead to pursue non-violent methods such as boycotts and strikes . \n`` Any violence committed by opposition forces will harm the movement , '' said Srdja Popovic , a Serbian activist involved in the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and who now works with dissident groups worldwide including the Syrians . \n`` It will also diminish the possibility of achieving unity within the Syrian people and building a realistic alternative .

'' \nNow analysts fear the growing frailty of the kingdom 's most senior leadership has diminished its diplomatic agility in a political system that relies on sustained interest from the top . \nThe conservative Islamic state is at odds with its key U.S. ally over how to respond to Arab pro-democracy movements and appears to have ceded some regional leadership to Turkey , which has taken a strong line against Israel and the Syrian president . \nUsed to working back channels and shunning the limelight , the kingdom has employed pocketbook diplomacy , pledging billions of dollars to Egypt and the Palestinian Authority . \nUnderpinning Saudi concerns are its fears that the fall of established rulers after popular revolts has created strategic opportunities for Middle East rival Iran , while instability , especially in Yemen , has gifted openings to al Qaeda . \n`` Saudi Arabia is a status quo power in a region where the majority of Arabs oppose the status quo , '' said Shadi Hamid , director of research at Brookings Doha Centre . \n`` So to the extent that democratic change provides an opening for hostile forces , they oppose democracy . '' \nNowhere was that more evident than in Bahrain , where Saudi forces intervened in March to help the island 's Sunni rulers crush pro-reform demonstrations backed by the Shi'ite majority . \nThe Saudis had already been upset with the United States for failing to prevent the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , whom they had seen as a vital ally against Iran . \nKing Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , who is in his 80s , is in poor health and can not work a full day , while Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud is abroad for medical treatment . \nThe next most senior man , Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , weighs in on foreign policy , but has been unwell himself and has a different approach on some international issues , especially with veteran Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal , who is also unwell . \n`` King Abdullah 's the central figure and ultimately calls the shots , but he 's not in perfect health and neither are the people around him , '' said Ghanem Nuseibeh , a political analyst and partner at Cornerstone Global consultants . \n`` It 's not contributing to the Saudis ' ability to create a coherent policy and establish facts on the ground . \nThe Saudi state is becoming an inactive , passive player . '' \nAlthough both King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Prince Saud have backed the Palestinian statehood claim in prepared texts released to journalists , neither read out their remarks , which could be a sign they are not pushing the matter forcefully . \nIndeed the king only said Riyadh would join others in support of the Palestinian bid , according to published remarks . \nBy contrast , in 2002 King Abdullah proposed a peace plan offering Israel pan-Arab recognition in return for a Palestinian state . \nIt was rejected by Israel , but remains the corner-stone of Arab policy on the region 's most stubborn impasse . \nInstead of a fresh diplomatic offensive to coincide with the request for the U.N. Security Council to recognize a Palestinian state , the kingdom has worked mostly behind the scenes . \nThis month a senior Saudi prince wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times warning that Washington 's promised veto of the resolution would make its relationship with Riyadh `` toxic . '' \nPrince Turki al-Faisal , a former intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington and London , has no formal role , but his words were widely interpreted as a message from King Abdullah . \nJordan , the former U.S. envoy , said the Saudis were unlikely to risk the basic relationship with the United States over any U.N vote , suggesting their leverage on that issue was limited . \n`` They recognize how closely vital Saudi interests are tied to vital U.S. interests on a whole range of issues from counter-terrorism to Iran and maintaining a balanced price of oil , '' he said . \n`` It would be almost unthinkable for there to be a major rupture such that the two countries fail to cooperate . '' \nSaudi policy on Yemen , where more than 100 people have been killed in a week of clashes between opponents and supporters of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , also lacks force , say analysts . \nSaleh spent three months in Riyadh recuperating from an assassination attempt before returning to Sanaa on Friday . \nAny expectation that Saleh would bow out to end the crisis roiling Yemen since protests erupted in January fell flat . \nHe offered no concessions and no clear path to transfer power . \nSaudi princes have strong networks of influence throughout Yemen , which the kingdom regards as its top security risk , and have spent freely on their unruly neighbor in the past . \nHowever , while Riyadh has backed a Gulf-brokered plan for Saleh to step down , it has failed to pressure the veteran Yemeni leader to implement an orderly transfer of power . \n`` Yemen is a clear example of where the Saudi regime is unable to make a decision on what they want , '' said Nuseibeh , arguing that top Saudi figures supported rival Yemeni factions and did not know what to do with Saleh when he was in Riyadh . \nSaudi policy on Syria has also seemed half-hearted . \nIn August , King Abdullah demanded an end to the bloodshed against protesters and withdrew his ambassador to Damascus , but has not followed through , for example by pushing for Arab League measures against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . \n-LRB- Editing by Reed Stevenson and Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` There has been a lot of talk from the opposition about militarization , but this is for now an expression of frustration more than a definite shift in strategy , '' Harling told Reuters , Citing residents , the Syrian Revolution General Commission , which groups several activist organizations , said Rastan neighborhoods had been under fire since early morning from anti-aircraft guns , tanks and armored personnel carriers . \n`` Two mosques were hit . \nHomes and clinics have been damaged , '' it said . \nWith communications cut in the area , there were no firm reports on casualties . \nOne local activist said on Tuesday that five civilians and rebel soldiers had been killed . \nIn another outbreak of armed opposition to Assad , people in the nearby city of Homs said rebel soldiers had hit a government tank with a rocket-propelled grenade on Tuesday . \nThe attack occurred in the Bayada district , home to desert tribesmen who are among Assad 's fiercest foes in the city of one million . \nActivists in Homs , Syria 's third largest city , said at least six inhabitants were killed in raids by security forces . \nSeveral doctors and professor have been assassinated in Homs in the past few weeks by what the authorities call `` terrorists . '' \nThe Local Coordination Committees and other activist groups , said the authorities were behind the killings to stoke sectarian strife in the city , which has a significant Alawite minority . \nSyrian authorities say `` armed terrorist groups '' are responsible for civilian deaths in the past six months of unrest and have also killed 700 members of the security forces . \nTurkey is preparing sanctions against Syria , a former ally , in a policy shift that aligns Ankara more closely with the West and complements a Turkish arms embargo already in place . \nAnkara has said the sanctions , expected to be unveiled within days after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan visits border camps sheltering more than 7,000 Syrians who have fled the violence , will target Assad 's government , not the Syrian people . \nOfficials say the measures will affect military , banking and energy ties between the formerly friendly countries . \n`` Turkey is reverting to the U.S. and European line on Syria , '' said foreign policy expert Semih Idiz . \n`` The relationship with Syria has collapsed and it is heading for a freeze . '' \nBritain , France , Germany and Portugal plan to circulate a draft U.N. resolution that condemns Syria , but drops calls for immediate sanctions against it , diplomats said on Tuesday . \nThe scaled-back resolution , aimed at breaking a deadlock on the Security Council , will threaten future sanctions if Assad 's government does not halt military attacks on civilians . \n"}
{"id": "333", "time": "2011-09-28", "text": "LONDON | Wed Sep 28 , 2011 2:06 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain 's productivity is at its lowest ebb in more than a decade , confounding the conventional wisdom about what should happen following a deep recession and giving a headache to both the Bank of England and government . \nThe jury is out on what exactly has caused productivity to flatline for the past three years . \nBut if the trend persists , then future quantitative easing from the Bank of England may serve only to keep inflation at more than double its two percent target , rather than boost anaemic growth . \nMoreover , the government might have to impose extra spending cuts or tax rises in order to slash its sky-high deficit , which weaker productivity and medium-term growth would render even less sustainable . \nBritish productivity grew by about 2.5 percent a year in the run-up to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 . \nIn the three years since then , growth has been close to zero . \nOutput per worker in Britain is now 13 percent below the average for other members of the G7 group of industrialised countries , the biggest shortfall since 1999 . \nOnly Japan has a worse story to tell . \nThis is not what economists would expect after a normal recession , during which uncompetitive businesses typically go bust and others cut costs , leaving leaner firms behind . \nBut Britain 's recession has not been normal . \nUnemployment has gone up less than in other countries and in past recessions , and fewer firms have gone bankrupt . \nThis would not necessarily be a bad thing for longer-term productivity if firms were simply holding on to staff , waiting for demand to pick up . \nBut in a speech last week , BoE chief economist Spencer Dale said businesses were not reporting much spare capacity , and had been adding jobs despite weak growth . \n`` Firms in some parts of our economy are having to work flat out just to generate the same amount of business . \nEstate agents , for example , trying to match buyers and sellers in a thin housing market . \nOr M&A teams pitching for new business , '' he said . \nFinancial services as a whole -- a major driver of productivity growth in Britain until 2007 -- are unlikely to be as significant in future , both because of their reduced size in the British economy , and because of tougher regulation that reverses the past decade 's liberalisation . \nAnother previously highly productive sector , North Sea oil and gas , is also suffering as increasingly scarce resources become more costly to extract . \nAnd a newly conservative banking sector makes it harder for entrepreneurs to start or expand businesses . \nThis last point was emphasised by Dale 's fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Ben Broadbent in a speech at Thomson Reuters ' London headquarters on Monday . \n`` As long as ... capital remains misallocated , productivity , national income and the share of it paid out as wages will all be lower than they otherwise would be , '' Broadbent said . \nThese concerns contributed to Dale 's decision to call for higher interest rates in the first half of this year . \nSlow productivity growth implies that the economy has less room to grow before it starts generating excess inflation . \nIn economists ' language , there is a smaller output gap and this may be a partial explanation for Britain 's unexpectedly sticky inflation after the credit crunch . \nSince then , prospects for global demand have weakened markedly , and economists polled by Reuters see a three in four chance that the Bank would start a second round of asset purchases with newly-created money . \nBritain 's productivity outlook will not determine that decision but it does have potential implications for QE 's effectiveness if the economy is already closing in on full capacity . \n`` If the patient 's in intensive care , you tend not to worry about the longer term implications of the medicine , '' said Adam Chester , an economist at Lloyds Corporate Markets . \n`` There is a risk that further QE is ineffective in boosting growth . \nIt could just be effective in boosting nominal asset prices . '' \nAdam Posen , the most long-standing advocate of more asset purchases on the MPC , would not disagree that QE would be more effective if Britain 's banking system functioned efficiently , and has recently proposed a new state-backed bank to lend to small businesses . \nOther economists concerned about Britain 's productivity , such as Citi economist Michael Saunders , are more relaxed about QE 's effect on inflation , arguing that there is still sufficient spare capacity in Britain 's economy to allow growth without excess price pressures . \nWhere weak productivity growth may pose a trickier problem is for Britain 's public finances . \nA central pledge of the coalition government is to eliminate the structural budget deficit within five years . \nLower productivity growth translates directly into lower trend growth for Britain 's economy -- meaning a bigger chunk of Britain 's 10 percent budget deficit-to-GDP ratio must be counted as a long-term , structural issue . \nThe government 's independent fiscal watchdog estimated in March that about a quarter of the deficit this year is down to short-term cyclical factors , and does not need specific government attention . \nBut if the Office for Budget Responsibility decides the output gap is smaller than thought , then the structural element of the deficit would be bigger . \nOBR head Robert Chote hinted that this might be the case in a speech last week , when he noted that productivity was growing much slower than the 2 percent annual rate assumed in the Office for Budget Responsibility 's March fiscal forecasts . \nAccording to David Tinsley , an economist for BNP Paribas , a 1 percent productivity growth rate would be more realistic for the next 5-10 years . \nHowever , he expected the OBR to avoid dropping a political bombshell by revising down its productivity growth estimates that much -- making it easier for the government to credibly defer any extra spending cuts until the economy is on a stronger footing . \n`` There are a lot of gray areas in the numbers so I do n't think it will want to prompt the government into doing anything particularly drastic , '' he said . \n`` If it does do anything it will be a question of -LRB- the government -RRB- doing some extra implied spending restraints in 2014 and 2015 .

'' \nThey will meet again to discuss Syria on September 13 . \nThe Cairo-based organization has been under pressure to speak out more openly following the uprisings that ousted leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and led to the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi -- achieved with NATO air intervention endorsed by the Arab League . \nThe United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Syria , and regional powers have grown increasingly critical of Assad , but no country has proposed the kind of international military action that helped bring down Gaddafi . \nAuthorities in Damascus blame armed groups for the violence and say 500 soldiers and police have been killed since the unrest erupted in the southern city of Deraa in mid-March . \nThe United Nations says 2,200 people have died in the uprising , while a Syrian grassroots organization says security forces have killed 3,000 civilians . \nSyria has barred most independent media , making it hard to verify accounts by activists and authorities . \nActivists said six people were killed during protests after midday prayers on Friday . \nIn a change to their demands , demonstrators called for international protection to stop civilian killings in what has become one of the most violent responses to the Arab uprisings that have swept the Middle East and North Africa . \nTheir calls were echoed on Saturday at a meeting in Vienna of Syrian expatriates which brought together 30 representatives of Syrian civil associations in 15 European countries . \n`` After the events in Syria ... we are distancing ourselves from the Syrian regime and declaring it illegitimate . \nOur further goal is to support the Syrian revolution and the opposition , '' said Amer Alkhatib , who described himself as spokesman for the Syrian community in Austria . \nAlkhatib said the group was collecting money to support the families of victims and lobbying host governments to take a hard line on the Assad government . \nIt was also seeking a United Nations commitment to protect civilians , though it was not calling for foreign military intervention on the ground . \nSyria 's powerful neighbor Turkey has indicated that its patience is wearing thin given the lack of progress in its efforts to convince Assad to halt the military assaults . \nThe European Union , which banned imports of Syrian crude oil last week , moved closer on Friday to banning investment in the oil industry , EU diplomats said . \nSyria is only a small oil producer but nearly all of its exports last year were bought by Europe , and European oil firms have investments there . \nHowever , there has been no hint in the West of any appetite for military action along Libyan lines . \nSyria has three times Libya 's population and , unlike Libya , is intricately linked to neighbors on the faultlines of Middle East conflicts . \nneighbors Syria has long had a strong alliance with Iran but , in an unusual sign of unease , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Assad this week to open talks with the opposition , saying a military crackdown was `` never the right solution .

'' \nAnger at the country 's failure to meet fiscal targets under its EU\\/IMF bailout has reached boiling point , prompting senior euro zone policymakers to cast doubt on its ability to avoid default or even its membership in the single currency . \nThe embattled premier , who was heckled by angry labor unions on Friday , said he would redouble efforts to fight endemic tax evasion , a main hurdle in achieving fiscal targets . \nHis Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said earlier Greece may even take additional fiscal measures in 2011 to make up for budget deficit slippage that threatens the disbursement of an 8 billion euro EU\\/IMF loan tranche . \nVenizelos pledged to further cut the civil service payroll , push privatisations and deepen labor market reforms . \nCivil servants , who have seen about a fifth of their wages slashed , will suffer more after the government decided to put thousands of them in a so-called `` Labor Reserve , '' in which they will draw 60 percent of their salary and possibly face dismissal if they find no other public sector job within a year . \nBut austerity measures are throwing the economy into an ever deeper recession . \nGDP will shrink by more than 5 percent this year , Venizelos said , topping earlier projections in its third straight year of contraction . \nMore than 20,000 protesters gathered in the northern city to mark Papandreou 's speech . \nPolice fired tear gas at youths smashing shop windows and setting fires on the main shopping streets . \nPolice said 106 people were detained . \nDemonstrations were organised by civil servants , students , taxi drivers and even football fans . \nSome restaurants in the city shut down to protest a VAT hike that took effect earlier this month . \n`` We are suffering an unprecedented tax raid ... we deeply worry about tomorrow , '' George Kasimatis , chairman of Greece 's Chamber of Commerce Federation , told Venizelos during the conference . \nAbout 7,000 police were patrolling the city 's streets , cordoning off the fairgrounds . \nMinisters canceled plans for their usual walkabouts in the city and Papandreou avoided touring the fair in the morning , as prime ministers traditionally do on the event 's first day . \nWhile vowing to keep its side of the bargain , the Greek government sharply criticised its EU partners for delaying ratification of a second , 109-billion-euro bailout for the country , agreed by euro zone leaders on July 21 . \n`` Europe must rise to the challenge and move towards implementing the July 21 decisions , to put an end to the Sisyphean ordeal the Greek people is going through , '' said Development Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis . \n`` Doing nothing is disastrous for all of us , '' he added . \nA G7 source said the troika -LRB- EU\\/IMF\\/ECB -RRB- , which suspended talks with Athens last week in frustration at Greece 's struggle to stick to its deficit reduction plan , would probably come up with a form of words in its next report to allow the next tranche of bailout funds to be paid . \nBut the working assumption is that Greece will not avoid default indefinitely . \nHowever , a bond swap plan for private bondholders , which is part of the second bailout plan and is supposed to ease Greece 's debt payments was progressing well , Venizelos said . \n`` The private sector is responding very well to the PSI -LRB- private sector involvement -RRB- , '' he said , without elaborating , one day after an initial deadline for banks to express interest in the scheme expired . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe Egyptian information minister 's statement followed a crisis meeting of his key cabinet members and talks with Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , who heads the military council that has ruled Egypt since Mubarak stepped down on February 11 . \nState television said the military council rejected an offer by Prime Minister Essam Sharaf to resign . \nIsrael is finding itself increasingly at odds with formerly sympathetic states in the region . \nIt is embroiled in a feud with Turkey , once the closest of its few Muslim allies , over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for Gaza . \nEgypt 's ties with Israel , though never warm , were a pillar of Mubarak 's foreign policy and buttressed his claim to be a regional mediator . \nUnder Mubarak , displays of hostility to Israel were crushed by force . \nU.S. President Barack Obama called on Egypt to `` honor its international obligations '' and protect the Israeli mission . \nHe told Israel 's Netanyahu that Washington was taking steps to resolve the situation . \nThe State Department said Washington had been in contact with Egyptian and Israeli officials over the violence . \n`` Israel and Egypt are key partners and allies of the United States , and both states have made clear their continuing commitment to maintain their bilateral relationship and the peace treaty between them , which remains a cornerstone of regional stability , '' Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said . \nEgyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr said Cairo was committed to `` fully respect all its international obligations regarding protecting and safeguarding international diplomatic missions on its soil , '' the state MENA news agency said . \nAn Israeli official said the ambassador , staff and family members had left in one plane and a second one had brought home six Israeli security personnel who had been left guarding the embassy , protected from the crowd only by a reinforced door until Egyptian troops extracted them . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the embassy attack and urged Egypt to protect diplomatic property . \nSome Egyptian politicians and activists criticised the violence , even if they backed the anti-Israel demonstration . \nPresidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahy called for the army to take a `` serious stance matching the public anger '' towards Israel but said violence sullied the image of Egypt 's uprising . \nLast month , a man scaled the embassy building , took down Israel 's flag and replaced it with Egypt 's . \nProtests continued daily but did not turn violent until the latest flare-up . \nIn response to the protests , the authorities had erected a wall around the building , which was quickly defaced with anti-Israel slogans and then painted in Egypt 's national colors . \nFriday , the wall was torn down . \n-LRB- Reporting by Yasmine Saleh , Mohamed Abdellah , Seham Eloraby , Ahmed Tolba and Sami Aboudi in Cairo , Dan Williams in Jerusalem , and Christopher Wilson and Timothy Gardner in Washington ; Writing by Edmund Blair ; Editing by Janet Lawrence -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt is still intact only for so long as the American Israel lobby can demand its government continues to pay Egypt US$ 2 billion and Israel US$ 3 billion annually . \nWhen that greasing money in the form of American tax dollars stops , then we can all start running for the fallout shelters . \nThere is no state in the M E that will voluntarily deal with Israel unless it is paid huge amounts of US money to do so . \nIt s political prostitution but who is the pimp that profits ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nGaddafi denies his forces target civilians and describes the rebels as criminals and religious extremists . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a London news conference on Monday : `` We do believe that time is working against Gaddafi , that he can not re-establish control over the country .

{"id": "259", "time": "2011-06-03", "text": "BEIRUT | Fri Jun 3 , 2011 11:11 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Bashar al-Assad has tried brute force and political concession , often simultaneously , to quell protests in Syria but neither has halted the uprising and his double-edged tactic may alienate a vital support base . \nSince the outbreak of unrest 11 weeks ago , the Syrian president has combined violent repression with efforts to appease demonstrators , a pattern repeated again this week . \nOn the day he declared an amnesty for political prisoners , activists said security forces killed dozens of civilians in the central town of Rastan , which had seen protests against Assad . \nTuesday 's amnesty was followed by steps toward a `` national dialogue '' to address popular grievances , while a dozen more people were reported killed in the military assault on the town . \nWhether the mixed messages are a deliberate strategy or a rushed reaction to Syria 's turmoil , analysts say they risk undermining the argument made by Assad supporters that the only alternative to his rule is civil strife . \n`` Syria 's minorities , middle classes and business establishment -- all three basically fear the alternatives to Assad and were initially receptive to the regime 's message of ` Us or Chaos ' , '' said a Damascus-based analyst . \n`` But the regime has been very inconsistent on all fronts : repression , reform , handling the economic fallout , as well as in terms of dialogue . \nIt 's been arresting people at the very moment when it needs interlocutors on the ground . '' \n`` So the formulation of `` us or chaos '' is gradually turning against it , '' said the analyst , who declined to be named . \nRights groups say 1,000 civilians have been killed in the unrest , which has seen protests sweep from the southern city of Deraa to the Mediterranean coast and eastern Kurdish regions . \nBut protests have been most intense in poorer , rural areas while the capital Damascus and second city Aleppo , with wealthier businesses and middle classes , have seen less disturbance , partly because of heavy security . \nAuthorities blame the violence on armed groups , Islamists and foreign agitators and say more than 120 police and soldiers have been killed . \nMost international media are prevented from operating in Syria , making it impossible to verify accounts from activists and authorities . \nWhile the demonstrations show no sign yet of reaching the scale needed to overthrow Bashar , they have continued to spread and analysts say protesters ' anger is growing . \nThe death of 13-year-old Hamza al-Khatib focused local and international fury at perceived brutality in Syria . \nActivists say he was tortured horrifically in captivity , a charge denied by authorities who say he died in crossfire at a protest . \nPeople in the southern towns of Dael and Deraa held posters of the young boy on Friday , witnesses said . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said this week his death symbolized the `` total collapse '' of any effort to address peoples ' grievances and that Assad 's legitimacy had `` nearly run out . '' \nDespite Clinton 's condemnation , and the fact that the protests have lasted far longer than uprisings which toppled Arab leaders in Tunisia and Egypt , the United States appears reluctant to make a clear call for Assad to go . \nThat reluctance stems partly from uncertainty over who might take over in Syria , a mainly Sunni Muslim country ruled for 41 years by Assad 's minority Alawite sect . \nUnder Assad and his father , Syria has been allied to Iran and backed militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas , but also held peace talks with Israel . \nA meeting of Syrian opposition figures in Turkey this week called for Assad to step down to pave the way for democracy , but gave little indication of how it might govern in his place . \n`` Although the regime may be losing ground with the silent majority , the opposition are not gaining anything because they are not answering any of the key questions that the crisis raises , '' the Damascus-based analyst said . \n`` In a state which is so fragile , how do you ensure successful transition ? \nWhat is these people 's agenda ? \nThey are focused on the issue of toppling the regime and they have been completely absent on key issues which people want answers on . '' \nAs the protests and crackdown continue -- a Syrian human rights group said 27 people were shot dead at a protest in the city of Hama on Friday -- there have been increasing reports of protesters responding with force . \nAnalysts say that protest marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful but that since the start of the unrest there were isolated cases of protesters taking up arms in Deraa , Tel Kelakh on the Lebanese border and most recently in Rastan . \n`` For the first time there have been real clashes and people are fighting back , '' said Rime Allaf , Associate Fellow in Chatham House . \n`` It is drastic that it is coming to this ... -LRB- though -RRB- it 's not widespread yet . '' \nA senior Western diplomat in Beirut said Lebanese politicians , allies and foes of Damascus alike , believed `` the situation in Syria is irreversible : `` Nothing like this has happened in modern Syrian history . \nThe regime is extraordinarily vulnerable . '' \nResistance from Russia and China has so far obstructed U.S. and European efforts for a United Nations resolution condemning Syria 's crackdown , and Assad has emerged once before from a period of Western isolation . \nBut he has seen two regional allies , Turkey and Qatar , distance themselves from his government in recent weeks , and Syria 's economy will suffer as tourism revenues dry up , investments are put on hold and sanctions against senior officials deter some international firms from doing business . '' \n-LRB- Assad 's rule -RRB- is not disintegrating , '' Allaf said . \n`` But this notion that little bits of so-called reform can be given and things will get back to normal , this is not going to happen .

Boakai said when he signed for the Liberian government on Monday . \nThe VPA Agreement sets out reforms across the timber sector that will enable it to keep selling to Europe when the EU adopts its 2012 regulation on illicit timber . \nLiberia must monitor harvesting and shipping of wood -- and be able to show it was legally sourced to be allowed into Europe , but doing so will give it a secure export market . \nLocal logging operators say they back the deal . \n`` We are happy to have a legal framework set up for the country , '' said Ricks Toweh , manager of Tree and Tree , adding that his company had helped draft the legislation . \n`` It is a new beginning for us .

'' \n`` We trust the Government will take all the appropriate actions , '' it ends . \nAfter several weeks of wrangling , Berlusconi 's centre-right government passed a 60 billion euro austerity package earlier this month which contains some of the steps outlined in the letter although the erratic manner in which it was agreed drew widespread criticism . \nThe government says it is on course to balance the budget by 2013 but expects a deficit of 1.6 percent by 2012 , well above the target in the letter , while much of the reduction has come through higher taxes . \nOther measures requested by the central bank , including pension reforms , cuts to public sector wages and new hiring and dismissal rules have either not been implemented or only partially addressed . \nTrichet has denied there was any direct deal between the ECB and the Italian government over the measures but just days after it was sent , the central bank began a controversial operation to buy Italian bonds in the market . \nYields on Italy 's 10 year bonds have come down from the levels of more than 6 percent they reached before the ECB intervened but market concern has been growing and a bond auction on Thursday is expected to see 10 year yields as high as 5.9 percent . \nThe letter said the ECB Governing Council had met on Aug 4 to discuss the sharp sell-off of Italian government bonds triggered by investor concern over the struggling government 's ability to tackle Italy 's mix of chronically weak growth and a mountainous public debt . \n`` The Governing Council considers that pressing action by the Italian authorities is essential to restore the confidence of investors , '' it said , adding that there was a need for `` significant measures to enhance potential growth . '' \nIt called for full liberalisation of local public services and professional services , with `` large scale privatizations '' in the local services sector . \nIt also urged further reforms to the collective bargaining system , allowing company-level wages and conditions agreements and a full review of hiring and firing rules in conjunction with the establishment of an unemployment insurance system . \nTurning to the fiscal side , the letter called on the government to bring forward measures already planned in a package of budget measures passed in July , with the aim of balancing the budget by 2013 , a year earlier than planned . \nIt called for pension reforms , including changes to the eligibility of seniority pensions and bringing the retirement age for women in the private sector into line with the public sector with the aim of already making savings in 2012 . \nIt also said the government should consider cutting the cost of public sector employees , by strengthening staff turnover rules and if necessary by wage cuts . \nIt urged an automatic deficit reduction clause , ensuring any slippage from deficit targets would be automatically made up by horizontal cuts on spending and said borrowing , including by regional and local governments , should be tightly controlled . \nThe government has announced plans for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution but the complicated rules governing the process mean it could take years to be implemented . \n"}

'' \nThe derogatory graffiti covering Tawargha 's walls makes it clear where many local fighters stand on the question of return . \n`` Tawargha , you dogs , 3,000 km this way , '' reads one message spray-painted on a road sign , beside an arrow pointing south into the Sahara desert . \n`` Formerly Tawargha , '' says another . \nMany of Tawargha 's erstwhile residents say they see little hope of returning home , partly because their dark skin makes them obvious targets for vengeful fighters in the area . \n`` It 's about the color of the skin . \nThat 's why they have problems with Tawargha , '' Samia Taher , a light-skinned Libyan woman born in Illinois who married into a Tawargha family , said as she rested near the mosque where families sheltered , a couple of km -LRB- miles -RRB- from the heart of Sirte , besieged by NTC forces . \nShe was interrupted by a burst of tank fire from a nearby hill . \nWomen in brightly-coloured headscarves gasped and children flinched as the boom echoed through the lot , where mattresses and blankets were piled up and men rested in the shade . \n`` I just want to get the family out of here . \nWe 're in the middle of a battle here in Sirte , '' Taher , speaking in American-accented English , said of the struggle for Gaddafi 's birthplace . \nMany NTC fighters deny their feud with Tawargha is about race . \nBut they are openly hostile toward the town , which they say supported Gaddafi in return for money and services . \nEven before the war , Misrata residents disparaged Tawargha , calling its young people criminals and drug addicts , or accusing its menfolk of marrying often and working little . \nScorn turned to outright hostility after Gaddafi 's forces assaulted Misrata with rockets , snipers and artillery to try to quash the uprising there in February , using Tawargha as a staging ground for a siege that killed more than 1,000 people . \nWith the help of NATO air strikes , anti-Gaddafi rebels were able to break the siege and take control of Tawargha . \nThe charred husks of tanks , unexploded rockets and bullet casings on the outskirts of the town testify to the battle 's ferocity . \nMany in Misrata accuse men from Tawargha of looting homes and raping women in Misrata during the siege , claims that are impossible to confirm , but display the depth of their enmity . \nAs evidence , one resident offered a cell phone video he said was found on a slain Gaddafi soldier . \nIt showed scores of black men in green military jackets with assault rifles marching down a tree-lined road he said led from Tawargha to Misrata . \nTawarghy and other residents admit that support for Gaddafi ran strong in their town , but are quick to add that this does not justify demonising and punishing an entire community . \nSome of those who have taken refuge in cities along the Mediterranean coast say their homes in Tawargha have been burned and that relatives or neighbors have been abducted or attacked . \nThe group of about 135 sheltering near Sirte ricocheted for months from town to town in search of a haven , only to end up in the crossfire of one of the civil war 's last battles . \n`` It 's all very tragic . \nWe lack security and safety , and we have to worry about food , '' Tawarghy -- the name he gave meaning one from Tawargha -- said . \n`` All this and you 're calling for freedom ? \nWhat kind of freedom are you seeking ? '' \nGallal , the NTC spokesman , said he expected residents who had not committed crimes to return to their homes eventually . \n`` The other solution would be mass relocation of people . \nThat 's hardly an ideal solution . \nThings are tense at the moment , but I think in time they will fall into place , '' he said . \nAny such restitution is sure to be complicated . \nMuch of Tawargha is in ruins . \nThe charred skeletons of cars , busted electronics and garbage cover the streets between bullet-scarred apartment blocks . \nGoats and camels wander amid the wreckage . \nGreen flags , a symbol of support for Gaddafi , still flutter over many buildings , more than a month after the deposed leader 's forces were pushed out of the capital , Tripoli . \nDespite NTC assurances , many in Misrata say it would only lead to more violence if Tawargha 's residents were allowed to return , even if some were innocent . \nThe crimes against Misrata were just too many and too heinous , they say . \n`` To avoid the recurrence of any future problems , we should separate the two groups , '' said a Misrata man named Saleh as he stood near a Tawargha apartment block being used as temporary shelter for non-Tawargha families fleeing fighting in Sirte . \n`` They should be compensated for their land and houses , and they should find a new area to live elsewhere . '' \nA man standing nearby echoed that view . \n`` Even if someone did n't do anything , his nephew or his cousin might have . \nMaybe 95 percent of people in Tawargha supported Gaddafi , '' he said . \n`` It 's better if they find somewhere else , far from Misrata .

{"id": "26", "time": "2011-11-14", "text": "BEIRUT | Mon Nov 14 , 2011 12:21 pm EST BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad , self-styled champion of Arab unity , faces deepening isolation after fellow Arab states announced sanctions on Syria for his eight-month crackdown on protests calling for his overthrow . \nFor the leader of a country which , under 40 years of Assad family rule , has portrayed itself as the principal defender of Arab rights , the Arab League 's move on Saturday was a wounding blow . \nHis military crackdown on the uprising , in which the United Nations estimates 3,500 people have been killed , had already alienated former ally Turkey and led Western nations to impose sanctions and call for him to step down . \nBut the surprise decision by the Arab League to suspend Syria and announce political and economic sanctions marked a dramatic new low in Assad 's international standing , leaving him ever more dependent on a close alliance with non-Arab Iran . \nAssad 's determination to crush an uprising which he blames on Islamist militants backed by foreign powers , coupled with the resilience of street protests and the emergence of an armed insurgency , has made Syria 's uprising one of the most intractable conflicts of this year 's Arab revolts . \nHis use of tanks to seize back control of the city of Hama in August revived memories of his father 's crushing of an uprising nearly 30 years ago , and led U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accuse him of `` losing all sense of humanity . '' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warned Assad last month that the `` barbaric repression '' in Syria would `` end with the fall of the regime , '' and even ally Russia said he risked a `` sad fate '' unless he ended the violence and implemented reforms . \n`` If he just defiantly continues to defy signals from the Arab world and international community it 's increasingly grim for him , '' said Rami Khouri , a Beirut-based Middle East analyst . \nJust weeks before the uprising erupted in March , the 46-year-old leader said Syria was immune from the rebellions which have overthrown the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya because its foreign policy was closely aligned with popular Arab sentiment . \nIn a speech at Damascus University in June , one of just a handful of addresses he has made since the unrest began , Assad justified the crackdown and said he was overwhelmed with support from Syrians he had met to discuss the crisis . \n`` The love I felt from those people who represent most of the Syrian people is something I have never felt at any stage of my life , '' he said . \nIn fact the unrest has polarized Syria . \nMany demonstrators now openly chant for Assad 's execution -- a scene unimaginable eight months ago -- but he is still able to rally huge crowds for state-organized demonstrations and retains a core of support particularly among minority Christians and his own Alawite sect . \nAlongside the military campaign against protests , Assad has lifted a state of emergency in place for nearly 50 years , approved laws to allow parties other than his ruling Baath Party to be established , and promised dialogue with the opposition . \nThe characteristically ambiguous stance , mixing iron-fisted security while holding out the promise of change , helped to mute international criticism in the early stages of the uprising . \nBut critics said his decision to send troops into several cities in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan four months ago showed he had chosen the `` security option '' to crush the protests rather than address their grievances . \nTall and softly spoken Assad was thrust into the spotlight after the death of his elder brother Basel in a car crash in 1994 . \nCalled back from medical studies in London , he gradually assumed a higher profile and six years later inherited the presidency when his father died after ruling Syria for 30 years . \nTo allow the 34-year-old to assume power , Syria 's parliament met hastily to amend a constitutional clause requiring the president to be at least 40 years old . \nIn office , he held out the prospect of reforming one of the Arab world 's most tightly controlled states and oversaw a short-lived move toward political freedoms before his `` Damascus Spring '' faded amid a wave of repression and arrests . \nAssad also strengthened his father 's strategic alliance with Iran and supported militant Islamist groups including the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah . \nHe ended nearly three decades of Syrian military presence in neighboring Lebanon under international pressure following the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri . \nBut the collapse in January of Beirut 's pro-Western government , led by Hariri 's son , was the latest sign that Assad had clawed back influence in Lebanon , one of only two countries to oppose Saturday 's Arab League move . \nAlthough he backs anti-Israel militants , he also pursued indirect peace talks with Israel and , despite continued Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , ensured the front line usually remained quiet . \nAt home he started liberalizing the economy , easing decades of central control and allowing limited foreign investment . \nBut while those around him , including his cousin Rami Makhlouf , acquired great wealth , ordinary Syrians saw few benefits . \nHe also maintained the grip on power held by his family and Alawite sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim state . \nHis brother Maher commands the Republican Guard and is the second most powerful man in the country while brother-in-law Assef Shawkat is deputy chief-of-staff of the armed forces . \nAssad 's wife Asma , who grew up in London and worked at an investment bank , helped him try to project a softer , liberal and modern image to the outside world , countering Syria 's reputation as a repressive police state . \nHe insists that he remains in touch with his people even after a decade in power and eight months of trying to crush a determined uprising . \n`` I live a normal life . \nI drive my own car , we have neighbors , I take my kids to school , '' he told the British Sunday Telegraph newspaper last month . \n`` That 's why I am popular .

'' \n`` I fell in love with Spain . \nIt was worth fighting for , '' he said , dapper and still sharp-minded at the age of 93 . \nLomon was captured by Italian troops during the Republican retreat of 1938 and spent several months in a prison camp until he was repatriatad . \n`` When I came back I decided I would carry on the fight . '' \nWith the outbreak of World War Two , he joined the Royal Navy and served on minesweepers in the English Channel and Asia . \nWatters , 98 , served with the Scottish Ambulance Unit . \nBorn in Alloa , he trained as a medic while working as a bus driver in Glasgow and his main motivation was to help people . \n`` I had to go . \nThere were many wounded . \nThey asked for volunteers and I had to do it . \nI was n't political , '' he told Reuters . \nHe was at the Battle of Jarama in February 1937 , where both sides suffered huge casualties . \nAfter two years in Spain , he returned to his job on the buses . \nLast week , the British government released intelligence files that said about 4,000 British and Irish men and women joined the anti-fascist fight , some 1,500 more than previously thought . \nAround 500 are known to have been killed . \nBritain 's MI5 spy agency kept records on them into the 1950s due to its fears of their possible communist links . \nAmong then were Eric Blair , better known as George Orwell , who wrote about his experiences in `` Homage to Catalonia '' , and author Laurie Lee . \nIn the decades since the conflict , it has become a reference point for many other foreign interventions and civil wars , particularly during the Central American wars of the 1980s . \nThis year British Labor Party leader Ed Miliband and Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd both evoked it when calling for international action in support of Libyan rebels . \nCuba 's Fidel Castro compared the NATO bombings to the German and Italian support for Franco . \nAnd as the anniversary nears , the war is still controversial in Spain , which has been wary of reopening old wounds . \nPeter Preston , regarded as the war 's leading historian , said in remarks at the ceremony organised by the International Brigade Memorial Trust that after the war , Franco `` brainwashed '' people into thinking he stood for freedom . \nRecent attempts to account for the thousands of dead from extra-judicial killings during and after the conflict had been stymied , he said , noting the removal from office by the conservative judiciary of investigating judge Baltasar Garzon . \n`` The struggle continues , '' Preston said , quoting the Republican rallying cry . \nStill , a Spanish diplomat attended the ceremony and praised the foreign veterans . \n`` Their solidarity , their generosity , their courage and their decency is an example to the younger generation , '' said Fidel Lopez Alvarez , cultural counsellor at the Spanish Embassy . \nIn 2007 , Spain passed a law giving citizenship to the veterans . \nLomon said he had received his passport two weeks ago . \n`` You deserve it , '' Lopez Alvarez told him . \n-LRB- Reporting by Angus MacSwan ; Editing by Michael Roddy ; -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` Retreat , you have no chance of beating this brave people , '' Gaddafi said . \n`` They can attack your homes , your offices and your families , which will become military targets just as you have transformed our offices , headquarters , houses and children into what you regard as legitimate military targets , '' he said . \nNATO announced it had stepped up strikes on Gaddafi forces in west Libya including the capital Tripoli , saying it had carried out more than 50 attacks since Monday . \nSpanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said the alliance stance was unchanged . \n`` Spain 's and the international coalition 's response is to maintain the unity and determination with which we have been working these past months , '' she said . \nLibyan rebels who had advanced to within 80 km of the capital were stopped in their tracks on Friday by a barrage of rocket fire from government forces , underlining the dogged resistance of Gaddafi troops to a five-month revolt .

'' \nBut there was also a shiver of fear that extremists who want Gaza to be an Islamic theocracy are bold enough to challenge Hamas over what they consider its lack of religious fervor . \nFriends and fellow pro-Palestinian activists said Arrigoni , a blogger , was well known in Gaza and well liked . \nHis captors , calling themselves Jihadist Salafi , saw him as an infidel who `` entered our land only to spread corruption . '' \nThey seized the 36-year-old to force Hamas to release their leader , Hesham al-Sa ` eedni , who was arrested last month and identified by Gaza sources as an Egyptian senior member of the Tawheed and Jihad group linked to al Qaeda . \nThis group denied responsibility , but observers said the message of the kidnappers bore all the hallmarks of the Jihadist Salafi and could be an autonomous cell of this movement . \n`` They knew Hamas was not going to agree to their demands and so they killed him in order to send a message , '' said political analyst Hani Habib . \n`` It is a sign of doubts over the security situation in Gaza and whether it is stable as Hamas says . '' \nHamas security forces arrested two men and were seeking others suspected of involvement , as senior figures in the movement scrambled to condemn an `` ugly crime '' totally alien to their beliefs and insist that Hamas 's grip remains intact . \nHamas , which has run the enclave since 2007 , said Arrigoni 's abductors `` had the intention to kill the Italian from the beginning , and the proof was that they had killed him hours after the announcement of their demands . '' \nInterrogation of one of the group disclosed the location where he was being held , but he was already dead . \nHabib believes radical splinter groups ready to defy Hamas are now competing to demonstrate who is the more extreme . \nHamas itself is an Islamist political movement which places religion at the center of its mission to end Israeli occupation of Palestinian land . \nHamas was founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood . \nAn Israeli security official , who did not wish to be named , said : `` We 've been watching these kind of challenges to Hamas for a while . \nThe obvious relevance to us is the question of whether Hamas is still in charge . '' \nBut for Israel , Hamas was still answerable for any violence from Gaza , and recent fighting in which at least 36 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in response to rocket fire `` made clear that it was in Hamas 's interest to assert order . '' \nThere are half a dozen radical Islamist groups in Gaza with membership numbering in the hundreds . \nThe differences between them are unclear . \nSome analysts believe they work in cells to evade Hamas pressure . \nAll want to end Western influence and establish an Islamic state across the Middle East . \nHamas wants a Palestinian state , albeit an Islamic one . \nIt has largely refrained from imposing Islamic law since taking control of Gaza in 2007 and has also condemned al Qaeda attacks in Western cities . \nHamas , with some 25,000 men under arms , has said its more radical rivals are simply misguided offered them `` re-education . '' \nPalestinian analyst Hani Masri said it was premature to say Hamas has lost control of Gaza . \n`` Such incidents can happen anywhere , '' he said . \nBut this would have an impact on Hamas . \n`` If Hamas is trying to show an image of moderation and could not get something in return from the international community , this will leave a vacuum for more radical groups , even within Hamas itself , '' Masri said . \nGeorge Giacaman , political analyst at Birzeit University in the West Bank , saw Arrigoni 's murder as `` a tremendous challenge for the authority of Hamas ... a huge embarrassment for them . '' \nThe movement , armed by Iran and shunned as a terrorist organization by the West , is trying `` to make their authority in Gaza acceptable for the Arabs and foreign countries , '' he said . \nIt had succeeded to a certain extent in stopping the firing of rockets and mortars into Israel over the past two years , and it would now be most intent on restoring control with rigor . \nBut there were risks attached to that course , he said . \nHamas forces in August 2009 killed 28 people , mostly Salafis , in the storming of a mosque where a radical cleric who supported al Qaeda surrounded himself with armed men and declared an Islamic emirate . \n`` They can not do that every day , '' Giacaman said . \n"}

{"id": "78", "time": "2011-08-16", "text": "Prime Minister David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street in London August 12 , 2011 . \nWITNEY , England | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 12:10 am BST WITNEY , England -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday promised a law and order `` fightback '' and robust action to mend what he called Britain 's broken society after riots and looting last week shocked Britons and tarnished its reputation abroad . \nBut he faced renewed questions over how far his plans to cut government spending may further alienate the young and the poor . \nIn a speech full of tough language likely to please his traditional Conservative supporters , Cameron vowed more `` no-nonsense policing '' and tougher sentencing to tackle gang culture and known troublemakers , and said he would to do more to promote families , boost discipline in schools and encourage hard work . \nIn north London , where riots began nine days ago , many welcomed his hard line -- but young people ushered in to hear his speech in rural Oxfordshire doubted it would do much to close a growing gap between rich and poor , or heal troubled communities facing his government 's deep public spending cuts . \n`` We have been too unwilling for too long to talk about what is right and wrong , '' Cameron said in a speech at a youth center in his mostly affluent constituency of Witney , near Oxford . \nMore than 2,800 people have been arrested since a protest over a fatal shooting by police on August 4 prompted rioting and looting in the poor London district of Tottenham . \nThat spread across the capital and sparked violence in other English cities . \nCameron , who returned from holiday abroad last week after days of unrest , is seeking to tap into widespread public anger over the violence . \nThey came 15 months after he took office at the head of a centre-right coalition committed to cuts in welfare and other spending that critics say will hit the poor . \n`` I think he 's right , '' Nicola Pastore , 26 , told Reuters as she pushed a pram in Tottenham . \n`` I do n't think the police have enough control . \nMy kids are scared to go to sleep at night . '' \nCameron , who faces criticism for plans to cut spending on police and for his management of the crisis , said the riots had been a `` wake-up call '' for Britain , whose reputation abroad was tarnished by the images of groups rampaging through its cities . \nBehind him as he spoke was a graffiti-style mural centred on characters in the kind of hoods and masks worn by many looters . \nThe stakes are high for Cameron . \nAny repeat of last week 's lawlessness , in which shops were smashed and set on fire and five people died , will sap public confidence in his government . \nHowever , analysts say the 44-year-old premier , a former public relations executive from a wealthy establishment background , could benefit politically if he provides the tough law and order response some voters are seeking . \nCameron has taken a hard line in rhetoric . \nHis speech on Monday talked of the dangers of indiscipline in schools and family breakdown , succor to traditional Conservatives who feel their young leader has been too liberal on social issues . \nCameron and his centre-left Liberal Democrat coalition partners will review their program over the coming weeks , looking at issues like welfare and substance addiction in an effort to promote more stable communities . \nBut the prime minister has ruled out easing spending cuts which some critics on the left say are fuelling tensions in Britain 's cities , where the gap between rich and poor is gaping . \nPlanned austerity has put Cameron on a collision course with the police , still smarting over his criticism of their initial response to the riots . \nPolice chiefs say a 20 percent cut in their budget over the next four years will make it harder for them to maintain law and order . \nLondon 's Conservative mayor , Boris Johnson , has also said now is not the time for cuts to spending on police . \nBut Cameron has refused to budge on plans to ease austerity measures , believing jittery financial markets will take fright at any sign of backtracking on plans to erase by 2015 a budget deficit that peaked at over 10 percent of national output . \nAt Witney Ecumenical Youth Trust , where Cameron gave his speech , young people questioned how spending cuts squared with his plans to deal with social problems , and felt his speech created even more of a sense of ` them and us ' . \nCameron was subjected to hostile whistling on arrival . \nAfter his televised speech , he took questions from journalists until a reporter chided him for not responding directly to young people in the audience . \nThe prime minister later left to the sounds of hecklers clucking like chickens to accuse him of cowardice . \n`` He tried putting it across like everyone who 's had a broken family was wrong . \nIt 's like he 's having a dig at us , '' said Jesse Day , 19 . \nShe and her friends stressed the importance of community organizations like theirs -- a charity which relies on donations and which almost closed a few months ago . \n`` He says he wants people to get in touch with their families . \nBut for some people , their families are n't there and the youth center 's the only people to talk to , '' said Ryan Clayton , 15 . \n`` But he 's shutting all the youth centres . '' \nOthers in Witney welcomed Cameron 's emphasis on behavior . \n`` I agree entirely , '' said 74-year-old Colin Bayliss . \n`` Discipline 's gone out the window . \nThe family identity has gone out the window . \nThere 's more single parents around . \nMore people need to take responsibility for their families and their children . '' \nOpposition Labor leader Ed Miliband said a lack of morality was not confined to a `` feral underclass '' but was also displayed by risk-taking bankers , legislators who fiddled their expenses and newspaper reporters who hacked telephones for stories -- all major topics of debate in Britain in the past couple of years . \n`` When we talk about the sick behavior of those without power , let 's also talk about the sick behavior of those with it , '' he said in a speech at his old school in London on Monday . \nIt was a line echoed by Cameron . \nLeaders are conscious that voters , disillusioned by what many see as a failure to punish bankers they hold responsible for the financial crisis , could take unkindly to being lectured by politicians , the press and police , all institutions hit by scandal in the recent past . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe country is finished -- besides you 'd better ask your mates in NewLieMore about the effects of their Rights for All policy -- their HRA giving rights to muggers , rapists , illegal immigrants who kill & get away scot free . \nAbout hijackers allowed to stay & no doubt given benefits ! \nAlso , why you were so soft on those thugs who looted , burned , murdered & rampaged through London & a number of other cities -- why YOU did n't use water cannon & rubber bullets -- instead let them get away with it . \nNo , matey , the UK is finished -- my kids WILL be leaving & I 'll buy them an air ticket ! \nI hope that David Cameron uses this opportunity with his coalition government to get really tough on law on order . \nMake life imprisonment exactly that , life imprisonment ! \nI would give these rioters lengthy jail terms and I would ensure that people who are a severe danger to society -LRB- murderers , rapists , child abusers -RRB- are jailed for life . \nWhile I make no excuses for what I call bad and criminal behavior , I do think that we need a global economy where there is hope . \nInstead , there is a strong risk of another recession which is something the world 's politicians need to get to grips with urgently . \nIs Cameron first nog going to ask Murdoch what he is allowed to say ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "202", "time": "2011-10-14", "text": "LONDON | Fri Oct 14 , 2011 10:39 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Europe faces a colder , dry winter in the north with milder , windy and wet weather in the south thanks to the effects of the dominant weather pattern , a leading energy weather forecaster told Reuters . \nA negative North Atlantic Oscillation -LRB- NAO -RRB- will continue to dominate the continent 's winter weather patterns , World Climate Service 's senior meteorologist Richard James said in an interview . \nCold weather combined with low wind and precipitation levels in northern Europe would mean that the vast wind power generation capacity along the North and Baltic Sea coasts would generate below average electricity during the high-demand winter season . \nLarge Scandinavian hydro-power reserves could freeze and fail to recover over the winter . \nWindy and wet weather in Spain and Portugal would mean ample wind and hydro power generation capacities on the Iberian Peninsula and in Italy . \n`` The NAO weather patterns will mean that hydro-power levels in northern Europe will be unlikely to re-charge this winter and that the North will see less wind than usual , '' James said . \n`` The South , by contrast , will be winder than usual , '' he added . \nThe United States-based WCS said it expected the coming winter to be dominated by a negative phase of the NAO , resulting in colder , dryer , and less windy than average weather on the British Isles , in France , Germany , and the Nordic and Baltic countries , while Mediterranean countries should expect a mild , windy and wet winter . \n`` We expect another winter of unusual cold and occasionally disruptive snow from the British Isles and France across Germany and southern Scandinavia to the Baltic states , '' James said . \nHe said that the winter was also likely to be `` front-heavy '' because the Pacific climate phenomenon La Nia had made an early appearance . \n`` The Pacific climate phenomenon 's El Nio and La Nia are connected to Europe , and La Nia has made an early appearance this season , leading to earlier cold weather in Europe , '' he said . \n`` The highest likelihood of unusual cold appears to be in early to mid-winter -LRB- late November to January -RRB- , with moderating conditions possible by February . \nWet conditions will prevail in southern and southeastern Europe , but it will be generally dry in the north . '' \nJames said the forecast had a high probability because nearly all indicators pointed in the same direction . \n`` Nearly all indicators point in the same direction and it is not usual to have everything lined up like that , and this also opens the possibility of even more extreme weather , '' he said . \nPrior to the past three years , the negative NAO weather pattern was last experienced in the 1960s , and usually occurs every 50 years but is not linked to climate change , James said , and added that the negative NAO could be a phenomenon that would dominate Europe 's winters for years to come . \n`` There are definitely decadal trends and there is a chance that there could be a long negative NAO phase , '' James said , and added : `` the last time we saw such a phase was in the 1950s and '60s , '' which was a period that dominated by cold winters in Europe . \n`` There definitely seems to be a correlation with low solar activity and a negative NAO , and it looks like the sun will be relatively inactive for a while , and that is bad news for European winters , '' he said . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council clashed with Russia and China on Friday by raising concerns about Syria and the looming specter of civil war during a closed-door meeting , council diplomats said . \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , several diplomats said the French , British , German and Portuguese envoys supported a statement issued on Friday by U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay , who called for international protection of civilians in Syria and warned of a possible civil war . \nSyrian forces shot dead at least six people protesting against President Bashar al-Assad on Friday , activists said , 10 days after Russia and China joined forces on a rare `` double veto '' to kill a European-drafted Security Council resolution that would have condemned Syria and hinted at possible future sanctions . \nFriday 's European push on Syria elicited an angry response from Russian deputy U.N. envoy Alexander Pankin , who complained that French Ambassador Gerard Araud was flouting normal procedure by introducing issues `` not on the agenda of the meeting , '' a diplomat present at the meeting told Reuters . \nThe Chinese envoy told the council that since Pillay 's remarks on Syria had not been requested by the Security Council , it should not take them into consideration , envoys said . \nThe closed-door council meeting followed the earlier adoption on Friday of two routine resolutions in public sessions . \nIts official agenda was a monthly review by the U.N. Department of Public Affairs on world affairs and conflicts . \nDuring the meeting , Araud told the council that `` the advocates of inaction on Syria should draw conclusions from the latest appalling developments , '' according to the French U.N. mission 's Twitter page . \nAraud was referring to Russia , China , Brazil , India and South Africa , the five `` BRICS '' emerging markets nations that have resisted the Western push for tough council action on Syria since the government crackdown against pro-democracy protesters began over half a year ago , diplomats said . \nPortuguese Ambassador Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral , one of the co-sponsors of last week 's failed resolution , confirmed he had said the council should revisit the idea of condemning Damascus . \n`` The situation -LRB- in Syria -RRB- is deteriorating fast , '' Cabral said . \n`` The council should come back to it .

{"id": "149", "time": "2011-08-27", "text": "BEIRUT | Sat Aug 27 , 2011 8:46 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi by Libyan rebels supported by NATO forces focuses international attention on the five months of unrest in Syria , which has shaken one of the most tightly controlled Arab states . \nOpposition figures and activists fear the successful use of force to topple Gaddafi may encourage Syrians to follow Libya 's example . \nSyrian protests have been mainly peaceful but there have been increasing reports of attacks on security forces . \nUpheaval in Syria would affect its allies and enemies in the volatile Middle East , and a softening in rhetoric from Arab countries this week indicated they might still be prepared to support President Bashar al-Assad if he implements reform . \nFollowing are some possible scenarios in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : The United Nations says 2,200 people have been killed in Assad 's crackdown on dissent since protests broke out in March . \nSyria says over 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed groups which it blames for the violence . \nDespite growing international condemnation , Western sanctions , and escalating economic pressures from the unrest , Assad 's rule shows no sign of imminent collapse . \nNor is there any indication that the protests across the country are about to stop , although the number of protesters appears to have fallen since Assad sent troops into several major cities earlier in August . \nIf Assad can not crush the protests completely , he may be able to contain their impact , staying in power despite the major upheaval and economic disruption caused by the unrest and growing international isolation . \nSTRIKING A DEAL WITH OPPOSITION Assad could reshuffle his ministers and bring in some opposition figures in a symbolic move that will not stop street demonstrations but may convince some that he is serious about reforms , including the promise of multi-party elections by February . \nAfter an apparently coordinated wave of criticism from regional powers including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Turkey earlier this month , Arab states have moderated their language in recent days , hinting at a possible easing of pressure on Assad . \nMany opposition figures have dismissed Assad 's promise of political reform and said they can not talk to the authorities while the violence continues . \nBut if the deadlock continues , some members of the fractured opposition may feel there is no alternative to negotiation , despite the chasm of mistrust between the two sides . \nSo far no country has proposed carrying out in Syria the kind of intervention undertaken by NATO forces to help Libyan rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi . \nBut the collapse of Gaddafi 's rule has encouraged some Syrian opposition figures and protesters to support international intervention in Syria , including the idea of a Turkish buffer zone in northern Syria . \nNATO help us , '' read one banner , in English , at a protest in the northern province of Idlib on Friday . \nBut any military intervention could destabilize a region in which Assad enjoys strong support from Iran and backs militant groups like Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . \n`` Any negative or bad development will affect the whole region , '' Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday . \nInternational intervention could also lead some Syrians to choose Assad over perceived foreign interference . \nAnalysts and some opposition activists have warned that the continuous killing may encourage people to take up arms in big numbers , pushing the country toward civil war . \n`` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . \nAssad belongs to the minority Alawite sect which makes up around ten percent of the Syrian population . \nMost of the demonstrations are taking place in Sunni Muslim areas . \nThere have been sectarian killings in some cities including Homs , but activists say so far it has been a minor part of the unrest . \nSyria suffered repeated coups in the 1960s before Assad 's father , Hafez al-Assad , seized power in 1970 and purged his opponents from positions of power . \nDespite reports of some low-level defections , and Assad 's replacement of his defense minister at the height of the military crackdown in August , the army has so far stood behind the president , unlike in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . \nBut some activists see little prospect of Assad being toppled by street demonstrations and see a military coup as the best chance of removing him . \nThey hope Western calls for Assad to step down and targeted sanctions against senior officials might encourage those around the president to break away or carry out a coup to avoid prosecution . \nIt is not clear how any new military leaders would deal with protesters ' demands for greater political freedoms . \nAttention has also focused on the wealthy merchant classes of Damascus and Aleppo which have made no public move yet to disassociate themselves from Assad . \nUnless they feel their interests would be protected in a post-Assad Syria , they would be reluctant to push for revolutionary change . \nBut their patience may be tested as the economy reels from the collapse of tourism revenues and foreign investment , loss of trade and a fall in manufacturing output . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and

'' \nAt 1.40 p.m. EDT -LRB- 1730 GMT -RRB- , Brent crude was down $ 3.95 at $ 106.65 a barrel , breaking below the 200-day moving average , a key technical indicator closely watched by traders . \nU.S. crude oil was down $ 5.40 , or 6 percent , at $ 83.18 a barrel . \nU.S. crude 's discount to Brent widened to about $ 24 a barrel . \nEarly pressure from disappointing U.S. weekly jobless claims and July home sales reports sparked a steep sell-off mid-morning . \nSelling then intensified after a report showed factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in August dropped to the lowest level since March 2009 . \nImplied volatility in the oil market soared , with the Chicago Board Options Exchange 's Oil Volatility Index hitting 54.23 percent , its highest level in more than a week and snapping a steady downtrend . \n`` The market is in meltdown mode ; the data continues to stink . \nI do n't know that there 's much more to be said . \nWe continue to be in a soft patch , '' said Sal Catrini , managing director for equities at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in New York . \nThe dollar rose and gold hit a new record of $ 1,825.99 an ounce as investors sought safe havens away from equities and industrial commodities . \nU.S. stocks tumbled 4 percent and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB , an index tracking 19 commodities , was down 2.4 percent in the steepest one-day loss since the U.S. credit downgrade earlier this month by Standard and Poor 's . \nAnalysts have revised down forecasts for fuel consumption in recent weeks as concerns about global growth rose , with Morgan Stanley the latest bank to cut its forecast for global gross domestic product in 2011 and 2012 . \nConcerned the European debt crisis might spread to U.S. banks , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has asked for more information about whether the U.S. units of big European lenders have reliable access to funds needed to operate , the Wall Street Journal reported . \nOil trading volumes rose back up toward the 30-day average after three days of relatively light trade at the start of this week . \nThe oil market is also closely watching developments in North Africa and the Middle East . \nIn Libya , where around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of crude production has been cut by a six-month civil war , rebel forces took control of a refinery and blocked a main highway , further isolating Muammar Gaddafi 's Tripoli stronghold . \nU.S. President Barack Obama banned U.S. imports of Syrian oil as part of sanctions against Amman , and joined the European Union in calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step down after a five-month crackdown on protesters . \nBrent prices are up by almost 13 percent so far in 2011 , in part because of the Libyan outage , but are almost $ 20 a barrel below the post-2008 peak they hit back in April as European refiners scrambled to find alternatives to Libyan supplies . \n`` What was announced today will have a very limited impact as it does n't really prevent anyone from outside the U.S. dealing with Syrian oil , '' said Greg Priddy , global oil analyst at Eurasia Group in Washington . \n`` With 95 percent of Syrian oil exports going to the EU , you might see more action there , '' he added . \nSyria produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day , exporting most of about 150,000 barrels per day to European countries including the Netherlands , Italy , France and Spain . \nAbout 10,000 barrels per day of Syrian oil products were exported to the United States in the first five months of 2011 , out of total imports of near 9 million bpd . \n"}

'' \nsaid Michael Hewson from CMC Markets , referring to Riyadh 's decision to supply more oil from June to compensate for the loss of Libyan crude and moderate prices . \nBoth Bank of Ireland 's Harris and David Kirsch , director of markets and country strategies at PFC Energy , said they would not rule out that Europe could also impose oil sanctions soon given the toughening of stance on Assad . \n`` Whether they are U.S.-based or not , oil firms are going to be very wary of crossing these sanctions , '' said Kirsch . \nMost U.S. companies have long stopped dealing with Syrian crude . \nU.S. firms such as ExxonMobil were also the first to walk away from Libyan oil dealings . \nFor international banks , the sanctions on Libya also made it difficult to finance export transactions involving Libyan crude . \nIn the case of Syria , the number of banks that are still providing export financing to firms dealing with Syrian oil has also shrunk grammatically in recent months , traders say . \nAssad has been condemned by many Arab neighbors and can count only on one firm ally - Iran , the world 's fourth-largest oil producer and itself subject to years of U.S. sanctions , although it still exports oil to Europe and Asia . \n`` The main sanctions -LRB- on Syria -RRB- that are starting to bite are really coming from Saudi Arabia , which has cut off support for Assad , '' Kirsch said . \n`` That 's going to push Assad closer to Iran for now -- they can provide him with the bullets he needs given how he 's chosen to deal with this rebellion , '' he added . \n"}

'' \nThe Scot has said the return of key players such as center back Rio Ferdinand has been like signing new players but with the added bonus that they already know how to play for the club . \nFerdinand , who started limping early in Tuesday 's 2-1 win at old trafford but battled on , was just one of several key figures who were outstanding in a team whose cohesion is growing . \nMexico striker Javier Hernandez , goal-poacher in chief , has been a revelation and his knack of netting at key moments has kept top scorer Dimitar Berbatov on the bench . \nWayne Rooney has gelled better with Hernandez than Berbatov and seems to be revelling in a deeper position behind the Mexican that is proving very effective . \n`` He -LRB- Rooney -RRB- is enjoying the position he 's playing in at the moment because it has given him a lot of freedom to use his energy , in that position you do need energy , '' Ferguson told a news conference after Tuesday 's victory . \nIn the first leg Rooney was given too much space and scored the only goal of the game , and while Chelsea changed their shape to try to restrict him in the return leg he still pulled the strings and used his eye for a long ball to devastating effect . \nSimilarly effective has been the evergreen Ryan Giggs , who was involved in all three of his team 's goals in the tie , a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact he is now 37 . \nGiggs knows what it feels like to win the treble and that could be key as United seek success in the Champions League , Premier League and FA Cup . \n`` His experience and composure are vital , '' Ferguson said of the Welshman . \n`` He 's just a unique person and player . \n`` He 's lucky , in the sense he 's got a physique that does n't carry any weight , he 's got fantastic balance ... He looks after himself . \nTo play at 37 years of age there must be tremendous sacrifice to do that .

{"id": "287", "time": "2011-04-25", "text": "PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An authoritarian Arab ruler unleashes his security forces and irregular militia gunmen to crush peaceful pro-democracy protests , killing hundreds of people including women and children . \nDoes the West a -RRB- issue statements condemning the excessive use of force ; b -RRB- seek U.N. sanctions and an International Criminal Court investigation ; c -RRB- provide practical support for pro-democracy protesters , d -RRB- intervene militarily ? \nThe answer , to many human rights campaigners , seems to vary unacceptably depending on the state concerned . \nWestern powers which took up arms against Muammar Gaddafi in Libya , citing the United Nations principle of the responsibility to protect civilians , have confined themselves so far to verbal outrage at the killing of some 350 people in Syria . \nThe balance of Western economic and security interests and humanitarian values is different in each case but the perceived double standard is causing anger in the Middle East and among Western publics . \n`` After Friday 's carnage , it is no longer enough to condemn the violence , '' Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director at pressure group Human Rights Watch , said in a statement . \n`` Faced with the Syrian authorities ' ` shoot to kill ' strategy , the international community needs to impose sanctions on those ordering the shooting of protesters . '' \nWhen the Gulf Arab kingdom of Bahrain called in Saudi troops last month to help quash a pro-democracy movement led mostly by the Shi'ite Muslim majority , the United States and Europe uttered a few pro-forma words of disapproval , then fell silent . \nThe killing in Bahrain was on a smaller scale than in Libya or Syria , and the ensuing arrests , dismissals and disappearances of opponents have drawn less media coverage . \nMore importantly , Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet , which keeps an eye on Shi'ite Iran across the Gulf and patrols the world 's most vital oil-export sea lanes . \nThe ruling family in the Gulf island state is so close to former colonial power Britain that the crown prince was invited to this week 's royal wedding in London until he declined the invitation to spare British embarrassment . \nThere are strategic , political and practical reasons behind divergent Western responses to events in Syria , Libya and Yemen , after the initially hesitant Western embrace of democratic change in Tunisia and Egypt . \n`` All of these situations are different , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on BBC television when questioned about apparent inconsistency . \n`` So we must n't think that just because we 're doing certain things in Libya , that we would be able or willing to do those things in other countries of the Arab world . '' \nHague said that in Libya , there was a direct appeal for help from the opposition and the Arab League had asked the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution and to take action for a no fly zone . \nWestern governments say they prevented an imminent massacre that Gaddafi had threatened to unleash in Benghazi . \nGaddafi had lost control of more than a third of his country and his armed forces were brittle and poorly equipped . \nBy contrast , Syria has a well-trained army with Russian missiles and combat aircraft , and suspected chemical weapons , making any Western military intervention utterly implausible . \nA key strategic consideration is that the West is keen to ensure that Arab uprisings , and the rulers ' responses , do not destabilize the entire Middle East , threatening oil supplies to the industrialized world or triggering wider conflict . \nOil has already risen to nearly $ 125 a barrel from around $ 80 last year , partly due to a drop in Libyan supply but also because Saudi Arabia has cut back output , forcing prices up . \nRiyadh 's move is seen partly as driven by the need to fund huge hand-outs promised by King Abdullah to interest groups to pre-empt any possible unrest in his absolute monarchy . \nIt may also reflect tension between Saudi Arabia and Washington . \nSome diplomats say Saudi rulers were incensed by the way U.S. President Barack Obama dropped Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , a veteran pro-American stalwart in the region . \nSince the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq , the United States ' priority in the region has been to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapons capability which Western and Arab strategists say would be profoundly destabilizing . \nSyria is Iran 's closest ally and Western powers have been trying for the last two years to woo President Bashar al-Assad away from Tehran and encourage the British-trained eye doctor to reach a peace deal with Israel that could remove a major source of regional friction . \nAfter years of unsuccessfully trying to corner Syria over the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , the United States sent an ambassador back to Damascus this year . \nFrance appointed a special envoy last summer to facilitate back channel contacts between Syria and Israel , and Turkey , Spain and Germany have also been involved in passing messages , diplomats say . \nIf the West seeks a Security Council condemnation of Assad or a referral of the repression to the ICC , Russia , an historic ally of Libya , may well veto any resolution . \nWestern diplomatic action could push Syria more tightly into the arms of Iran and risk retaliation by Syrian-allied Hezbollah forces in Lebanon either against Israel or European troops policing a southern Lebanese buffer zone . \nWestern diplomats say they are also concerned at the risk of sectarian conflict in Syria , dominated for nearly five decades by an Alawite minority close to Shi'a Islam . \nViolence involving Sunni Arabs , Alawites , Kurds and Druze could embroil neighboring Turkey , Lebanon and Iraq . \nSo while Western governments are likely to step up rhetoric against Assad and explore the scope for targeted U.N. sanctions and an ICC referral , there is little they can do to affect the outcome of the popular uprising . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWar there would likely set off a general regional war , with potentially catastrophic consequences considering the nuclear weapons on both sides . \nThere is always trouble in the Middle east . \nApr 25 , 2011 11:43 am EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

As the scorching summer approaches , tourism officials are hoping for a pick-up in business from September . \nBut that depends on the security situation , said Brigadier Mohammad Al-Mogati , the Arab League 's assistant for tourism security . \nPolitical unrest has waned , but army vehicles can still be see on some streets and embassies are now warning citizens against an increase in muggings , robberies and racketeering in Egypt . \nWar is also raging in neighboring Libya . \nIn Sharm , which hardly saw a whiff of the protests that shook the capital and other cities , glum-faced souvenir merchants idle outside empty shops along an almost deserted walkway at Naama Bay and in the Old Town market . \nSecurity has been tight at Egypt 's busiest Red Sea resort since a series of bombings by Islamist militants in 2005 killed over 80 people , most of them Egyptians , and wounded hundreds . \nPolice and security guards patrol resorts , using metal detectors and airport-style x-ray machines to search those entering . \nMubarak , who turned the town into a major tourist attraction , is now in Sharm 's hospital . \nSome residents say his presence in the resort had become a liability . \n`` Tourists come to Sharm to have a good time , '' said Galal Shabaan , a 33-year-old shop owner . \n`` You ca n't relax with Mubarak around and the spectre of protests hanging over Sharm . '' \nDespite an increasingly grim picture , Hala el-Khatib , secretary general of the Egyptian Hotels Association , said nationwide , hotel occupancy was only down by 15 percent in April compared to the same month a year ago . \nShe said hotel occupancy in Sharm had recovered to 32 percent by mid-April from an abysmal 11 percent after the protests erupted on January 25 . \nBut it was still a far cry from the 75 percent rate hotels in the resort are accustomed to at this time of year . \nStill , Khatib remains optimistic , and says landmarks of the revolution such as Cairo 's Tahrir Square , which became internationally renowned as the gathering place of the protests , are featuring on some tourist itineraries . \n`` Security is getting better day by day . \nPeople have a different view of Egypt , they have a more positive view . \nThey want to include Tahrir in their program , '' she said . \n"}

'' \nThat was an apparent reference to the suppression of anti-government protests in Iran , the biggest since the 1979 Islamic revolution , that erupted after a disputed 2009 presidential election . \nTens of thousands of people had taken to the streets of cities across Syria in the biggest demonstrations to sweep the country so far , and called for the `` overthrow of the regime . '' \nThat reflected the hardening of demands which initially focused on reforms and greater freedoms . \nThe protests went ahead despite Assad 's lifting of the state of emergency the day before . \nEnding the hated emergency rule , in place since the Baath Party seized power 48 years ago , was a central demand of demonstrators , who also seek the release of political prisoners and dismantling of the security services . \n`` This was the first test of the seriousness of authorities -LRB- toward reform -RRB- and they have failed , '' activist Ammar Qurabi said . \nWashington urged Syria to stop the violence against protesters and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said emergency law should be `` lifted in practice not just in word . '' \nFriday 's violence brings the death toll to about 300 , according to rights activists , since the unrest which broke out on March 18 in the southern city of Deraa . \nActivists cited the highest toll in the nearby village of Izra'a where protesters had been trying to head for Deraa . \nResidents said 14 people were killed . \n`` Izra'a is in the dark . \nNo mobile phones or landlines working . \nPeople have been talking from villages near to Izra'a but not in the town , '' said Wissam Tarif of human rights organization , Insan . \nSyrian television said eight people were killed and 28 wounded , including army personnel , in attacks by armed groups in the village . \nIt added an armed group had attacked a military base in the Damascus suburb of Muadhamiya . \nAmnesty International said it had been told of 75 deaths , including two children and a 70-year-old man . \nMalcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa director , urged the authorities to stop the violence : `` They must also immediately launch an independent investigation into what happened and ensure that any security forces found to have carried out these killings are brought to justice . '' \nAs in the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings , citizens are rebelling against both a lack of freedom and opportunity and security forces ' impunity and corruption that has enriched the elite while one-third of Syrians live below the poverty line . \nIn the first joint statement since the protests broke out , the activists coordinating the demonstrations Friday demanded the abolition of the Baath Party monopoly on power and the establishment of a democratic political system . \nAided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus , Assad , 45 , has absolute power in Syria . \nProtests swept the country of 20 million people , from the Mediterranean city of Banias to the eastern towns of Deir al-Zor and Qamishli . \nIn Damascus , security forces fired teargas to disperse 2,000 protesters in the district of Midan . \nIn Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in 1982 , a witness said security forces opened fire to prevent protesters reaching the Baath Party headquarters . \n`` We saw two snipers on the building . \nNone of us had weapons . \nThere are casualties , possibly two dead , '' said the witness . \nSyria 's third city Homs , where security forces had killed 21 protesters this week when demonstrators tried to gather at a main square , was not spared Friday either . \n`` I was in the center of Homs and in front of me I heard a security commander telling his armed men : ` Do n't spare them -LRB- protesters -RRB- , ' '' rights campaigner Najati Tayara told Reuters . \nWitnesses said security forces also shot at protesters in the Damascus district of Barzeh and the suburb of Douma . \nAl Jazeera showed footage of three corpses , wrapped in white burial shrouds , which it said were from the eastern Damascus suburb of Zamalka . \nAhead of the main weekly prayers Friday , which have often turned out to be launch pads for major demonstrations , the army deployed in Homs and police put up checkpoints across Damascus , apparently trying to prevent protests sweeping in from suburbs . \nAfter prayers finished in Deraa , several thousand protesters gathered chanting anti-Assad slogans . \n`` The Syrian people will not be subjugated . \nGo away doctor -LRB- Assad -RRB- . \nWe will trample on you and your slaughterous regime , '' they shouted . \nAssad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , usually followed by an intense crackdown . \nActivists said some funerals for those killed Friday took place in Damascus suburbs in the evening . \nFunerals have been another platform for protesters in recent weeks and security forces have opened fire when mourners started demonstrating . \nThe authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . \nWestern and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey want the nation broken into cultural enclaves protected by small militias . \nNational boundaries in North Africa have got to go , they are a stranglehold on multi-cultural needs . \nThe Bathist party is among the most ruthless in history and this al-assad junior is no better than his father . \nThey try to mask their identities with degrees and overseas educations , but unfortunately , you can take them out of the gutter but you cant take the gutter out of them . \nEven more sad in the region is that without these ruthless dictators , you would have complete anarchy in the streets . \nToo many different sects\\/tribes and interests . \nEveryone in the region is worried about their personal benefit first and not that of the common good . \nThe Middle East is a hopeless cause and the sooner we pull out the more we can focus on our own problems here . \nTaking out these monkeys will only create larger struggles for power which will lead to more dictators and more bloodshed . \nJust let these people alone and if they kill themselves , than that is their chosen fate . \nThe Arab Spring to democracy must be worrying to Israel which depends on Arab tyrannies and the anti-Israel threat they pose militarily to keep Israel from descending into civil war . \nWithout enemies that is almost certain to happen in Israel , especially if the Arab Spring Democracy Movement also gains hold and wins in the Palestinian territories , leaving only Iran as the big threat unless democracy also takes control in Persia . \nWith that scenario in mind , I wonder what plans the United States has in place to deal with a potential new reality which will see its allied countries like Saudi Arabia and other oil producing sheikdoms the only major anti-democratic and anti-Israel tyrannies left in the region . \nThe next six to 36-months may reshape everything including Israel and the way it governs

'' \nThere are some signs that would appear to suggest Europe 's strategy is working . \nDespite an escalation of the euro zone crisis over the past few weeks which has pushed bond yields on Europe 's periphery to record highs , the euro has risen to 16-month highs against the dollar . \nBut that has been driven more by expectations of further interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank than any sense that Europe is closer to solving its crisis . \nThe bloc 's biggest conundrum is Greece , a country whose sovereign debt levels are forecast to rise to 160 percent of annual output over the coming years , on a par with Zimbabwe . \nPrivate economists have been saying for months that this debt mountain is unsustainable , but some policymakers in Europe appear only now to be waking up to that fact . \nThe immediate dilemma they face is that the blueprint for their future financial safety net , the European Stability Mechanism -LRB- ESM -RRB- , which is due to be established in mid-2013 , does not give them the flexibility they need to deal swiftly and cleanly with the Greek debt problem . \nThe root of the problem can be traced back to a deal on the ESM struck in Deauville , France last October between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy . \nThat deal foresaw private debt holders sharing in the pain of future debt restructurings . \nBut as markets grew nervous in the weeks that followed , Germany backtracked and pushed back the threat of `` haircuts '' until 2013 . \nThat move now looks misguided . \nBy postponing the real pain until 2013 , the bloc has guaranteed that the threat of a tough restructuring will hang over it like a dark cloud for at least two more years , hurting not only market sentiment towards Greece but also Ireland , Portugal , Spain and possibly others . \nAs Greece 's outstanding bonds mature , the EU and the IMF are pumping money into Greece by extending it emergency loans under the country 's 110 billion euro bailout deal . \nSo when 2013 rolls around , European authorities and the IMF are expected to hold more than half of Greece 's total debt . \nIf they then restructured Greek debt to return the country to a sustainable debt path , they would have to impose an aggressive haircut on themselves . \nAnd even after that , Greece might still need support from other European governments , probably for years . \nThe only obvious way to avert this explosive scenario is for Europe to renege on its pledge and hit investors in Greek bonds now , accepting the risk of deterring investment in other countries ' bonds . \n`` The easiest way out would be to do the restructuring soon , '' said Charles Grant , head of the Centre for European Reform in London . \n`` Hit the private creditors and recapitalise the banks . \nIt may still happen . '' \nThe wild card remains public opinion and politics . \nIn Germany , the junior partner in Merkel 's coalition is vowing to defend parliament 's right to veto ESM payments . \nSome lawmakers in the Bundestag want to block approval of the creation of the ESM altogether . \nThe new mechanism is also running into trouble in Slovakia . \nIn Finland , the True Finns party has suggested that a meeting of finance ministers in mid-May to approve a bailout for Portugal could end up producing an `` entirely different '' solution . \nEurope has seen off political challenges to bailouts in the past ; when Slovakia balked at approving plans for the bloc 's current financial safety net last year , bigger countries pressured it into line . \nBut in the current climate , such pressure may not be so forthcoming . \nThere are no obvious alternatives to a bailout for Portugal , which has said it will run out of funding by June if no bailout is agreed . \nBut the message that the True Finns are sending out -- that taxpayer-funded bailouts are proving costly failures -- could begin to resonate among European leaders at some point . \nIn Germany there is an expression `` Augen zu und durch , '' which loosely translated means : `` Close your eyes , continue down your path and hope for the best .

{"id": "315", "time": "2011-04-22", "text": "BEIRUT | Fri Apr 22 , 2011 12:12 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Bashar al-Assad is in a quandary as the challenge to his autocratic rule grows in the streets of Syria : more concessions could signal weakness , but harsher repression risks radicalizing a growing opposition . \nWhile some analysts believe Assad can contain the revolt through bold reforms , others believe he missed the chance to open up Syria 's dictatorship when he inherited the presidency from his strongman father , the late Hafez al-Assad , in 2000 . \n`` The regime is in trouble . \nPeople have been repressed for 40 years but suddenly the wall of fear has crumbled and they are no longer frightened , '' Sarkis Naoum of Beirut 's an-Nahar newspaper told Reuters . \n`` Each time the regime makes new concessions , the people get bolder and ask for more . \nThey see it as a sign of weakness . \nThe regime does n't know how to respond -- it 's like an old grudge people have been waiting to avenge . '' \nClose observers of Syria argue that -- as in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions that ousted Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- citizens are rebelling not just against a lack of freedom and opportunity . \nThey are also enraged by suffocating corruption that has enriched the elites while one-third of Syrians live below the poverty line . \n`` It was a combination of repression , corruption , incompetence and the degeneration of the system , '' says analyst Jamil Mroue . \n`` It became combustible and people suffocated . '' \nWhile crackdowns continued against activists who challenged Baath party rule , economic reforms since 2005 created lucrative new monopolies controlled by senior officials and Assad family insiders , among them his billionaire cousin Rami Makhlouf . \n`` The Baath Party is ancient , outdated and obsolete . \nThe decisions are being made by the security forces and services who play a fundamental role in the country . \nThey are the real force , '' said Talal Salman , publisher of Beirut 's as-Safir daily , traditionally sympathetic to Syria . \nA caste of army officers and clans of the dominant Alawite minority has sprung up , using its clout to suppress dissent and extort kickbacks , often demanding a share of the profits private business generates , observers said . \n`` The essential spark was ignited by the privatizing and franchising of corruption , which along with repression violated the fabric of society , '' Mroue said . \nAs with their Arab peers from Egypt to Yemen and Libya , young Syrians ' aspirations have risen in tandem with their access to satellite TV , mobile phones , Facebook and the Internet . \nThe regional explosion that began in Tunisia and Egypt propelled people to seek a new way of life . \nWhat adds an edge to Syria 's crisis is the heavy-handedness of one-party rule , the sectarian rift between the ruling Alawite minority and the Sunni majority , and the brutality and impunity of the security forces . \nFacing the most alarming challenge of his 11 years in power , Assad has juggled repression , economic handouts and calibrated concessions in an attempt to quash a month of protests . \nYet the unrest , which rights groups say has cost more than 200 lives , shows no signs of going away without radical change . \nOn Thursday , ahead of mass protests that broke out again on Friday , Assad ended a draconian state of emergency , in place for 48 years , that allowed blanket repression with impunity . \n`` President Assad might be able to overcome this crisis and contain the situation but the cost may be high ... He has to change the regime or the people will force him to , '' said Salman . \nAnalysts say toppling the system is harder because Syria 's power structure differs from that of Egypt and Tunisia , where senior generals refused to open fire on demonstrators . \nAlawite loyalists occupy the key positions in the Syrian military and Assad family insiders run the crucial security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . \nYet the bulk of the army is Sunni and there have been persistent but unconfirmed reports of soldiers refusing to fire on protesters . \n`` There is a big possibility that the army will split or they wo n't accept to take part in a crackdown , if ordered . \nIt is not easy to bring the regime down but it is easy to divide the regime , '' An-Nahar 's Naoum said . \nNearly 30 years ago , the elder Assad ruthlessly put down an armed Islamist uprising , killing tens thousands of people in the city of Hama in a bombardment cloaked from international view . \nThat level of brutality would be harder to get away with today , when Syrians , despite state curbs on media , use mobile phone cameras to post instant images of protests on YouTube . \n`` Bashar 's father killed 20,000 to 30,000 people in Hama ... If Bashar wants to do another Hama in the first two hours the whole world will rise up , '' Naoum said . \nWhile holding Assad responsible for failing to enact sweeping reforms , some analysts say issues beyond his control played a role , although he should have addressed them faster . \nThe country has been plagued by drought for several years , slowing its rise as a middle income economy . \nSyria has 20 million people with a population growth rate of 2.4 percent . \nBut entrants to the labor market are increasing at double that pace due to a faster birth rate in earlier decades , that far outstrips the capacity of the economy to create jobs . \nPer capita gross domestic product languishes at $ 2,500 a year . \nThe official unemployment rate stands at 10 percent but independent estimates are double that , with about a quarter of a million youngsters arriving in the jobs market every year . \nSome Syrians believe the protest movement , unthinkable a few months ago , has now gained an irreversible momentum . \n`` There is n't anything impossible any more after Egypt and Tunisia , '' said a Syrian who refused to give her name . \n`` Seeing Syrians defying the security forces on the streets while knowing that they might be shot dead is something beyond imagination . \n`` Do you think these people are willing to die just for some reforms or for an increase in wages ? \nThese people want the Assad regime out , '' she added . \nEven if Assad , 45 , concedes far-reaching democratic reforms , activists and protesters will want proof that he is making a real break with the past , testing the president 's power over his own family and the Baathist elite . \n`` Assad has to carry out a white coup to clean his entourage of corrupt figures linked to the regime , '' Mroue said . \n`` He has to show people that there is dramatic change , that there will be elections in a few years , that he wo n't be president for life , that it is no longer a dynasty . '' \nSuch a high-risk course would entail confronting his own entourage and ditching a structure in place for 40 years . \nNo one knows what might come next -- a peaceful transition of power , a military coup , prolonged instability or civil war . \n`` Either he will opt for transformation of the regime or it will be torn apart , '' Mroue said . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey want the nation broken into cultural enclaves protected by small militias . \nNational boundaries in North Africa have got to go , they are a stranglehold on multi-cultural needs . \nThe outlook is dim in Syria , but the Syrian protesters do mean business and they are impressive . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "114", "time": "2011-08-26", "text": "LONDON | Fri Aug 26 , 2011 10:04 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The government needs to relax its hold on power and allow English cities to jump-start their local economies after inner-city rioting spread across the country this month , former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine said . \nSeeking a response to the worst urban violence for decades , commentators and politicians have looked back to 1981 when Heseltine led efforts to tackle deprivation in the northern English city of Liverpool that had sparked similar unrest . \nHeseltine , now 78 , garnered praise for his efforts to promote private investment in a city struggling for an identity after its port went into decline , causing mass unemployment . \nLiverpool 's regenerated Albert Dock , home to a branch of the Tate Art Gallery and a Beatles museum , is one project that has brought lasting benefits to the city . \nThirty years on , many English cities still look to national government to solve their problems , something that Heseltine wants to change . \nFew city mayors are directly elected and councils get much of their funding from central grants , leaving them exposed to deep state spending cuts . \nHeseltine is widely seen in the Conservative Party as a politician close to the thinking of Prime Minister David Cameron and one with a particular grasp of the problems of inner cities . \nHe believes Cameron 's Conservative-led coalition government has done the right thing with its initial hardline response to the riots , flooding the streets with police and arresting around 3,000 people . \n`` You have got to regain the streets . \nThat they have done and rightly so , '' Heseltine said in an interview . \n`` It would be for example a tragedy if the Notting Hill carnival was not to go ahead and be peacefully conducted , '' he added , referring to this weekend 's African-Caribbean festival in London , one of the biggest street parties in Europe . \nPrime Minister David Cameron had already asked Heseltine and former Tesco supermarket boss Terry Leahy , who is from Liverpool , to produce an updated development plan for the city . \nThat report is sure to be required reading for those seeking to ease the plight of England 's inner cities . \nRelations with prime ministers have not always been so cordial . \nHeseltine , a millionaire magazine publisher , was one of the most talented politicians of his generation but his dominant personality and centrist leanings made for combustible relations with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . \nHe stormed out of government in 1986 in a row over the ownership of a defense firm . \nHis leadership challenge in 1990 helped to end Thatcher 's reign but the more emollient John Major piped him to become party leader and prime minister . \nNow retired from front line politics , Heseltine says there is no quick fix after looting of shops and arson attacks spread from London to other major English cities , leaving five people dead , businesses in ruins and damaging Britain 's image abroad . \nHe is careful not to telegraph the conclusions of his report on Liverpool , but he believes the centralised government and the dominance of London , home to the financial services industry , is holding the country back . \n`` We are the only country of our sort that runs virtually everything from the center , if you look at all the other major economies they have very powerful devolved and therefore competitive economies , '' he said . \nBritain 's deficit-cutting government talks about rebalancing the economy -- helping to nurture high-tech manufacturing and spreading growth more evenly geographically . \nPlans to create low-tax , light-regulation enterprise zones echo the Heseltine prescription of the 1980s . \nHeseltine said large English cities like Liverpool , Manchester , Newcastle and Birmingham needed strong local leaders to complement this approach . \n`` They do n't have people who have the power to take real decisions and give proper leadership , '' he said , applauding government plans to allow larger English cities to directly elect their mayors . \nHe notes that London 's high profile mayor Boris Johnson has very limited powers , making him more of a figurehead . \nIn an illustration of London 's problems , the interview was conducted by telephone , with the Reuters correspondent in Heseltine 's office in the district of Hammersmith surrounded by racks of his firm 's magazines and the ex-minister stranded in snarled traffic and unable to get to the appointment in person . \nThatcher was famously dismissive of Heseltine 's contribution to urban renewal , noting acidly in her memoirs that `` Liverpool has defeated better men than Michael Heseltine .

'' \nBoth sets of races are a big spectacle and bring thousands of people to the river for four days of rowing mayhem , dinners , picnics , parties , BBQs and bonfires . \nThe races are conducted in boats with crews of eight who chase each other down the river intent on overtaking to `` bump '' the crew ahead . \nCrashes , sinkings and even rowers knocked out of boats are regular occurrences . \nBankside , cyclists race along the towpaths screaming support for their teams , so watch out ! \nCycle out across Midsummer Common to the towpath to see the rowing or just look at the lovely college boathouses perched on the banks , with their escutcheons proudly displayed . \nForemost of these is Goldie Boathouse -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , where the Cambridge University team conduct their indoor training . \nIf you 're lucky , the doors will be open and a number of scantily clad top athletes will be getting put through their paces . \n12 p.m. Hit the pub . \nThe riverside pubs in Cambridge are gorgeous on a fair day and filled with rowers . \nMost have outdoor seating and serve food . \nOne of the oldest is the Fort St. George , right on the banks of the Cam . \nJust up the road is the Old Spring . \nFurther along the river heading out of town towards Ely are the Green Dragon and about an hour 's cycle is The Bridge at Waterbeach . \nIf you 've gone to the Bridge at Waterbeach then you 'll have to cycle back into town . \nAfter a big lunch and a few pints it might take longer than expected . \nDo n't rush , the river outside of town is surrounded by picturesque countryside and home to herons , ducks , swans and kingfishers . \nSheep and horses can sometimes be seen grazing in fields by the bank . \n3 p.m. Do n't abandon the river just yet . \nAfter all the excitement of the rowing and hours in the saddle , it 's time for you to get on the Cam yourself for a glorious introduction to the gardens and architecture in Cambridge . \nThe river wends its way through the middle of town and around the back of some of the university 's oldest colleges . \nThe best way to drink it in is from a traditional punt on the river . \nThere are any number of hire companies , but one of the biggest is Scudamore 's -LRB- www.scudamores.com -RRB- . \nFeel free to attempt punting -- propelling the traditional flat-bottomed wooden boat using a wooden pole -- yourself . \nBut beware that it 's a hilarious past-time for locals to snigger at the hapless tourists who end up spluttering in the river when their pole becomes stuck and their punt slides out from under them . \nA more relaxing way to see the college `` Backs '' is to hire a chauffeur , often a student , who will propel you along regaling you with the history of the colleges while you laze in the punt eating strawberries and cream , drinking Pimm 's and enjoying the blooming gardens and the serene beauty all around you . \n6 p.m. Drop into the Granta pub overlooking the Mill Pond or The Mill for a swift pint or two after your punting and before you get changed for dinner . \nThere are a number of good restaurants for fine dining in Cambridge and of course , plenty of pubs . \nFor the pub option take your pick of the pubs reviewed by Cambridge Pubs , with a map and descriptions at www.cambridge-pubs.co.uk . \nCambridge has a number of good fine dining options . \nMidsummer House Restaurant -LRB- www.midsummerhouse.co.uk -RRB- has two Michelin stars and is located right on the river on Midsummer Common next to the Fort St. George pub . \nIt is set in a converted Victorian house serving French Mediterranean food . \nCotto restaurant -LRB- www.cottocambridge.co.uk -RRB- has n't the Michelin stars but boasts that it uses only the freshest ingredients sourced locally . \nHotel Du Vin -LRB- www.hotelduvin.com\\/HotelLanding.aspx ?

Security Council sanctions on Syria for its bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators is meeting fierce resistance from Russia and China , U.N. diplomats said . \nThe United States , Britain , France , Germany and Portugal have circulated a draft resolution that calls for sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , influential members of his family and close associates . \nThey say they want to put it to a vote as soon as possible . \nThe measures are not as severe as U.S. sanctions in place and a proposed expansion of European Union steps against Damascus that would forbid the import of Syrian oil . \nDiplomats said there were no plans for a vote yet . \nRussia 's U.N. ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , has hinted that Moscow would use its veto power to knock down the draft if it were put to a vote at the current time . \nWestern diplomats said Russia and China were refusing to discuss the draft . \n`` The Russians say they have no instructions , '' a diplomat told Reuters on Friday on condition of anonymity . \nAs a result , Western diplomats in New York said their capitals would have to get involved to persuade Moscow and Beijing to join negotiations on the draft resolution to reach a consensus among the 15 Security Council members . \n`` Clearly we need this to be unlocked at the capital level because there is very strong resistance from Russia and China , '' a diplomat said . \nBrazil , India and South Africa have also been reluctant to sanction -- or even condemn -- Syria , whose five-month crackdown on demonstrators has killed at 2,200 , according to U.N. figures from earlier this week . \nBut one diplomat said the three countries , all of which aspire to become permanent members of an expanded Security Council , were now `` constructively engaging on the text . '' \nRussia on Friday proposed putting to a vote a rival resolution it has drafted on Syria , but one Western envoy described it as `` toothless '' and unlikely to get the support of the United States and Europeans . \nThe Russian text , obtained by Reuters , did not call for sanctions or other punitive measures , simply urging Syrian authorities to speed up their proposed reforms , and the opposition to engage in dialogue with the government . \nU.S. mission spokesman Mark Kornblau said the Security Council should respond to the Syrian government 's continuing violence . \n`` The draft resolution that we have put forward is the right basis for this response , '' he said . \nThe council had scheduled an informal closed-door meeting of ambassadors on the draft sanctions resolution on Thursday afternoon , but the Chinese and Russian envoys boycotted the meeting , diplomats said . \n`` You see two permanent members of the Security Council who deliberately leave an empty chair , '' a diplomat said . \n`` We hope that they will engage constructively . '' \nEarlier this week , Churkin told reporters it was not the time to sanction Syria . \nAfter months of helping block any council action on Syria , Russia and China had backed an August 3 statement by the Security Council that condemned the government 's crackdown and called for it to end . \nRussia , China , Brazil , India and South Africa have repeatedly complained that the NATO intervention in Libya has gone far beyond the U.N. mandate approved by the council in March to protect civilians from violence by the government . \nThey say they do not want the same thing to happen in Syria . \nRussia has long had close ties to Syria and is one of its main arms suppliers . \nOne of the proposed sanctions is an arms embargo , which would make it illegal for Russian firms to sell weapons to Damascus . \nThe sanctions would impose a travel ban on 22 of Assad 's relatives and associates and an asset freeze on 23 Syrians , including Assad . \nEnvoys said Assad was excluded from the travel ban in order to give him an escape route . \n`` We want him to leave the country , '' a diplomat said . \nThe United States and EU have urged Assad to step down . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHas Washington and western Europe lost their minds ? \nThey think that after Libya 's destruction Russia , China and global community would allow this to happen to Syria . \nJust because these are smaller countries with out much influence , their being bossed around . \nHow can anyone at UNSC vote for another sanction , after what happened to UN Resolution 1973 on Libya ? \nHumanitarian imperialism is never about humanity , only a pretext for oil . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council resolution to condemn the government 's bloody crackdown on them . \nIn a symbolic display of support , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe met Ghalioun in Paris earlier this week . \n`` Juppe 's gesture was significant , '' Ghalioun said . \n`` The French will consult the other Europeans and we hope to have recognition from European countries later , but let 's wait a few days , weeks , '' he said . \nGhalioun , an intellectual and political sociologist based at the Sorbonne university , was thrust into the limelight this year when peaceful protests against Assad 's government turned violent and demonstrators looked for somebody to help galvanize various strands of the opposition . \nThe 66-year old said the West could be more `` aggressive '' in its approach to Russia , which has refused to join international condemnation of Syria 's long crackdown on protesters and used its veto along with China to reject a draft U.N. resolution . \nHe also called for a conference bringing together the main stakeholders in the Syrian conflict . \n`` I think the European Union and Western countries have not done everything politically to convince Russia and other reticent countries , '' Ghalioun said . \n`` I do n't think there are strong enough positions and actions . '' \nSome figures inside Syria privately criticize the opposition in exile for being too ready to seek outside intervention . \nOther issues dividing the opposition include ethnic and sectarian differences , disagreement over the place of religion in the state and a generational gap between veteran opposition figures and youth activists . \nMichel Kilo , a member of the Syria-based National Committee for Democratic Change -LRB- NCDC -RRB- who has criticized the SNC for not including those in Syria , said on Tuesday he was ready to talk more to the council to avoid divisions that could play into the hands of Assad 's government . \n`` Today , there is the council and there are other opposition members and we will do everything to make sure there is just one voice , '' Ghalioun said . \n`` I do n't think the opposition is divided . \nI think the opposition is unanimous on one objective : the end of the regime and fall of Bashar al-Assad .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon this week that military and police operations had stopped . \nBut activists say his forces are still shooting at protesters . \nThe violent repression prompted coordinated calls from the United States and European Union on Thursday for Assad to step down and Washington imposed sweeping new sanctions on Syria , which borders Israel , Lebanon and Iraq and is an ally of Iran . \nOn Friday , European Union states agreed to expand the number of Syrian officials and institutions targeted by EU sanctions and laid out plans for a possible oil embargo . \nSyria exports over a third of its 385,000 barrels per day output to Europe . \nActivists said five people were killed and 15 wounded in the ancient desert city of Palmyra , when Assad 's forces opened fire during a demonstration . \n`` The people want the execution of the president , '' shouted a crowd in the northern Idlib province . \nSome carried banners with slogans proclaiming `` Signs of Victory '' . \nLocal activist Abdallah Aba Zaid said 18 people were killed in Deraa province , including eight in the town of Ghabaghab , five in Hirak , four in Inkhil and one in Nawa . \nDozens of people were wounded , he said . \nState television blamed the deaths in Ghabaghab on gunmen who attacked a police post , killing a policeman and a civilian and wounding two . \nIt said two members of the security forces and one gunman were killed in a clash in Harasta , near Damascus . \nSyria has expelled most independent media since the unrest began , making it difficult to verify events on the ground . \nThe United Nations says 2,000 civilians have been killed . \nAuthorities blame `` armed terrorist groups '' and Islamists for the bloodshed and say 500 soldiers and police have been killed . \nInternet footage of Friday 's protests suggested that , although widespread , they were smaller than at their peak in July , before Assad sent tanks and troops into several cities . \nBut activists say protests have spread to more cities and become more frequent despite assaults that have intensified since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan . \nA doctor in Zabadani , 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- northeast of Damascus , said army vehicles were in the town and snipers were on rooftops to prevent crowds marching . \nProtesters from the Sunni majority resent the power and wealth amassed by some Alawites , who adhere to an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , and the near monopoly of the sect on the security apparatus . \nThey want Assad to quit , the dismantling of the police state and a transition to democracy . \nPresident Barack Obama froze Syrian state assets in the United States , banned U.S. citizens from operating or investing in Syria and prohibited U.S. imports of Syrian oil products . \nAdding to international pressure , U.N. investigators said Assad 's forces had committed violations that may amount to crimes against humanity . \nThe United Nations plans to send a team to Syria on Saturday to assess the humanitarian situation . \nThe United States , Britain and European allies say they will draft a U.N.

'' \nA government official said Ibrahim 's brother , Hasan Ali , had been killed by NATO Apache helicopter gunships . \nHe said the 25-year-old student had gone with a group to check on friends in Zawiyah -- now under rebel control -- after hearing reports of fighting there . \nHe died in the central square . \n`` We are surprised by this and we condemn it . \nNATO planes have become a way of killing civilians and providing air cover for rebels to advance on Libyan cities , '' the official said . \nWest of Tripoli Thursday , some 200 rebel fighters firing guns in the air celebrated the capture of Sabratha 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- after a four-day battle . \nFighters said the rebels control 90 percent of the ancient Roman town , a UNESCO World Heritage site . \nSecuring Sabratha would tighten their control over supply lines from Tunisia , which were cut at Zawiyah this week . \nA local man said the breakthrough came after NATO bombed a military facility in Sabratha and rebels seized weapons . \nRebel advances in recent days have cut off Gaddafi 's forces from their main resupply routes , ending a long stalemate and putting Gaddafi 's 41-year rule under unprecedented pressure . \nBut insurgents in the east , where casualties have been high , suffered a setback when a group planning to mount an uprising in government-held Zlitan were preempted by Gaddafi forces . \n`` There are still bodies in the streets . \nThe situation is very difficult . \nIt was a preemptive attack by Gaddafi 's forces , '' an anti-government activist called Mohammed told Reuters by telephone from the town , west of the rebel-held port of Misrata . \nFour people were killed and five badly wounded when Gaddafi 's troops attacked rebels who aimed to stage a `` mini '' revolt to coincide with a push from Misrata , he said . \nDespite denials , the rebels and Gaddafi loyalists are in negotiations , former French premier Dominique de Villepin said . \nHe told the daily Le Parisien he held `` extremely difficult '' talks with both Monday , in the Tunisian resort of Djerba . \n`` I was indeed there , but I can not make any further comment because it would compromise the chances of success , '' he added . \nThe whereabouts of Gaddafi , 69 , are unknown . \nAfter a two-day battle , rebel fighters occupied Zawiyah refinery , 50 km west of Tripoli , and raised their flag . \n`` We took control last night , '' said Saleh Omran , 31 , a fighter from Zawiyah . \nHe said the insurgents fought about 150 Gaddafi troops , who finally fled by sea in inflatable boats . \nDoctors at a hospital near Zawiyah said nine people were killed and at least 45 injured in fighting around the town and at the refinery Wednesday , most of them rebels . \nIn Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- said health care facilities in Libya were being attacked or misused for military purposes by both sides in the conflict . \nThe ICRC expressed concern at a rapid deterioration in the humanitarian situation -- as well as mounting casualties -- in and around Brega , Zawiyah , Garyan , Sabratha and Misrata . \n`` On Tuesday , in Brega , our delegates saw several ambulances hit by bullets , '' said Georges Comninos who heads the ICRC team in Tripoli . \n`` This is seriously compromising the delivery of health care to the wounded and sick . '' \nRebels also held Garyan , a strategic crossroads town 80 km inland from Tripoli on a main highway south . \n`` We took one tank and an anti-aircraft gun from Gaddafi 's forces . \nNext , we 'll go to Tripoli , '' one fighter told Reuters in Garyan , where the captured weapons sat in the town square . \nOn the eastern front , the insurgents said they had tightened their grip around the oil port of Brega , but had suffered high casualties in fighting over the past several days . \n`` All of Alargop is now free , liberated , '' spokesman Musa Mahmoud al-Mugrabi said of an area 6 km south of Brega , on a supply route for Gaddafi 's forces running south . \nAbout 40 rebels have been killed and nearly 100 wounded in and around Brega over the past 10 days , according to a tally of reports from the rebels and hospital workers . \n`` Casualties have been very high because it 's urban clashes , '' al-Mugrabi said . \nGaddafi seemed isolated as forces determined to topple him close in , vowing to enter Tripoli by the end of the month . \nLibyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi declined to comment on any talks other than to say the government has been in contact with all sides . \n`` You will hear in the next few days good news that will make you happy if you are for peace , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "172", "time": "2011-08-19", "text": "WASHINGTON | Fri Aug 19 , 2011 7:22 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Now that he has called for Syria 's leader to leave , President Barack Obama faces the daunting challenge of smoothing the way to a post-Assad era -- just as another Arab strongman looks increasingly beleaguered in Libya . \nThe twin crises appear to offer opportunities for U.S. foreign policy -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an ally of Iran , foe of Israel and sponsor of the armed militant group Hezbollah , while Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has vexed U.S. officials for decades . \nBut they also bring grave risks at a time when Obama is focused on domestic affairs . \nBetween them , Assad and his late father have ruled Syria with iron fists for 41 years . \nU.S. and European officials privately concede that civil and political chaos in Syria might be the most likely result if Assad abruptly leaves power . \nSyria 's political opposition is even more disorganized and fragmented than Libyan rebels who now appear to be closing in on Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . \nAfter weeks of resisting , Obama , backed by the European Union , called on Thursday for Assad to go during the same week that Gaddafi 's position in Libya appeared to erode , as rebels seized the key western city of Zawiyeh . \nWith a war-weary U.S. public and tight budgets , the White House has made clear it has no plans to put troops on the ground in Libya or Syria , either to topple their leaders or engage in `` nation-building '' should they depart . \n`` The same concerns that apparently constrained the administration from calling for Assad 's ouster persist today : how do we force Assad out ? \nDoes the fall of the Alawite regime result in sectarian chaos ? \nAnd what comes after this regime amid potential Islamist extremism ? '' \nsaid Juan Zarate , a White House counterterrorism adviser to former President George W. Bush . \nAssad and much of his ruling circle are members of the minority Alawite sect , which makes up about 12 percent of Syria 's population . \n`` The calculus to call for Assad 's ouster has come too late , and it 's now time to find ways with our partners to shape the coming days in Damascus , '' Zarate said . \nThe Syrian opposition , which ranges from secular reformers to Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood , has made halting steps at unity . \nOn Friday , more than 40 `` revolution blocs '' announced they had forged a coalition to unite their efforts to overthrow Assad , according to news reports . \n`` The opposition , on its own and without international involvement , has made significant strides over the past several months to unify , '' a senior U.S. official said this week . \n`` We ca n't predict how long this transition will take . \nNothing about it will be easy . \nBut we 're certain that Assad is on the way out , '' said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity . \nFormer CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin predicted the struggle in Syria would go on for some time `` because of Bashar 's limited incentive to cry ` uncle , ' '' but would result ultimately in Assad 's demise . \nThat might be followed by a weak , Sunni-dominated government and McLaughlin said such an outcome would itself present many challenges . \nHe said it would `` transform Syria into a political battleground between competing regional players , mainly Shiite Iran -- which will be losing its closest ally and the avenue through which it supplies its Hezbollah proxy in Lebanon -- and Saudi Arabia , which will see an opportunity to checkmate Iran 's regional influence by aiding Syria 's Sunni majority . \n`` Just the usual simple Middle East equation -- actually what is already three-dimensional chess will become more like a mosh pit . '' \nIt is unclear how much planning the Obama administration has done for a post-Assad Syria . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton met publicly for the first time this month with Syrian activists . \nBut in Libya , a rapid succession of rebel victories has accelerated Western postwar planning , even as officials discounted intelligence reports suggesting Gaddafi 's departure was imminent . \nThe NATO alliance on Friday authorized formal planning for post-Gaddafi Libya . \nNext week , rebels of the Transitional National Council will meet in Dubai with officials from the United States , Britain , Jordan , United Arab Emirates and perhaps others , `` all devoted to the day-after planning , '' an Obama administration official told Reuters . \nThe working idea is that the UAE , Jordan and Qatar would put together `` a bridging force '' of 1,000 to 2,000 personnel to be deployed in Libya just after Gaddafi goes , the official said . \nWhite House officials are concerned that unless transition plans are firmed up now , post-Gaddafi Libya may be chaotic and it may be impossible to fulfill the West 's promise to protect Libya 's population from a humanitarian crisis . \nSome U.S. and European officials say that despite its better organization and purported recent advances , Libya 's opposition movement is not ready to govern . \nThe optimistic scenario U.S. and European officials hope will develop in Libya is that Gaddafi will decide to go fairly soon but enough of his government and forces will remain intact to enable the formation of a transitional government that can maintain a measure of civil order . \n"}

{"id": "319", "time": "2011-08-17", "text": "BERLIN | Wed Aug 17 , 2011 11:54 pm BST BERLIN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Plans from France and Germany to move towards fiscal union in 2012 got a chilly response from other euro-zone countries and failed to reassure investors worried about the region 's debt crisis and weakened economies . \nAustria , Finland and Ireland all questioned bold proposals from French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to give up sovereignty over budgetary policies as a means to shore up their 17-nation currency union . \nMarket analysts warned that political dissent coupled with failure to deliver any concrete pledges to increase the size of Europe 's euro rescue fund , or launch of euro bonds , risks a renewed attack on heavily indebted countries . \n`` There is little in the way of concrete measures in these decisions , '' said Wolfgang Leoni , chief investment officer at Sal . \n`` This is exactly what the markets do n't want . '' \nIn a sign of investor jitters , flight from the euro currency resumed on Wednesday as money sought the relative safety of the Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar . \nGerman debt , another safe haven , was also well bid compared with other euro-zone government debt . \nThe region 's stock markets were mixed . \nThe message left by Merkel and Sarkozy was that , in the short term , responsibility for warding off any new attacks on indebted euro-zone countries rests solely with the European Central Bank . \nBut the central bank , which already has thrown tens of billions of euros into the bonds of countries such as Italy and Spain is internally divided over the wisdom of that move , creating further anxiety for investors . \n`` I think the crisis in fact is likely to get worse before it gets better despite the announcements that we had yesterday , '' Jacques Cailloux , chief European economist at RBS , told Reuters Insider television . \n`` The ECB is trapped here , '' Cailloux said , adding that he sees the ECB could end up buying almost $ 300 billion worth of Spanish and Italian bonds by late September to fight off waves of speculative attacks . \nThe prospect of the ECB essentially bankrolling countries with budget deficit problems throws the central bank into the heart of European politics , territory way beyond its monetary mandate causing tensions within its governing council . \nECB bond buying acts as a bridge until euro-zone parliaments have approved enhancements agreed last month to Europe 's rescue fund , which would allow it to start making bond purchases . \nThat process passed an important hurdle late on Wednesday when the Dutch prime minister secured broad political support for the Greek bailout agreed last month by European leaders , a key test before an official vote due within a few weeks ' time . \nThe Netherlands is a solid backer of the euro project but its coalition government could face problems with a disillusioned electorate . \nAnother traditional German ally Austria on Wednesday criticised the Franco-German move towards `` economic governance . '' \nIreland reacted sceptically to a pledge by Berlin and Paris to press ahead with a harmonisation of their corporate tax rates in hopes that other euro members would follow suit . \nA separate proposal to write German-style `` debt brake '' rules into national constitutions across the 17-nation currency bloc by mid-2012 faces big hurdles given Sarkozy himself is struggling to secure a parliamentary majority at home for such a plan . \nFinland 's finance minister questioned whether the rule would work at all and said she was `` not too excited '' about making changes to her country 's constitution . \nSome of the steps unveiled at the news conference in Paris on Tuesday would have seemed almost revolutionary as recently as a year ago . \nMerkel bowed to longstanding French calls to hold regular meetings of euro zone leaders and appoint a symbolic president , or spokesman , for the bloc -- steps that are bound to widen the divide between euro `` ins '' and `` outs '' in the 27-nation EU . \nBut in the midst of a crippling crisis that has threatened to engulf big countries like Spain , Italy and France , the announcements were criticised by many as `` too little too late . '' \nSpanish and Italian 10-year bond yields hovered near 5 percent , more than a percentage point below where they stood before the ECB first intervened in the markets earlier this month . \nEconomists said markets could test the resolve of European policymakers again within weeks . \n`` Markets are looking for a magic bullet and that does n't exist , '' said Julian Callow , an economist at Barclays in London . \n`` Instead of a magic bullet we have more of the same . \nGovernments are trying to cut their deficits , that is eating into demand and driving economies weaker . \nBoth Spain and Italy held out hope that Merkel and Sarkozy would change their minds and embrace joint euro bonds . \nOne worry is that the Franco-German proposals re-open a number of contentious debates within the EU , further sapping investor confidence . \nMerkel and Sarkozy vowed on Tuesday to press ahead with long-stalled plans for a financial transactions tax . \nBut the UK has long opposed this , and moving ahead without the City of London could end up hurting the financial sectors in Frankfurt and Paris . \nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he would insist that any such tax apply to all 27 members of the EU , not just the 17 that share the euro . \nLooming elections in key euro zone member states -- Spain votes in November and France in the spring -- could also complicate implementation of the proposals announced by Merkel and Sarkozy . \nFrance 's Socialists have strongly opposed the government 's plans to introduce a balanced budget rule to the constitution , threatening to turn it into a campaign issue . \nOn Wednesday Francois Hollande , the leading Socialist candidate to challenge Sarkozy in next year 's vote , urged a national debate on the issue . \n-LRB- Reporting from European bureaus ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford and Andrew Hay -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt is the most erudite proposal I have read . \nThe simple cure is to realize it is an unmitigated , complete and total disaster -- and then treat it like a lame horse ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nEU leaders called in a statement for the preparation of new sanctions `` to be implemented at the appropriate moment in the case that Iran continues not to cooperate seriously nor to meet its obligations . '' \nThey also warned Syria the European Union `` will impose further and more comprehensive measures against the regime as long as the repression of the civilian population continues . '' \nWashington and the European Union have already pushed four rounds of sanctions through the United Nations over Iran 's nuclear program as well as unilateral measures that have deterred Western investment in Iran 's oil sector and made it harder to move money in and out of the country . \nOn Saturday , Iran dismissed a threat by Washington to impose sanctions on its central bank in response to an alleged assassination plot , saying the United Nations would block the plan and other central banks would not accept it . \nImposing sanctions on the central bank would make it more difficult for Iran to receive payment for exports -- particularly oil , a vital source of hard currency for the world 's fifth biggest crude exporter . \nHowever , any new U.N. action would require need the assent of permanent Security Council members Russia and China , which backed previous rounds of sanctions but may be hard to persuade to go further on the basis of the allegations made so far . \nThe European warning to Iran came after EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton responded last week to an Iranian offer to resume talks by saying there must be no repeat of the last round in January , which ended with no progress . \nAshton has been leading efforts on behalf of the United States , Britain , France , Germany , as well as China and Russia , to negotiate with Tehran over its nuclear activities , which the West believes is aimed at building atomic bombs . \nIran has said it is willing to resume discussions , but insists that other countries recognize its right to enrich uranium , which the West sees as an unacceptable precondition . \nAshton said the six would be willing to resume talks in weeks if Iran was ready to discuss concrete confidence-building measures without pre-conditions . \nIran says its nuclear program is for peaceful production of energy . \nThe European Union already tightened sanctions against Syria this month , adding the Commercial Bank of Syria to a list of entities sanctioned in protest against repression of dissent . \nThe United Nations says 3,000 people have died in the unrest in Syria , including at least 187 children . \nThe U.N. human rights chief has demanded that the world act to stop the carnage and warned of full-blown civil war in the country . \nThe EU imposed an embargo on crude oil imports from Syria in September and banned EU firms from new investment in its oil industry . \nIt also imposed sanctions on the main mobile phone firm , Syriatel , and the largest private company , Cham Holding . \nHowever , the effect of the EU sanctions has been blunted by the blocking by Russia and China of a U.N. resolution that could have led to broader imposition of such steps . \nThe EU leaders urged `` all members of the U.N.

'' \nBloody street fighting rocked Hasaba , home to Sadeq al-Ahmar , a tribal foe of Saleh , in May after the president reneged again on a Gulf-brokered plan to end his 33 years in power . \nThe mortar and machinegun clashes subsided after a bomb blast wounded Saleh in his presidential compound , forcing him to seek treatment in Saudi Arabia , where he is recuperating . \nNow , with troops again manning checkpoints around the capital , the crackle of shooting in the crumbling alleyways of Hasaba -- and outbreaks of fighting elsewhere in a country awash with guns -- have reignited fears of civil war . \nFor seven months , tens of thousands of Yemenis , including those in a protest camp not far from Hasaba , have demonstrated against Saleh . \nBut shootouts between government forces and anti-Saleh gunmen are increasingly marring the peaceful protests . \nYemen , the Arab world 's poorest state and host to an ambitious al Qaeda branch , borders oil giant Saudi Arabia . \nGulf and Western powers fear it could collapse into a failed state on the doorstep of some of the world 's largest oil reserves . \nFighting is on the rise in at least five parts of this rugged , mountainous country on the southern rim of the Arabian Peninsula . \nMore and more armed men roam the streets of Yemeni cities as suspicions and frustrations multiply . \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia , wary of turmoil that could give al Qaeda more room to operate , have been pressing Saleh for months to accept a transition plan brokered by Yemen 's wealthier neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council . \nSaleh has vowed to return to Yemen , even as U.S. officials urge him to stay away , deepening a political stalemate . \nMany Yemenis worry that it is too late to stave off a descent into bloodshed that would only compound their misery . \n`` I think the political solution has been eroded in favor of fighting . \nBut even the fighting will not end the battle , '' said Yemeni analyst Ali Seif Hassan , citing the standoff in Sanaa between government forces and military units commanded Ali Mohsen , a powerful general who has defected to the opposition . \n`` When Yemen 's capital becomes divided like this , it means Yemen will be broken into more than one entity , '' he said . \nA similar confrontation between pro-Saleh forces and opposition tribesmen has turned Taiz , 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of Sanaa , into another tense and divided city . \nFighting has already forced tens of thousands of Yemenis to flee their homes . \nSome are from villages shelled during battles between the army and opposition tribesmen . \nThousands more have escaped from southern towns engulfed in clashes between troops and suspected al Qaeda militants and other Islamist fighters . \nHasaba residents are bracing for the worst . \nMany have piled sandbags outside their already shell-pocked homes . \nAt the nearby protest camp , some still believe in peaceful change but fear that violence could eclipse their struggle . \n`` We still hope to achieve our demands peacefully , but if we ca n't , it raises the threat of war , '' said leftist activist Samia al-Aghbari , sitting outside the rows of protest tents , her frowning face framed by a bright pink veil . \nDesperation is gripping many Yemenis as fuel shortages and soaring prices overwhelm a country where a third of the people suffer chronic hunger and nearly half live on $ 2 a day or less . \nSome residents , frustrated by their own politicians , are also turning their anger on foreign powers they feel have not put enough pressure on the government to reach a solution . \n`` If Saudi Arabia or America wanted Saleh to go they would have done it , '' complained Sanaa shopkeeper Yahya Musallah . \n`` The situation could be finished in less than a month . \nBut they keep waiting and the war will come before they intervene .

{"id": "12", "time": "2011-07-23", "text": "LONDON | Sat Jul 23 , 2011 6:37 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Less than two months after attempting to become the most powerful man in world soccer , Mohamed Bin Hammam was banned from the sport for life on Saturday , completing a spectacular fall from grace . \nThe 62-year-old Qatari , found guilty by FIFA 's ethics committee of attempting to bribe delegates in the Caribbean to vote for him in the FIFA presidential election , has been left with his reputation in tatters and a 29-year career as an administrator over . \nPending any appeals he may pursue , Bin Hammam has lost his place on FIFA 's executive committee after 15 years , been stripped of the Asian Football Confederation -LRB- AFC -RRB- presidency and kissed goodbye to the lifetime privileges normally bestowed on FIFA 's elite after they have left office . \nHis ban means he can not be involved with any club even at grassroots level , although no-one could stop him buying a ticket at the gate and watching a match as a spectator . \nBin Hammam , though , is not just one of the crowd . \nA multi-millionaire businessman who prospered in construction , real estate and drilling as Qatar 's economy boomed in the 1980s and 1990s , he rose from the ranks of his local Al Rayyan Sports Club in Doha to the FIFA executive in 14 years . \nHis position as the most powerful man in Asian soccer was reinforced in Doha as recently as January when he was re-elected unopposed as AFC president and , after mulling over the idea for several months , he launched his bid to depose Sepp Blatter as FIFA president and become the first Arab to rule world soccer . \nIt seemed like the time was right . \nNot only did he have a fresh mandate to complete a third and final term as AFC president , but FIFA 's decision to award Qatar the right to host the 2022 World Cup finals gave him an air of confidence . \nHaving supported Blatter closely , with logistical and strategic help when the Swiss fought Lennart Johansson for the FIFA presidency in 1998 and Issa Hayatou in 2002 , Bin Hammam knew full well the size of the task he was taking on . \nHowever , he decided that , old friendship and support aside , the time had come to reform FIFA and he was the man to do it . \nIn some ways , for such an astute , personable and shrewd man , his plans were somewhat vague . \nBin Hammam outlined proposals to expand the FIFA executive committee from 24 to possibly 40 members , declaring that he wanted the world governing body to `` be more transparent . '' \nHe demanded more respect for clubs and member associations , promised more honesty and wanted a greater share of FIFA 's cash reserves to be distributed to the football associations . \nHe maintained that after 13 years Blatter had been in power too long and said he would restrict the presidential term to eight years . \nHowever , as one Asian critic told Reuters at the time : `` Bin Hammam is no reformer and does not have a real program on how to change FIFA and the way the organization operates . \n`` There are many who think president Blatter is doing a good job -- that perceptions of FIFA can change through Blatter . \nI am not sure the world is ready for Bin Hammam to lead football into a new promised land . '' \nAnyone going into battle has supporters and opponents and clearly by mid-May , with the election just over three weeks away , Bin Hammam thought too many were still against him and he needed to make sure of more votes by paying for them with cash . \nTogether with FIFA executive committee member Jack Warner , the president of CONCACAF and a FIFA vice-president , it was arranged that Bin Hammam would address members of the Caribbean Football Union urging them to support his attempt to unseat Blatter . \nHe hoped that a $ 40,000 -LRB- 24,530.85 pounds -RRB- sweetener , placed in brown envelopes for them to collect on the way out , would help them make up their minds . \nAll it did , though , was herald the suspension , then resignation of Warner after nearly 30 years on the executive committee , and provide the catalyst for Bin Hamman 's downfall . \nDespite his protestations of innocence , the ethics committee found Bin Hammam guilty of trying to bribe those delegates and that decision has cost him his future in the game . \nBin Hammam was a familiar figure at FIFA 's showcase events , either resplendent in his Arab thobe or looking suave in his business suit . \nWith his personal wealth and connections , he might well turn up at matches in the future , but as soccer turns its back on him , he can only look ahead to 2022 and the World Cup in his homeland and wonder what might have been . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for an `` independent , thorough and objective investigation '' of events in Syria . \n`` The scale and gravity of the violations indicate a serious possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed and continue to be committed in Syria , '' Francis Deng , adviser on prevention of genocide , and Edward Luck , adviser on the responsibility to protect , said on Friday . \nOnce courted by the West to break Syria 's alliance with Iran and militant groups , Assad is becoming increasingly isolated internationally . \nIran 's Shi'ite clerical rulers are maintaining their support , to the disquiet of Syria 's majority Sunnis . \nRights groups say the killings of civilians are causing a backlash against Assad among the mostly Sunni rank and file in the army . \nActivists say several tank crews defected this week and joined protesters in the eastern town of Albu Kamal bordering Iraq 's tribal Sunni heartland , prompting the deployment of Alawite forces who surrounded the town and demanded the army defectors be handed over . \nDiplomatic pressure on Assad mounted this week after Qatar , previously a supporter , shut its embassy in Damascus and the European Union said it was considering tougher sanctions . \nRelations with Qatar deteriorated when Sunni Muslims were among those killed by Assad 's security forces , whose leaders , like the president , are Alawites . \nAssistant U.S. Secretary of State Jeff Feltman told U.S. based Al Hurra TV that fear of a sectarian crisis was being instigated by Assad to sow fear among the population . \n`` They are trying to raise the specter of the ghost of a civil war but it 's clear from the majority of demonstrations that everyone is protesting without concern about the dangers confronting them for the sake of a better future for Syria , '' Feltman said . \n"}

'' \nThe United States , grappling with the diplomatic fallout of uprisings and uncertainty across the Arab world , voiced rare public alarm about the situation in Yemen . \n`` We are obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said . \nHis chief concern was to avoid `` diversion of attention '' from opposing al Qaeda there . \nOpposition spokesman Mohammed al-Sabry , rejecting Saleh 's offer to go by January 2012 , said the coming hours would be decisive . \nIn speeches to army officers and tribal leaders in Sanaa , Saleh said Yemen faced a danger of civil war and disintegration because of efforts to stage a `` coup '' against his rule . \n`` You have an agenda to tear down the country , the country will be divided into three instead of two ... -LRB- parts -RRB- . \nA southern part , northern part and a middle part . \nThis is what is being sought by defectors against ... unity , '' he said , referring to northern Shi'ite rebels and al Qaeda militants . \n`` Those who want to climb up to power through coups should know that this is out of the question . \nThe homeland will not be stable , there will be a civil war , a bloody war . \nThey should carefully consider this , '' Saleh told army commanders . \nPresidential guards loyal to Saleh surrounded an air force battalion in the coastal city of Hudaida after its commander said he supported the protesters . \nA presidential guard and a soldier died in clashes between the two forces in the southern coastal city of Mukalla late on Monday , medical sources said . \nIn southern Abyan province , troops clashed with al Qaeda militants , killing 12 and wounding five , state media said . \nLiquefied natural gas producer Yemen LNG has told customers that unrest could lead to supply disruptions , leading stakeholder Total said . \nWestern countries fear the political crisis could hasten a slide into failed nation status for a country that borders the world 's biggest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia , and major shipping routes . \nOne scenario could see the country split into separate zones along tribal , military or regional lines . \nAl Qaeda has already used Yemen to attempt attacks in Saudi Arabia and the United States in the past two years . \nThe Shi'ite Houthi movement has staged a number of revolts against Saleh . \nOne opposition leader offered Saleh the prospect of secure retirement if , like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , he would go quietly , unlike Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . \n`` He should n't follow the style of Gaddafi by destroying the country and killing people , '' Yassin Noman , rotating head of Yemen 's opposition coalition said . \n`` After this long term of governing , he should say : Thank you my people , I leave you peacefully . '' \n`` I know the morality of Yemeni people . \nIf he left peacefully , they will look at him as a real leader . \nHe will be able to live wherever he likes , '' Noman told Reuters . \n`` They will ensure him a very nice life . \nHis dignity will be kept . '' \nSeveral generals and officials have abandoned Saleh this week after a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators on Friday On Tuesday , Abdel-Malik Mansour , Yemen 's envoy to the Arab League , told Al Arabiya television he was siding with protesters . \nAbdul-Rahman al-Iryani , whom Saleh sacked as environment minister on Sunday along with the rest of the cabinet , said on Facebook he was joining `` the revolutionaries . '' \nDefections have included generals , tribal leaders , diplomats and ministers . \nThey have gained momentum since gunmen loyal to Saleh opened fire on demonstrators in the capital Sanaa on Friday . \nFifty-two people were killed . \nA crowd of around 10,000 gathered outside Sanaa University in a rally that has been repeated for the past seven weeks , with youth playing a key role . \nSaleh offered dialogue with young people on Tuesday , and state media said he was sympathetic to their problems . \nProtesters , however , have been uncompromising . \nEchoing demands that have been satisfied in Tunisia and Egypt and continue to be heard elsewhere across the region , they chanted : `` The people want the fall of regime . '' \nThe body of one of those killed on Friday was brought to the protesters before burial . \n`` The people want a trial for the butcher , '' they shouted , hurling abuse at Saleh . \nFrance on Monday became the first Western power to call publicly for Saleh to stand down . \nForeign Minister Alain Juppe described his departure as `` unavoidable . '' \nYemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi returned from Riyadh on Monday where Saleh sent him to seek Saudi-led Gulf Arab mediation . \nA diplomatic source said there had been no indication of success in the effort to involve those countries . \nTribal sources said tribal sheikhs had embarked on mediation efforts on Tuesday , focusing on a potential agreement that protests could continue , violence against protesters would be investigated and a smooth transition of power would take place . \nNo more details were available . \nOn Tuesday , soldiers were preventing cars driving along roads close to Saleh 's presidential palace in Sanaa . \nLate on Monday night residents heard explosions and shooting near a presidential place in Yemen 's eastern port of Mukalla . \nGeneral Ali Mohsen , commander of the northwest military zone and Saleh 's kinsman from the al-Ahmar clan , said on Monday he was backing the protesters and warned of civil war . \nOn Tuesday Mohsen -- seen by northern rebels as a ruthless military leader -- declared in a statement read out to the protesters camping out in Sanaa that the `` era of military coups is over '' and vowed to protect the `` youth revolution . '' \nTanks were deployed outside the presidential palace in the southern port city of Aden , focal point of a separatist movement hoping to escape Yemen 's myriad problems by recreating the former South Yemen that feels cheated by unity under Saleh . \nOpponents complain that Yemen under Saleh has failed to meet the basic needs of the country 's 23 million people . \nUnemployment is around 35 percent and 50 percent for young people . \nOil wealth is dwindling and water is running out . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThere are turmoil in Yemen , Bahrain and Libya . \nWhy in the world would France , the US and etc. western countries only declaired a war to Libya ?!

'' \nThe region , where four protesters have been killed by security forces since Friday , has seen the first non-sectarian protests against the Baath Party since Assad 's late father Hafez al-Assad crushed leftist and Islamist opponents in the 1980s . \nAmong them were the cream of Syrian society -- lawyer and former judge Haitham al-Maleh , leftist leader Riad al-Turk , writer Akram al-Bunni , and poet Mohammad al-Maghout , who wrote that being tortured by a compatriot was more painful and humiliating than repression under French colonialism . \nThe violent campaign by the Syrian authorities in the 1980s left up to 70,000 people missing . \nIn 2004 , Kurds , many of whom are denied Syrian citizenship , mounted violent demonstrations against the government in which 30 people were killed . \nIn a sign of changing times , Montaha al-Atrash , whose father led a revolt against French rule in the 1920s , addressed Assad directly in an interview on BBC Television . \n`` Dr Bashar , listen to us . \nNon-stop pressure and repression will generate an explosion . \nYou know , and you see how the region is boiling , '' said Atrash , referring to a wave of Arab uprisings which have toppled two leaders and challenged many more . \n`` The regime is still responding to anyone calling for change by trying to portray it as a scheme for sectarian strife and division , and by unleashing on demonstrators security forces who are already filling the streets , '' she added , speaking in Syria . \nThe protesters have not called for the removal of Assad , and Atrash said there was no hatred against the president , an ophthalmologist by training who was thrust into politics when his elder brother Bassel died in car accident in 1994 . \nBut the name of one top figure of the ruling elite , Assad 's cousin Rami Makhlouf , is being uttered publicly . \nOwner of Syria 's largest cellphone company and several large businesses , Makhlouf is under U.S. sanctions for what Washington regards as public corruption . \nUntil now , no one inside Syria has dared question his activities . \nThe tycoon maintains his businesses are legitimate , providing professional employment for thousands of Syrians . \n`` Go away Makhlouf . \nWe do n't want thieves ... There is no more fear after today , '' is one of the main chants of demonstrators who burned premises of Makhlouf 's Syriatel company . \nResidents of Deraa city , where the demonstrations started on Friday , say they have shaken off humiliation and decades of repression , and broken a ` fear factor ' that had made people suspicious that even close relatives might be informants . \n`` I can now smell freedom , '' said one youth , describing how mass demonstrations had helped unify a tribal-based society he said authorities had played a part in fracturing . \nEven if protests subside -- the south was calm on Tuesday morning -- Syrians say the grievances which sparked them remain . \nOpposition figure Riad al-Turk , who spent 25 years as a political prisoner including almost 18 years alone in a 2-meter by 2-meter underground cell during Hafez al-Assad 's rule , said Syrian leaders face `` the moment of truth . '' \n`` What is required is serious and clear steps to transform Syria from repression to democracy . \n`` They are steps outlined repeatedly : release political prisoners , abolish the state of emergency , legalize a multi-party system , separation of powers , the independence of the judiciary , and scrap the clause that makes the Baath Party ` leader of state and society ' , '' he said . \n`` All I know today is that Syria will not remain the kingdom of silence , '' 80-year-old Turk said . \n`` Fear will no longer suffocate , and my homeland will not remain a big prison .

{"id": "218", "time": "2011-08-09", "text": "LONDON | Tue Aug 9 , 2011 1:45 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Gold is set to widen its premium over platinum after hitting parity for the first time in 2-1\\/2 years this week , with no end yet in sight to the potent cocktail of fear factors that are benefiting safe havens at the expense of cyclical assets . \nGold prices rose above those of platinum for the first time since December 2008 late on Monday . \nThe last time this happened , the situation reversed within a few days , and traders said then that the convergence of the gold-platinum ratio gave a clear signal to sell gold and buy platinum . \nToday 's backdrop is very different . \n`` Gold as a defensive asset is being driven higher at the moment by risk aversion , and platinum as a cyclical asset is under pressure because growth is slowing , '' said Michael Widmer , an analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch . \n`` We were there around the great recession -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , and then you had the various stimulus packages hitting the market , and you saw the prices of the two metals starting to diverge again , '' he said . \n`` The macro picture is a bit different this time around . \nI do n't think that it is a compelling trade . '' \nIn contrast to the situation in 2008 , gold 's premium to platinum is a function of its own strength , rather than a falling platinum price . \nGold hit a record $ 1,778.29 an ounce this week as concerns over economic stability and debt crises in the euro zone and United States sparked heavy buying among investors . \nPlatinum prices have eased by just over 2 percent this year , although they have not dropped in the same way as some industrial metals such as copper , which is down 8.2 percent in electronic trading , or zinc down 13.2 percent . \nAlthough platinum is nominally a precious metal , the bulk of its demand comes from the industrial sector , particularly carmakers who use it to make catalytic converters . \nThis makes it more sensitive to threats to growth . \nThis may mean it still has some way to fall , potentially further widening its discount to gold , analysts said . \nIn 2008 , platinum plummeted from record highs to fall below the price of gold , said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Lewis . \n`` Now ... this parity has occurred and we have n't priced in that recession risk yet , '' he said . \n`` There is more risk that if we get negative data , it could sustain that discount of platinum for a longer period of time . '' \nA short-term reversal in the ratio is possible . \nThe current rush for safety sparked by Standard & Poor 's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating on Friday has sparked a 6.3 percent rally in gold prices in the past two days alone , their biggest two-day rise since 2008 . \nThat kind of jump has typically been followed by a correction , as was seen in late April after gold 's initial break above $ 1,500 an ounce . \nAt the same time , there are some factors that could suggest a short-term rise in platinum prices as the threat of strike action among miners in South Africa , the source of four out of five ounces of the world 's platinum supply , continues to loom . \nBut any possible reversal in the fortunes of gold and platinum are likely to be brief , with the wider economic picture still overwhelmingly pointing to continued appetite for so-called havens at the expense of assets seen as higher risk . \n`` If you look at the platinum group metals and other industrial metals as well as oil , it is all a one-way street -- down , '' said Afshin Nabavi , head of trading at MKS Finance . \n`` Gold and the Swiss franc are really the only safe havens . '' \nIn the longer term , gold prices will undoubtedly correct at some point , with a rise in U.S. interest rates expected to be the turning point in the yellow metal 's decade-long rally . \nMeanwhile , platinum 's underlying supply fundamentals still point to higher prices as South Africa 's mining sector faces stronger cost pressures from an increased focus on safety , rising inflation and higher wage demands . \nThis should give long-term support to the metal . \nBut in the current environment , few are looking that far out . \n`` On a historical basis , the ratio looks cheap , but that is not necessarily reason to buy , '' UBS analyst Edel Tully said in a research note . \n`` If we were prepared to buy the ratio now and hold it for a year or two , it would probably be a good trade , given that platinum 's fundamentals signal a lot more tightness over the medium term . \nBut as investors struggle to make money in the short term , positioning for the medium term is in short supply .

'' \nWhile the two men held talks in Damascus , Syrian forces killed at least 30 people and moved into a town near the Turkish border , an activist group said . \nThe National Organization for Human Rights said most of the fatalities occurred when troops backed by tanks and armored vehicles overran villages north of Hama , while four were killed in Binnish , 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- from the border with Turkey . \nWashington expressed disappointment at Assad 's latest comments and said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expected to talk to Davutoglu after his meetings in Syria . \n`` It is deeply regrettable that President Assad does not seem to be hearing the increasingly loud voice of the international community , '' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters when asked about the comment . \nShe refused to comment directly on a 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable quoted by McClatchy newspapers last week describing Assad in unflattering terms , calling him `` neither as shrewd nor as long-winded as his father '' -LRB- former president Hafez al-Assad -RRB- . \nDespite the growing international condemnation , including a sudden wave of Arab criticism , Assad 's forces pursued an offensive in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor , residents said . \nActivists say at least 1,600 civilians have died since the uprising against Assad erupted in March , making it one of the bloodiest of the upheavals sweeping the Arab world . \nDavutoglu held six hours of meetings with Syrian officials , including a two-hour session alone with Assad . \nHe told reporters on his return to Ankara that Turkey had demanded Damascus stop killing civilians and said his government would maintain contacts with all parts of Syrian society . \nDavutoglu said Turkey hoped for a peaceful transition in Syria resulting in the Syrian people deciding their own future . \nNeighboring Turkey has grown increasingly critical of the violence but earned a sharp rebuke on Sunday when an Assad adviser said Syria would not accept interference in its affairs . \nSyria has faced nearly five months of protests against Assad 's 11-year rule , inspired by Arab revolts which overthrew leaders in Egypt and Tunisia earlier this year . \nLast week Assad sent troops and tanks to quell the mostly Sunni Muslim city of Hama in central Syria and the army launched a similar assault on Sunday against Deir al-Zor . \nAn armored column also pushed toward the center of the city on Tuesday , with troops storming houses and making arrests in the provincial capital of an oil region bordering Iraq 's Sunni heartland , a resident said . \n`` They are now about one kilometer from downtown . \nWhen they finish with one district , they move to another , '' said the resident , who gave his name as Iyad . \nIncreasing the pressure on Assad , Sunni Muslim power Saudi Arabia issued a blunt warning that he risked turmoil unless he stopped the bloodshed and adopted reforms . \nKuwait and Bahrain followed the kingdom in recalling their ambassadors . \nThe withdrawal of envoys left Assad with few diplomatic friends bar Iran . \nWestern states have imposed sanctions on his top officials , while states with close ties to Damascus such as Russia and Turkey have warned Assad he is running out of time . \nNevertheless , no country has proposed military action such as that launched against Libya 's leader Muammar Gaddafi . \nIn Deir al-Zor , a resident said on Monday 65 people had been killed since tanks and armored vehicles barreled into the city , 400 km -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- northeast of Damascus on Sunday . \nThe British-based Syrian Observatory of Human Rights said among the dead were a mother and her two children , an elderly woman and a girl . \nSyria has expelled most independent media since the revolt began , making it hard to confirm accounts . \nSyrian authorities have denied that any Deir al-Zor assault took place . \nThey say they have faced attacks since the protests erupted in March , blaming armed saboteurs for civilian deaths and accusing them of killing 500 security personnel . \nState television broadcast footage on Sunday of mutilated bodies floating in the Orontes river in Hama , saying 17 police had been ambushed and killed in the central Syrian city . \nThe official SANA news agency said on Monday the military was starting to pull out of Hama after it said they had helped restore order . \nResidents said there were still tanks in parts of the city and security forces were making arrests . \nAbout 1,500 people were detained in Hama 's Jarajima district and troops killed three civilians , the Observatory said . \nActivists say at least 130 people were killed in Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist uprising in 1982 , and one group has put the death toll at over 300 . \nLike most of Syria , ruled by Assad 's minority Alawite family , Hama and Deir al-Zor are mainly Sunni cities , and the crackdowns there resonate with Sunnis , who form the majority in the region and govern most Arab countries . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAil habeeb opposed the massacres committed by the syrian regime in Hama and other syrian cities . \nI believe in those citizens of Syria who call for reforms of the society so that it may become more democratic and open . \nWhat I believe the government of Syria owes to its people is the protection of the state against those parties that would disrupt civil society . \nThe radical Sunni parties that are opportunist and have tainted the freedom movement in hopes of establishing an Islamic-law government , where non-Muslims are unwelcome . \nThis hearkens back to the bleaker periods of Syria , when `` non-believers '' where discriminated against , driven from their land and often times slaughtered . \nFor so-called `` democratic '' governments , the US and EU seem very willing to allow the Middle East to revert to the dark ages . \nThere democratic principles appear to be non-existent when it comes to freedom for the people of the Middle East . \nThey seem very willing to allow these people to be placed under the iron hand of Salafists . \nIt appears to me that the West are the mercenaries of the extremist Wahhabis and will do their bidding in exchange for reasonable oil prices\\/production and trade . \nPrinciples are subverted by economic interests . \nWhat legitimate reason was there for the West to interfere in Libya ? \nI find it very ironic , hypocritical and laughable that King Abdullah is condemning the Syrians for the violence on their own people when if it was not for the financial subsidies it grants to its citizens , it would find itself in the same boat . \nThe US and EU were comparatively silent when uprisings in Bahrain and Yemen so the governments go against their people . \nWe saw Saudi Arabia send troops into Bahrain to help it put down a similar demonstration for freedom . \nThere were nothing more than a few innocuous passing comments from the West . \nThe whole situation appears to have become rather sectarian to me and the West is siding with those radical elements who are most dedicated to its demise -LRB- but should the West expect any less given its meddling and biased policies in the region . \nI am under no illusions regarding the brutality of the Syrian army in repressing these extremists . \nNeither am I naive , nor should the world be , that all the anti-government Syrians are peaceful protesters . \nThe Saudis -LRB- the ultimate Salafists -RRB- are most likely funding a large part of the violent anti-government protesters . \nThey are funding the arms being sent to those radical elements in Syria through Jordan , Iraq and Turkey . \nThe West should be called upon to be proponents of ethical treatment of all people not just those who are buttering their bread . \nThe ONLY solution for syria is widespread Turkish military offense against the brutal regimen of Bashar alasad . \nThis will prevent horrible upcoming civil war in Syria and chaos that may spread to surrounding countires . \nSyria was part of Turkey for more than 400 years before it had its independence , which obviously was a big mistake . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their

{"id": "94", "time": "2011-10-02", "text": "AMMAN | Sun Oct 2 , 2011 7:42 pm EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's main opposition groups joined together Sunday to call on the international community to take action to protect Syrian people facing a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests . \nA statement issued in Istanbul on behalf of the newly formed National Council rejected foreign intervention that `` compromises Syria 's sovereignty '' but said the outside world had a humanitarian obligation to protect the Syrian people . \n`` The Council demands international governments and organizations meet their responsibility to support the Syrian people , protect them and stop the crimes and gross human rights violations being committed by the illegitimate current regime , '' the statement said . \nThe declaration and support for the National Council was a significant show of unity from the Syrian opposition after six months of mostly non-violent protests against President Bashar al-Assad have begun to be overtaken by more violent resistance . \nArmed insurgents , mostly in the central Homs region and in the northwestern province of Idlib near Turkey , have been so far outgunned . \nThe official Syrian news agency said Saturday government forces had regained control of the central town of Rastan , after the most prolonged fighting yet between the army and insurgents who are led , according to residents , by army defectors . \nBut underlining the more violent turn , Syrian authorities said that the son of Syria 's Mufti , who is appointed by Assad , was assassinated Sunday . \nIt was the first attack against the state-backed Sunni clergy who have been a base of support for Assad 's ruling Alawite elite for decades . \nIn Istanbul , the National Council said that the uprising must remain peaceful but that military assaults on numerous towns and villages , torture and mass arrests were driving Syria `` to the edge of civil war and inviting foreign interference . '' \nIt also said the Muslim Brotherhood , the Damascus Declaration - the main grouping of established opposition figures - and grassroots activists all had joined the National Council . \nWhile few expect a Libya-style intervention in Syria , the declaration was nonetheless a way for the opposition to shake off its image of in-fighting and lack of cohesive leadership . \n`` The fact that Islamists , secular figures and activists on the ground are now on one council is a significant , '' a diplomat in the Syrian capital Damascus said . \n`` But they still have to demonstrate that they could be politically savvy and able to fill any political vacuum . \nThey need a detailed action plan beyond the generalities of wanting a democratic Syria .

{"id": "101", "time": "2011-10-05", "text": "\\* Capital spending to rise 2012-2015 , overheads frozen \\* Budget to assume ambitious oil production ABUJA , Oct 5 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Nigeria plans to end costly fuel subsidies in the 2012 fiscal year to release funds for infrastructure projects and to create jobs , while overall spending next year is likely to rise , according to plans sent for lawmakers approval . \nSubsidising the cost of fuel , mainly diesel , petrol and kerosene , costs the government 1.2 trillion naira -LRB- $ 7.5 billion -RRB- in lost revenues but removing the support will be unpopular with many Nigerians who see it as the only benefit they gain from living in an oil-rich country . \nPrevious efforts to remove subsidies have resulted in nationwide strike action in Africa 's most populous nation , where most people live on less than $ 2 a day . \nThere have been several protests this year in anticipation of deregulation . \n`` A major component of the policy of fiscal consolidation is the government 's intent to phase out the fuel subsidy beginning from 2012 fiscal year , '' said a 2012-2015 Medium Term Fiscal Framework -LRB- MTFF -RRB- and Medium Term Expenditure Framework -LRB- MTEF -RRB- paper . \n`` This will free up about 1.2 trillion naira in savings , part of which can be deployed into providing safety nets for poor segments of society to ameliorate the effects of the subsidy removal , '' the federal government document said . \nThe document is with the national assembly . \nHow quickly lawmakers pass the plans will give an indication of how soon and the next budget will be ready for implementation . \nThe 2011 budget process was chaotic after lawmakers inflated spending plans before the president reduced them again , finally passing the budget in May . \nFinance Minister and Coordinator of the Economy , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala , has pledged to avoid the problems of the 2011 budget by getting the spending plans organised earlier . \nThe fiscal strategy paper hints that the government will forward a 4.8 trillion naira budget for 2012 to the national assembly later this month , up from around 4.5 trillion in this year 's budget passed in May . \nNigeria only spends around a quarter of its budget on capital expenditure , meaning most of the billions of dollars it earns in oil revenues are spent keeping its government running . \nHowever , capital expenditure looks set to rise slightly to 1.32 trillion naira in 2012 as a component of the overall budget , while this should improve as overhead allocations are to be frozen until 2015 , the documents showed . \n`` Although aggregate expenditure is expected to increase from 4.8 trillion in 2012 to 5.18 trillion in 2015 , concerted efforts are being made to make savings from overheads as allocations will be frozen till 2015 , '' it said . \nOkonjo-Iweala will need to persuade lawmakers to get the budget passed when it arrives at the national assembly but they have previously fought hard to defend recurrent expenditure levels , some of which make up their large wages and expenses . \nThe former World Bank chief has pledged to keep the fiscal deficit under 3 percent and if the MTFF is adhered to the deficit would be reduced to 2.69 percent next year . \n`` The Increase in capital expenditure is a welcome development , given the excesses of the recent past , in which recurrent spending was increased greatly , to the detriment of Nigeria 's oil savings and wider macroeconomic stability , '' said Razia Khan , Head of Africa Research at Standard Chartered . \n`` Even more positive is the proposal to remove the fuel subsidy put to national assembly . \nThe subsidy was expensive , responsible for significant distortions and rent-seeking opportunities in the Nigerian economy , with little overall benefit . '' \nThe 2012 budget will be based on the assumption of an ambitious average oil production of 2.48 million barrels per day and a benchmark price LCOc1 of $ 75 dollars per barrel . \nNigeria 's current oil output is around 2.5 million bpd and the projections leave little room for maneuver should Nigeria suffer outages , common in the past , while global economic uncertainty by no means guarantees oil prices will stay high . \n-LRB- $ 1 = 159.300 Nigerian Nairas -RRB- -LRB- Additional reporting and writing by Joe Brock ; editing by Ron Askew -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "329", "time": "2011-10-05", "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Oct 5 , 2011 7:49 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey said on Wednesday it would impose sanctions on Syria despite the blocking of any U.N. measures against President Bashar al-Assad for his crackdown on dissent . \nRussia and China handed Assad a diplomatic victory on Tuesday by vetoing a Western-backed U.N. resolution that could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , but Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan promised action of his own . \n`` Naturally the veto ... can not prevent sanctions , '' Erdogan said . \n`` We will of necessity implement a package of sanctions . '' \nErdogan , who is visiting South Africa , has said he will announce the package after he visits a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey in the next few days . \nThe double veto by Moscow and Beijing infuriated Western powers which have already imposed their own sanctions on Syria and were trying to pave the way for a U.N. embargo , and will reinforce Assad 's hold on power -- at least in the short term . \n`` This is a sad day for the Syrian people . \nIt 's a sad day for the Security Council , '' France 's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . \nGermany also expressed disappointment . \nA government spokesman said the draft resolution would have been an important signal of support for many Syrians `` who for months have been taking to the streets for political freedom . '' \nSyria 's state news agency SANA said Damascus welcomed the veto . \n`` It restores hope for a balanced world ... after a long time of American and European domination which turned the Security Council 's resolutions into a tool for punishing defenders of independence and liberation , '' SANA said . \nThe draft resolution received nine votes in favor and four abstentions . \nU.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington was outraged and called for `` tough targeted sanctions '' on Damascus . \nRussia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow rejected the threat of sanctions on Syria and China 's envoy Li Baodong said Beijing opposed `` interference in -LRB- Syria 's -RRB- internal affairs . '' \nRussia has close ties with Assad 's government , which has been a client for arms sales , and has a naval maintenance facility on Syria 's Mediterranean coast . \nBeijing and Moscow , which had voiced concern that the draft could pave the way for Libya-style military intervention , also want to limit Western influence in the Middle East , while the United States and Europe have long sought to loosen Syria 's alliance with Iran . \nAssad has used tanks and troops to crush an uprising which erupted in March , inspired by regional revolts which toppled three North African leaders this year . \nThe United Nations says 2,700 civilians have been killed . \nDamascus blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which it says have killed at least 700 security personnel . \nSyria 's economy is reeling from the impact of the unrest and U.S. and European sanctions on the small but key oil sector . \nAssad faces a more united opposition after groups in exile came together in Istanbul on Sunday to call for his downfall , but the U.N. vote marks a setback to his opponents who had hoped for an escalation in international pressure on Damascus . \n`` We deeply regret the positions of Russia and China toward the resolution , '' said Omar Idlibi of the grassroots Local Coordination Committee in Beirut , adding he had `` not lost hope in the international community . '' \nIdlibi said the opposition was studying options including a general strike or civil disobedience campaign , but analysts said Assad did not look threatened in the immediate future . \n`` The mere fact that Assad can avoid international sanctions for the time being reinforces his position in the short term , '' said Ayham Kamel from the Eurasia thinktank . \n`` Assad is going to remain in power in the near term . \nI do n't think there are signs of imminent collapse but Syria faces challenges across the country -- the economy , insecurity across the country , and a more organized opposition . '' \nSyria banned most imports last month to try and conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves , but rescinded the measure on Tuesday after a spike in prices and disquiet among an influential merchant class that has been backing Assad . \nTurkish sanctions could also have a major impact . \nBut Turkish officials have made clear that any measures will target Assad 's government and not the Syrian people . \nFor this reason Turkey has ruled out cutting off electricity sales or reducing the flow of water in the Euphrates river into Syria . \nBilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was worth $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , and Turkish firms had investments of $ 260 million in Syria One target of sanctions is likely to be Syria 's state banking system , which could effectively block purchases of Syrian crude oil . \nOther possible measures could freeze Turkish cooperation in oil and gas projects involving state-run firms . \nState television broadcast an interview on Wednesday with a young woman who denied reports by rights groups last month that she had been killed and mutilated , possibly in state custody . \nThe mother of Zainab al-Hosni , 18 , from the city of Homs , confirmed that the woman on television was her daughter , who was reported to have killed after disappearing in July , Human Rights Watch said . \n`` We spoke to the family and they were able to confirm that the person who appeared on TV was Zainab , '' said Nadim Houry of HRW in Beirut . \n`` The mother said she was her daughter . '' \nHosni became an icon for the Syrian revolt against Assad after the body of a badly burned , decapitated woman was found in a morgue by Hosni 's family , according to reports by HRW and Amnesty International . \nAfter months of peaceful protests , some army deserters and dissidents have taken up arms , prompting military operations against them , especially in areas bordering Turkey and Jordan . \nColonel Riad al-Asaad , a Syrian officer who defected and fled to Turkey , said last week 10,000 soldiers had deserted , but authorities have denied any army defections , saying the military operations were a response to appeals by residents . \nAssad retains control of the military , whose mostly Sunni Muslim rank and file are largely commanded by officers of his minority Alawite sect . \nSyria has mostly closed its doors to independent media , making it hard to verify events , but a trickle of desertions appears to have gathered pace in the last several weeks . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIn Syria Russia has military installations , so Syrian people that want democracy are killed by Syrian soldiers using Russian , T-64 , T-85 I suppose tanks . \nI SEE NO DIFFERENCE , if anybody is brilliant to perceive it please comment . \nWell in fact fate of Bahraini is far worse than Syrian , but it is a different story ...

'' \nHe said in the past 24 hours rebel forces had , in fact , pushed about 10 km -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- northeast of Bir al-Ghanam , and were now planning to push towards the coastal town of Zawiyah . \nZawiyah , which lies 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , has been the scene of two uprisings which were smashed by Gaddafi 's security forces . \nA large contingent of the rebels fighting around Bir al-Ghanam are from Zawiyah . \nIt was not immediately possible to verify independently who was in control of Bir al-Ghanam . \nMost analysts say Gaddafi will eventually be forced to relinquish power if NATO states and their rebel allies maintain the pressure on him by starving him of weapons , fuel and cash and attacking his forces . \nHowever , some alliance members are unsettled by how long the Libyan campaign is dragging on and how much it is costing , especially at a time of economic uncertainty . \nIf NATO wavers , this could give Gaddafi an opportunity to hold on to power . \nFor now though , there is no sign of a let-up in the air campaign , led by French and British warplanes . \nA Reuters reporter in Tripoli said there were multiple strikes overnight in the southeast of the city . \nAfter the initial explosions , there were smaller blasts on the ground and flames shooting into the air , suggesting the target contained highly flammable material . \nBritain said on Saturday -- while rebels were attacking Bir al-Ghanam -- its aircraft had been in the area and attacked two ammunitions stores , a military headquarters and a position supporting government rocket launchers . \nIn a separate operation on Sunday , British Apache attack helicopters took off from a warship in the Mediterranean Sea and fired Hellfire missiles at military vehicles in Al-Watyah , the site of a government air base 170 km south-west of Tripoli , spokesman Major General Nick Pope said in a statement . \nPotentially adding to pressure on Gaddafi , Tripoli has been experiencing power shortages in the past few days and these have been growing worse . \nLibyan state television appealed on Sunday to people to conserve energy by switching off air conditioners in mosques and offices when they are not in use . \nBecause of the blackouts , many residents have no air conditioning during the peak summer heat and no refrigeration as they prepare for evening meals during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . \nSome areas of the Libyan capital are getting as little as four hours of power a day , residents said this week . \nMohamed Abu Ajeela Rashid , a former Libyan health minister who is now a senior hospital doctor , said power was cut while he was performing surgery . \nHe said he had to complete the operation by the light of his cell phone . \nLibyan government officials have said the problems will be fixed within the next few days . \nThey blame NATO for attacking electricity lines , but an official with the alliance denied there had been any such strikes . \nIn eastern Libya , where rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces are fighting along another front , rebel commanders said they were making a big push to capture the coastal oil town of Brega , about 780 km from Tripoli . \nBut they said progress was slow because Gaddafi 's forces had laid minefields around the town . \n`` We do n't want to lose anybody so we 're moving slowly but surely , '' said rebel spokesman Mohammad Zawawi . \nPope Benedict , giving his Sunday blessing from the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo near Rome , appealed for an end to violence in the Middle East . \n`` My thoughts also go to Libya , where the use of arms has not resolved the situation , '' he said . \n`` I urge the international organizations and those with political and military responsibilities to relaunch the search for a peace plan for the country with conviction and determination , through talks and constructive dialogue .

'' \nFerguson 's United have made a habit of coming from behind to snatch important victories and the catalyst against City was the manager 's decision at halftime to replace the experienced Rio Ferdinand , Nemanja Vidic and Michael Carrick . \nNew signing Phil Jones , Jonny Evans and young midfielder Tom Cleverley were thrown into the fray and their energy and enthusiasm were vital as United tore into the City defense . \n`` The difference the young lads made was outstanding , '' United striker Wayne Rooney said . \n`` We never know when a game is finished . \nOf course they are going to try and fight us for the title . \nThey scored two goals from nowhere but we showed character to win the game . '' \nFerguson has so far failed to sign a replacement for the retired Paul Scholes but the 21-year-old Cleverley 's neat distribution and tactical awareness hinted that he could provide at least a temporary solution . \nOne concern for Ferguson was the performance of his new Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea who was stranded when Joleon Lescott nodded in David Silva 's teasing free kick and slow to react when Edin Dzeko 's ambitious 30-metre strike flew past him just before halftime . \n`` It was bending a bit , it 's difficult to say if he should have done better , '' Ferguson said . \nCity manager Roberto Mancini , charged with the task of ending United 's domination of English soccer and bringing the league title to the club for the first time since 1968 , admitted his side had been outplayed . \n`` They were better than us but sometimes in football if you can not score you give the other team a chance . \nWe were 2-0 up so it is not good to lose from this position .

{"id": "112", "time": "2011-07-14", "text": "KABUL | Thu Jul 14 , 2011 12:08 pm BST KABUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The first half of this year was the deadliest six months for civilians in Afghanistan since the decade-old war began , the country 's U.N. mission said on Thursday . \nCivilian deaths hit a record high , up 15 percent compared to the first half of 2010 , due to roadside and suicide bombings , increased ground fighting and more deaths from air strikes . \nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan -LRB- UNAMA -RRB- said 1,462 civilians had been killed in conflict-related incidents . \nIt blamed insurgents for 80 percent of those deaths -- up nearly a third on the same period last year . \n`` The rising tide of violence and bloodshed in the first half of 2011 brought injury and death to Afghan civilians at levels without recorded precedent in the current armed conflict , '' the report said , adding that plans to hand over security in parts of the country helped fuel the rise in casualties . \n`` Violence rose as -LRB- insurgents -RRB- sought to demonstrate that Afghan security forces could not manage security on their own . '' \nStaffan de Mistura , special representative in Afghanistan for the U.N. Secretary-General , told a news conference the U.N. mission had been in contact with the Taliban to ask them to reduce the number of civilian deaths . \nHe declined to comment on their response to the U.N. 's request . \nPro-government forces , including the Afghan police and army and NATO-led troops were responsible for 14 percent of civilian deaths , a drop of 9 percent . \nBut air strikes , one of the most controversial tactics in the war , killed more people . \nThe mid-year report found that air strikes carried out by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- were the leading cause of civilian deaths by pro-government forces , so far killing 79 civilians in 2011 , up 14 percent . \nApache attack helicopters played a much more prominent role , mainly in the east and southeast of the country , said Georgette Gagnon , director of human rights at the U.N. mission . \nA third of civilian deaths attributed to air strikes in 2010 were caused by those aircraft , while in the first half of 2011 they were responsible for 56 percent of air strike deaths . \nDe Mistura said that while ISAF had been successful in reducing the number of civilian deaths it caused , `` for an international force that is meant to protect civilians , one civilian killed , even by mistake , is one too many . '' \nThe United Nations also warned the full picture could be even worse , as the report did not include data from the northern region of Afghanistan between March and June , because the U.N. office was shut after it was overrun by a mob that killed seven U.N. staff . \n`` It may be that UNAMA is under-reporting civilian casualties given limitations associated with the operating environment , '' the report said . \nISAF and the Taliban were not immediately able to comment on the U.N. report . \nPierre Kraehenbuehl , the global director of operations of the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- , said he was `` gravely concerned '' about critical levels of insecurity that risked displacing many more Afghans . \n`` Many people have told us that they face now an almost impossible dilemma which is either choose a side or leave home , '' he told a separate news conference in the Afghan capital . \nThe U.N. World Food Program also said Wednesday that two to three million people across Afghanistan are likely to need extra food aid from September following drought and a poor wheat harvest this year . \nWhile the number of insurgent suicide attacks in Afghanistan was largely unchanged , the number of civilians they killed soared by half , the largest increase in deaths from any tactic . \nInsurgents who have been squeezed in some of their traditional heartlands have tried spectacular urban attacks to underline their reach as NATO troops race to prepare Afghan forces for a security handover which begins this year . \n`` Suicide attacks in 2011 have become more complex , often using multiple bombers in spectacular attacks that kill many Afghan civilians , '' found the report . \nEight Afghan civilians and one foreigner were killed last month in an assault on Kabul 's Intercontinental hotel , just days after a suicide car bomber killed at least 20 people at a hospital in remote east Afghanistan . \nThere were 190 targeted killings , compared to 181 in the same period of 2010 . \nGround combat caused more than 304 deaths , up more than a third , with 188 of those deaths attributed to insurgents , 66 to pro-government forces and 50 to crossfire . \nControversial night raids by the U.S. military , which Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticised as inciting people to join the Taliban-led insurgency , fell slightly in the first half of 2011 , accounting for 2 percent of all civilian deaths . \n`` However , resentment regarding these raids grew among the Afghan population . \nViolent demonstrations sometimes followed night raids and led to deaths and injuries of civilians . '' \nThe U.N. mission in Afghanistan also said it was concerned by the increasing use of children in the decade-long war , particularly after recording the youngest suicide bomber -- a 12-year-old who killed three civilians and injured 12 on May 1 . \n"}
{"id": "28", "time": "2011-07-13", "text": "DUBAI | Wed Jul 13 , 2011 7:13 am BST DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Saudi Arabia has helped damp down democracy movements sweeping the Arab world but is waiting now to see how events play out in places like Syria and Yemen for fear of overplaying its hand . \nAfter witnessing the sudden collapse of rulers in Egypt and Tunisia this year , the Al Saud family that monopolises power in Saudi Arabia orchestrated Gulf Arab moves to stop the unrest from spreading through the Gulf region . \nSaudi , United Arab Emirates and Kuwaiti forces went to Bahrain in March to help crush protests threatening to force the ruling family there to make democratic changes . \nThey offered money to Oman and Bahrain for more social spending , and Qatar 's Al Jazeera TV toned down its hard-hitting Gulf coverage after meetings between Saudi and Qatari officials . \nRiyadh was the prime mover behind a Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- proposal to enhance relations with Jordan and Morocco in an apparent effort to boost other Arab dynastic systems . \nA Saudi official said Jordan was given $ 400 million -LRB- 251 million pounds -RRB- last month . \nIn March and April it also brokered a peace deal in Yemen , a republic different in size and social make-up to the GCC countries , that was to see President Ali Abdullah Saleh step down one month after forming a cabinet . \nYet following that flurry of interventions , Saudi diplomacy has largely gone quiet , most notably on two fronts where Riyadh has major interests -- Yemen and Syria . \nIts response also has been muted in Libya , a more distant concern for Riyadh . \nAnalysts and diplomats say there are disputes within the ranks of senior princes and officials on whether to take a back seat , intervene more forcefully to stop democratic changes or , in some cases , to back them . \nTurki Al-Rasheed , a Saudi commentator who runs the Saudi In Focus web forum , said the kingdom 's leaders had run out of ideas on how to challenge the movements amid internal disputes and given the lethargy of senior princes holding different briefs . \n`` They are quiet because they did something and it failed . \nBahrain is still boiling . \nThe only card now is to pay the Americans billions for their weapons , '' he said , referring to reports that $ 60 billion in arms purchases from the United States would rise to $ 90 billion . \nThe ruling Al Khalifa family has instituted a national dialogue in Bahrain , but protests continue in neighborhoods of the majority Shi'ite population , who dominated the protest movement . \nDemonstrations rekindled in Oman last week . \nSaudi Arabia has seen only a small number of protests in Shi'ite areas of its Eastern Province . \nStern government warnings and promises of massive social spending have helped hold back a protest movement taking off on its soil . \n`` There is no one single Saudi policy . \nEach issue is handled from a different point of view and they -LRB- the princes -RRB- are all very old and sick , '' Rasheed said . \nDiplomats in Riyadh often say rigor mortis usually sets in with Saudi policy initiatives during the long summer recess . \nOne Saudi commentator who did not wish to be named said there has been division over how to proceed on Yemen . \nInterior Minister Prince Nayef backs Saleh while Crown Prince and Defense Minister Prince Sultan favor alternatives among tribes paid by the kingdom . \nHowever , Sultan , in his 80s , left last month for treatment in New York and Nayef , in his late 70s , also has been abroad for rest and recreation . \nSaleh has been convalescing in a Riyadh hospital since early June when he was badly burnt in an apparent assassination attempt . \nA bomb went off as he and government officials were performing Friday prayers in a mosque at his palace . \nBut Riyadh has made no clear effort to enforce the GCC peace initiative , which Arab and Western diplomats say was largely a Saudi proposal from the beginning . \nGhanem Nuseibah , London-based analyst at Political Capital , said the Saudi family 's first preference for Saleh to remain in power had given way to promoting Hamid Al-Ahmar , a 44-year-old businessman close to U.S. officials . \nThe Saudi ideal is for Saleh 's system of family rule , balancing Saudi-backed tribal forces , to remain intact . \nThis is exactly what the democracy activists who first took to the streets of Sanaa in January want to avoid . \nBut fighting between tribesmen of Sadeq Al-Ahmar , head of the Hashed tribal confederation , and government forces loyal to Saleh -- whose military and security apparatus are headed by his extended family -- broke out in May . \nThis confounded Saudi efforts at that stage to engineer cosmetic change . \nNow Riyadh is holding on to Saleh while it weighs its options on who can be the most effective strongman among the tribes it funded during Saleh 's 33 years of rule , Nuseibah said . \nNuseibah said even Yemeni tribal figures close to Riyadh have expressed frustration with Saudi inaction . \n`` They see the way the Saudis have reacted since the beginning , '' he said . \n`` First they were pro-Saleh , then they bring Saleh to Riyadh but still letting him be a figurehead for the current regime , though he is not personally ruling . '' \nSaudi relations with Syria have been strained since the murder in 2005 of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri , a Saudi citizen and facilitator of Saudi policy in Lebanon where Iran has influence through Shi'ite group Hezbollah . \nRiyadh accuses Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad of helping Iran in a policy of extending its influence in Arab countries , primarily through its alliance with Lebanon 's Hezbollah . \nBut while Al Jazeera and Saudi mouthpiece Al Arabiya TV have focussed heavily on Damascus 's attempt to crush protests , there have been no diplomatic initiatives to resolve the conflict , as France , Turkey and the United States have dominated international reaction to the turmoil in Syria . \nSome Saudis say this is not because the ruling clique -- King Abdullah , Nayef , Sultan and a few other senior princes -- do no want to see Assad removed from power . \n`` With Libya and Syria , I 'm sure the government would like to see those leaders fall , but in their own time , without getting involved , '' the Saudi commentator who requested anonymity said . \n`` Naturally Saudi Arabia , being a kingdom , sees any sudden change in power that 's now happening in the Middle East as a threat that might be contagious at some point , '' he added . \n"}
{"id": "322", "time": "2011-07-13", "text": "Credit : Reuters\\/Social Media Website via REUTERS TV DAMASCUS | Wed Jul 13 , 2011 1:22 pm EDT DAMASCUS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The byline has been withheld to protect the writer and those interviewed for the story . \nReuters correspondents were expelled from Syrian shortly after unrest began in March . \nSocial media played a pivotal role in the ousting of Arab leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , but activists in an uprising in Syria fear Syria the government is keeping tabs on them by scanning websites such as Facebook and Twitter . \n`` I am too scared to speak about my political activity on Facebook , '' said a 21-year-old activist , who asked to be referred to as Rana . \n`` I 'm not going to open a Twitter account , '' she said , referring to the micro-blogging website where users post 140-character `` Tweets . '' \nRana 's fears stem from the widespread belief that government hackers are browsing the Internet to search for dissidents and tracking them down via social media websites . \nAnother activist , who asked to be referred to as Ammar , said he used to post anti-government comments on his Facebook page but stopped after his uncle , who is a member of the ruling Baath Party and works closely with local security , warned him that his name had come up as a dissident . \n`` My uncle told me that I 'm now on a list of people who the -LRB- Syrian -RRB- security are keeping an eye on . \n-LRB- My uncle said -RRB- it must be because security were scanning my Facebook activity , '' he said at a cafe in the Old City of Damascus . \nIn May , U.S. officials told the Washington Post that Iran had started providing the Syrian government with sophisticated surveillance equipment to assist in tracking down opponents via the Internet . \nOfficials said the same techniques were used in Iran to crush a pro-democracy `` Green Movement '' in 2009 . \nBoth Iran and Syria deny that Tehran is sending equipment to help the Syrian government spy on its own citizens . \nSince taking power in 2000 , President Bashar al-Assad 's government has sought to stifle dissent by banning websites like Facebook , where users can interact with other members outside Syria . \nMany Internet cafes in Damascus started using web proxies to bypass the block and gain access to Facebook , but earlier this year Syrians suddenly found they could get onto the site . \nActivists say it was a ploy . \n`` The government reopened Facebook because they realized that it was more useful for them to allow activists to communicate on the site , and then track us down using their team of loyalists who search the Internet , '' Rana said . \nBut pro-Assad Syrians have come out in the thousands to voice their support for the president online , another possible reason for unblocking social media websites . \nAn online battle has ensued in which pro- and anti-government users have created Facebook groups to support or condemn the government . \n`` It is important to show my love for my president on Facebook , because many people outside Syria think that there is a revolution in Syria against Assad , but that 's not true , '' Muhammad Merei , a student from the coastal town of Lattakia , told Reuters in a Facebook message . \n`` They wanted to -LRB- create -RRB- a civil war , they attacked the army and killed many people , '' he added . \nMerei , who has a picture of Assad on his Facebook page , is a member of dozens of pro-Assad Facebook groups , including one dedicated to closing the prominent dissident group , `` Syrian Revolution 2011 . '' \nOne Facebook group , titled `` Bashar Al-Asad , '' has more than 192,000 followers . \nDuring the Egyptian revolution , which started in January , activists would use social media to organize demonstrations . \nIn Syria , a country of 20 million , activists say that would be too risky . \n`` There are Facebook groups that organize protests , but they only give the location of the protest at the very last minute , '' Rana told Reuters at her apartment in Damascus . \n`` You do n't know what time it will start until just before it actually starts . '' \nRana , and other Internet-savvy activists , worry that hackers will discover the time and location of the demonstration and send police to arrest anyone who shows up . \nLandlines and mobile phones are tapped and Syrians who want to buy a SIM card have to provide identification and a thumbprint . \nInstead , activists try to organize demonstrations by word of mouth or on instant messaging Internet programs , which they say are harder to track . \nDiplomats in Damascus say the fear of using the Internet has been one reason why anti-government protests have not achieved the same turnout as demonstrations in Cairo of Sanaa , Yemen 's capital , where more than 100,000 people have rallied for the overthrow of President Ali Abdullah Saleh . \n`` Fear is a big factor , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters at his home in Damascus . \n`` But there are also still a lot of Assad loyalists in the capital and the government has a strong security presence here . '' \nSyria 's protests started in poverty-stricken rural provinces , where Internet usage is low . \nStill , activists know the Internet is essential to get information out of the country and , often , social media websites are the only option . \nMost foreign journalists are barred from working in Syria and local media outlets self-censor . \nThe press coverage has come mostly from exiled human rights activists , anonymous Syrian bloggers and videos of demonstrations uploaded to YouTube . \n`` I have a blog , but I 'll never use my real name , '' said Ammar , the Syrian activist who regularly attends protests in the Damascus suburbs . \n`` We need more people in Syria to talk about the atrocities that are happening here . '' \nIn his spare time , Ammar makes short films on his laptop using footage he finds on YouTube of police firing on protesters . \nHe hopes the videos will help to keep interest in Syria high as the unrest draws out into the summer months . \nBut pro-Assad Syrians have sought to discredit many of the videos on YouTube , saying they are faked or the footage is not genuine . \nIndeed , some of the videos posted by anti-Assad protesters were later discovered to have come from neighboring Iraq or Lebanon , during civil unrest . \nActivists know footage of peaceful demonstrations will serve to diminish the government 's credibility and have started filming protests live over the Internet to prevent government loyalists from challenging the video 's authenticity . \nIn the past few weeks , satellite TV networks have aired live footage of demonstrations in the city of Hama , the scene of some of the biggest anti-Assad demonstrations and of a brutal crackdown by his father nearly 30 years ago . \nAssad deployed tanks outside the city last week . \nBut the Syrian government , Ammar said , is trying very hard to outwit bloggers and human rights activists . \n`` On days when a lot of people are killed , the government will just shut down the Internet . \nThen nobody knows .

'' \nThe United Nations , France and the United States condemned the violence . \nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a `` transparent investigation '' into the killings and for those responsible to be held accountable . \n`` We are deeply concerned by the Syrian government 's use of violence , intimidation and arbitrary arrests to hinder the ability of its people to freely exercise their universal rights , '' said U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner . \n`` We call on the Syrian government to exercise restraint and refrain from violence against these peaceful protesters . '' \nThose killed included Ali Ghassab al-Mahamid , a doctor from a prominent Deraa family who went to the Omari mosque to help victims of the attack . \nAn official Syrian statement said : `` Outside parties are transmitting lies about the situation in Deraa , '' blaming what it described as armed gangs for the violence . \nIt said they had `` stocked weapons and ammunition in the mosque and kidnapped children and used them as human shields . '' \nState television showed guns , grenades and ammunition it said were found in the mosque , but activists said the protest was peaceful and there had been no weapons . \nAn official statement said later that Assad had sacked Deraa governor Faisal Kalthoum . \nBut a main demand of the protesters is an end to what they term as repression by the secret police , headed in Deraa province by a cousin of Assad . \nThe Baath Party has banned opposition and enforced emergency laws since 1963 . \nBut the wave of Arab unrest which has toppled leaders in Tunisia and Egypt presents Assad with the biggest challenge to his rule since he succeeded his father Hafez al-Assad , who ruled Syria for 30 years until his death in 2000 . \nAssad , a close ally of Iran , a key player in neighboring Lebanon and supporter of militant groups opposed to Israel , has dismissed rising demands for fundamental reform in Syria where his Baath Party has held a monopoly on power for 48 years . \nFormer colonial power France urged Damascus to carry out political reforms without delay and respect its commitment to human rights . \nOn Tuesday , Vice President Farouq al-Shara said Assad was committed to `` continue the path of reform and modernization in Syria , '' Lebanon 's al-Manar television reported . \nAuthorities arrested a leading campaigner who had supported the protesters , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday . \nIt said Loay Hussein , a political prisoner from 1984 to 1991 , was taken from his home near Damascus . \nIn Damascus , authorities released six female protesters on Wednesday who took part in a silent demonstration last week supporting the release of political prisoners , lawyers said . \nAssad has lifted some bans on private enterprise but ignored calls to end emergency law , curb a pervasive security apparatus , develop rule of law and freedom of expression , free political prisoners and reveal the fate of tens of thousands of dissidents who disappeared in the 1980s . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOnly time will tell how this will end up like in Yemen , Bahrain , and Libya . \nI find it difficult to believe that some people in the Western countries can not see the obvious importance of supporting the democratic movement sweeping the Middle East . \nEven if we forget about humanitarian reasons , the vital economic and strategic interests of Western countries are highly rewarded in the support of democratic societies in that area : less hatred of the West , less radical authoritarian leaders , less terrorism -LRB- read less murders of civilians in the West -RRB- , more economic cooperation and reception of Western investment , more mutual trade , more stabilized oil market and more political stability in those countries . \nThis is not the same `` war '' as the previous two . \nthe Western countries are here being clamored for by the democratic insurgents , who will be grateful and willing economic and political partners of Western countries when they fully establish themselves in government . \nThere are no Western or American flags being burnt by the insurgents this time round in the various Arab countries where insurgents are demanding democratic freedom and liberation from their barbaric , regressive and oppressive tyrants . \nIt is no wonder that many autocratic Arab countries are hesitant to support the democratic movements in their other countries , since they feel like turkeys voting for Christmas . \nit is also not a surprise that China , Russia , Iran and Venezuela are adamant that the democratic movements in those countries should not be supported or protected by the Western countries . \nOf course we would all like to spend less on military activities and more on education and other socially necessary items within Western societies . \nBut think : Should Britain have abstained from involvement in the Second World War against the Axis because it was already quite indebted and needed money for domestic programs ? \nShould the US not have gotten involved in the Second World War because it was costly ? \nShould the US not have spent enormous amounts of money during the Cold War to stop the spread of communism because of money being needed domestically ? \nDoes the West really want to continue coexisting with all those tyrannical and retrograde regimes in the Arab countries that hate the West and surreptitiously foster terrorism against it ? \nIf the West does nothing to help those insurgents , it will end up on the wrong side of history , much to its detriment on all fronts . \nThe Arab World is falling apart . \nThe Arab League must get together and send Troops into the Countries having problems and use deadly force if necessary to get things under control , then keep the peace . \nUnderstand I 'm not aagainst protesting , It must be allowed and the governments must stop using deadly force on peacefull protesters . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nasked Mohamed Abdou , who was outside the court . \nMubarak and his two sons , Alaa and Gamal , have been charged in connection with the killing of demonstrators . \nAbout 850 died in the 18-day uprising that ousted the president on February 11 . \n` WHY TAKE ALL THIS TIME ?

'' \nsaid Foad Kamal , who works in a supermarket chain . \nHe had come to the court expecting a verdict . \nAbout 300 people were injured in Cairo Saturday when thousands of demonstrators fought opponents with stones on a march to the Defense Ministry to urge the ruling military council to speed up reforms . \nActivists blamed the violence on thugs who they said were encouraged by the authorities . \nThe army has dismissed the charges and said it did not use force against demonstrators . \nMilitary police , armed with Tasers and batons , held back protesters as police fired tear gas . \n`` What happened Saturday was a planned attack against peaceful protesters who aim to keep up pressure on the military council to bring about faster reforms , '' said Mohamed Fahmy , a member of the Youth Coalition of the Revolution . \n`` We will continue to muster people on the street next Friday . \nWe will respond in peaceful protest to Saturday 's events , '' Fahmy said . \nProtesters have increasingly criticised the army and arranged coordinated demonstrations in Cairo and the port cities of Alexandria and Suez . \nThe cabinet pledged Monday to clear out officials who held senior posts in Mubarak 's era , continue with public trials and press on with other reforms , such as setting a maximum wage for higher paid officials within a month . \nFive police officers were referred to trial for inciting violence on February2 , when Mubarak loyalists charged protesters in Tahrir Square on camels and horses , a judicial source said . \nSeparately , the military prosecution questioned former prime minister Ahmed Nazif over a charge of facilitating the sale of army land to a businessman , the state news agency said . \n"}
{"id": "72", "time": "2011-03-15", "text": "NEW YORK | Tue Mar 15 , 2011 11:07 pm GMT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP -LRB- KKR . \nN -RRB- is increasing the sources of capital it taps as it gears up to raise its next buyout fund , the company said at its first ever investor day on Tuesday . \nKKR , which raised an $ 18 billion global buyout fund in 2006 , is just starting to raise a new North American-focused fund with a target size of $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion . \nPrivate equity firms raise capital that they typically use to buy companies , turn them around and sell for a higher price , returning the profit to the investors that supplied the capital . \nThe credit crisis limited dealflow and made raising capital for new funds hard , as investors were less willing and able to commit capital to new funds . \nThe harder fundraising environment has caused funds have to search out new investors . \nNuttall said that KKR , which has 350 fund investors or `` limited partners , '' is working on adding more . \nArch-rival Blackstone Group -LRB- BX . \nN -RRB- has more than 1,300 , a source close to the company said . \n`` It is incumbent on us -- and we will do this in the next fundraise that we are in process of doing for North America -- to find other sources of capital that are not invested in us , '' co-founder and co-Chief Executive George Roberts said . \nMore money is being attracted to the alternative investment space , increasingly from new investors , co-founder and co-CEO Henry Kravis said . \nKKR said it has more than $ 11 billion of `` dry powder , '' or capital available to invest , and sees potential deals around the world . \n`` We believe that is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe , '' said Alexander Navab , KKR 's co-head of North American private equity . \nLeveraged buyouts -- the debt-fueled deals private equity is known for -- have been increasing in the past year as financing for deals has become easier to find . \nKKR said North America is attractive for private equity , with improved credit markets and `` generally reasonable '' equity valuations . \nThe company 's European head said KKR sees opportunities in France and the financial services sector . \nIn Asia , KKR cited opportunities in China and said Japan looks attractive from a pure valuation point of view . \nIt is seeking large transactions in markets such as Australia , Singapore , Korea , Japan and India . \nKKR 's $ 11 billion includes $ 3.5 billion of uncommitted capital remaining in its 2006 fund , which will probably prove one of the strongest of its vintage , said Michael Michelson , co-head of North American private equity . \nKKR also raised more than $ 1 billion for a China fund in record time for the firm , Navab said . \nHowever , its European Fund II is valued at 93 percent of cost , which KKR described as `` disappointing -LRB- but -RRB- an improvement on 2009 . '' \nRoberts said KKR probably paid too much for a couple of deals , which was `` probably why Europe II is still not performing '' as it thinks it should . \nIn November Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher suggested that a bubble is forming in private equity , with cheap debt fueling high-priced deals in an echo of the torrid days of LBOs before the subprime credit crisis cut off financing in 2007 . \nKKR remains focused on buyouts even though it has expanded over the past few years into areas such as real estate and capital markets . \n`` Private equity is our heritage , our core business , and we 've been able to build a number of businesses around it , '' Scott Nuttall , global head of capital and asset management , said at the event , which was attended by about 100 investors . \nKKR said it was confident its new long-short team would be in the market soon and raise significant capital over time . \nLast October , KKR hired nine members of Goldman Sachs Group Inc 's -LRB- GS . \nN -RRB- proprietary trading team . \n`` Buyout king '' Kravis , who co-founded KKR nearly 35 years ago , said he and co-founder Roberts think about succession issues every day but added that their stepping down , `` I hope is in the distant future .

'' \nThe U.S. Department of Energy said it had sent a team of 34 people to help Japan with the crisis . \nJapanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Tuesday urged people within 30 km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- of the facility -- a population of 140,000 -- to remain indoors , as authorities grappled with the world 's most serious nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 . \nOfficials in Tokyo said radiation in the capital was 10 times normal at one point but not a threat to human health in the sprawling high-tech city of 13 million people . \nToxicologist Lee Tin-lap at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said such a radiation level was not an immediate threat to people but the long-term consequences were unknown . \n`` You are still breathing this into your lungs , and there is passive absorption in the skin , eyes and mouth and we really do not know what long-term impact that would have , '' Lee told Reuters by telephone . \nWinds over the plant will blow from the north along the Pacific coast early on Wednesday and then from the northwest towards the ocean during the day , the Japan Meteorological Agency said . \nFears of trans-Pacific nuclear fallout sent consumers scrambling for radiation antidotes in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canada . \nAuthorities warned people would expose themselves to other medical problems by needlessly taking potassium iodide in the hope of protection from cancer . \nThe nuclear crisis and concerns about the economic impact from last week 's earthquake and tsunami hammered Japan 's stock market on Tuesday . \nThe Nikkei index fell as much as 14 percent before ending down 10.6 percent , compounding a slide of 6.2 percent the day before . \nThe two-day fall has wiped some $ 620 billion off the market . \nAuthorities have spent days desperately trying to prevent the water which is designed to cool the radioactive cores of the reactors from evaporating , which would lead to overheating and the release of dangerous radioactive material into the atmosphere . \n`` The possibility of further radioactive leakage is heightening , '' a grim-faced Kan said in his address to the nation on Tuesday . \n`` We are making every effort to prevent the leak from spreading . \nI know that people are very worried but I would like to ask you to act calmly . '' \nLevels of 400 millisieverts per hour had been recorded near the No. 4 reactor , the government said . \nExposure to over 100 millisieverts a year is a level which can lead to cancer , according to the World Nuclear Association . \nThe plant operator , Tokyo Electric Power Co. , pulled out 750 workers , leaving just 50 , and a 30-km -LRB- 19 mile -RRB- no-fly zone was imposed around the reactors . \nThere have been no detailed updates on what levels the radiation reached inside the exclusion zone . \nA Reuters reporter using a Geiger counter showed negligible levels of radiation in the capital late on Tuesday . \nDespite pleas for calm , residents rushed to shops in Tokyo to stock up on supplies . \nDon Quixote , a multi-storey , 24-hour general store in Roppongi district , sold out of radios , flashlights , candles and sleeping bags . \nIn a sign of regional fears about the risk of radiation , China said it would evacuate its citizens from areas worst affected but it had detected no abnormal radiation levels at home . \nAir China said it had canceled some flights to Tokyo . \nThe U.S. Navy said some arriving warships would deploy on the west coast of Japan 's main Honshu island instead of heading to the east coast as planned because of `` radiological and navigation hazards . '' \nSeveral embassies advised staff and citizens to leave affected areas in Japan . \nTourists cut short vacations and multinational companies either urged staff to leave or said they were considering plans to move outside Tokyo . \nGerman technology companies SAP and Infineon were among those moving staff to safety in the south . \nSAP said it was evacuating its offices in Tokyo , Osaka and Nagoya and had offered its 1,100 employees and their family members transport to the south , where the company has rented a hotel for staff to work online . \n`` Everyone is going out of the country today , '' said Gunta Brunner , a 25-year-old creative director from Argentina preparing to board a flight at Narita airport . \n`` With the radiation , it 's like you can not escape and you ca n't see it . '' \n`` WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? '' \nJapanese media have became more critical of Kan 's handling of the disaster and criticised the government and the nuclear plant operator for their failure to provide enough information on the incident . \nKan himself lambasted the operator for taking so long to inform his office about one of the blasts on Tuesday , Kyodo news agency reported . \nKyodo said Kan had ordered TEPCO not to pull employees out of the plant . \n`` The TV reported an explosion . \nBut nothing was said to the premier 's office for about an hour , '' a Kyodo reporter quoted Kan telling power company executives . \n`` What the hell is going on ? '' \nNuclear radiation is an especially sensitive issue for Japanese following the country 's worst human catastrophe -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 . \nThere have been a total of four explosions at the plant since it was damaged in last Friday 's massive quake and tsunami . \nThe most recent were blasts at reactors Nos. 2 and 4 . \nConcern now centres on damage to a part of the No. 4 reactor building where spent rods were being stored in pools of water outside the containment area , and also to part of the No. 2 reactor that helps to cool and trap the majority of cesium , iodine and strontium in its water . \nBefore Tuesday 's explosion the temperature in Number 4 reactor 's cooling pool was 84 C , higher than normal due to a lack of electricity after the quake , said Hidehiko Nishiyama , chief spokesman of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency . \nSince then the temperature had been rising and there was a possibility that it was boiling , he said . \nIt would take 7-10 days for the water to boil away , leaving the spent fuel rods exposed to the air , said Kazuya Aoki , a director for safety examination . \nAs long as the spent fuel rods were covered with water there should be no leak of radioactive material from them , he said . \nOfficials were considering options including using helicopters to pour water into the reactor pool , though the openings created by the explosion were on the north and west sides of the reactor , making it difficult to access from above . \nVILLAGES AND TOWNS WIPED OFF THE MAP The full extent of the destruction from last Friday 's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the tsunami that followed it was becoming clear as rescuers combed through the region north of Tokyo where officials say at least 10,000 people were killed . \nWhole villages and towns have been wiped off the map by Friday 's wall of water , triggering an international humanitarian effort of epic proportions . \nA 6.4-magnitude aftershock -- a significant earthquake in its own right on any other day -- shook buildings in Tokyo late on Tuesday but caused no damage . \nAbout 850,000 households in the north were still without electricity in near-freezing weather , Tohuku Electric Power Co. said , and the government said at least 1.5 million households lack running water . \nTens of thousands of people were missing . \nHiromichi Shirakawa , chief economist for Japan at Credit Suisse , said in a note to clients that the economic loss will likely be around 14-15 trillion yen -LRB- $ 171-183 billion -RRB- just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami . \nThe earthquake has forced many firms to suspend production and global companies -- from semiconductor makers to shipbuilders -- face disruptions to operations after the quake and tsunami destroyed vital infrastructure , damaged ports and knocked out factories . \n`` The earthquake could have great implications on the global economic front , '' said Andre Bakhos , director of market analytics at Lec Securities in New York . \n`` If you shut down Japan , there could be a global recession .

'' \nAs part of the package , interest on European bailout loans to Greece will be cut to around 3.5 percent from roughly 4 percent now . \nMaturities on these loans will be doubled to a minimum of 15 years and extended to as much as 30 years , with a grace period of 10 years . \nIn addition , private creditors will be offered a menu of options including bond swaps , a rollover into debt with maturities of up to 30 years , and a buyback of bonds , involving a loss of about 21 percent on the face value of the debt . \nThe European Union estimated the private sector would contribute 50 billion euros on a net basis through mid-2014 , of which 37 billion euros -LRB- 32.6 billion pounds -RRB- would come from debt exchanges and 12.6 billion euros from the bond buyback . \nTogether , the steps will cause a major reduction in financial pressure on Greece . \nThanks to the first bailout of Athens , about 40 billion euros of its 340 billion euro debt is in the form of EU loans , and the proportion will rise ; the grace period means Athens will not have to be make payments on this part of the debt for 10 years . \nThe IMF may offer similar relief on its loans , which are half the size of the EU 's . \nAlso , the bond swaps and buyback will reduce the bond redemptions which Athens will have to meet between 2015 and 2020 . \nCombined with the primary budget surpluses which Greece is projected to start running next year , it may have minimal market funding needs for the rest of this decade . \nPrime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday that the country 's funding needs would be covered up to 2020 . \nReducing Greece 's funding needs is different from cutting its debt mountain to levels that the markets will consider safe and sustainable over the long term , however . \nMany private analysts think that at the very least , the debt\\/GDP ratio needs to be cut below 100 percent , and some suggest 80 percent ; EU rules stipulate 60 percent . \nIt is not clear whether the projected 50 billion euro contribution which the EU expects from the private sector refers entirely to reductions in Greece 's debt . \nAssuming it does , the debt ratio could fall to around 130 percent in 2014 . \nAssuming further that Greece can meet its ambitious target of raising a full 50 billion euros from privatisations by 2015 -- a risky assumption -- and then uses all the money to reduce debt , it would reach a ratio of 105-110 percent of GDP . \n`` It cuts a big chunk of debt . \nYou can not say it brings sustainability . \nGreece is given the best possible environment to bring its house in order , but it needs to deliver on strong reforms and privatisation , '' said Marco Valli , chief euro zone economist at Unicredit . \nAn important factor in the equation is economic growth , which both reduces the size of the debt in relation to the economy and improves Greece 's fiscal position by generating tax revenues . \nSo far , the numbers have been negative ; Greece 's economy shrank 4.5 percent last year , worse than the 4.0 percent contraction assumed in the first bailout plan , and the IMF now expects it to shrink 3.9 percent this year , instead of the 3.0 percent decrease envisioned by the plan . \nThe IMF now predicts meager growth of 0.6 percent for next year . \nEuro zone leaders are now focussing on this issue , pledging a `` Marshall Plan '' for Greece to stimulate its economy , but so far the effort seems mainly to comprise speeding up and making more efficient the use of development aid funds allocated by the EU . \nAnalysts doubt this is by itself enough to support strong growth . \nWithout a currency devaluation , denied to Greece by its membership of the euro zone , the country may take years to achieve the productivity gains required to improve its economic competitiveness . \n`` Necessary steps have been taken , but I 'm not sure that they are sufficient , '' said ING senior euro zone economist Martin van Vliet . \nHe said another exercise to make private creditors write off Greek debt could not be ruled out down the road . \nThe latest bailout plan seeks to prevent Greece 's problem from destabilising the rest of Europe , `` but it 's not guaranteed that this is the beginning of the end of the crisis . '' \nDavid Mackie , head of western European economic research at JP Morgan , said one 's view of Greece 's capacity to rein in its debt essentially depended on gut assumptions . \n`` The two critical issues are to what extent the funding will be met and how long a time horizon you are prepared to accept . \nIf you give it 10 years then it does n't look so bad . \nIf you think targets will be missed , which is not an unreasonable assumption , then it clearly looks worse .

'' \nOddo Securities analyst Yan Derocles said he found the valuation of both the Vizada and Satair deals `` rather high '' . \nAccording to EADS , Vizada expects to generate around $ 660 million in revenue and $ 95 million in earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation this year . \nVizada was formed in 2007 from satellite services held by France Telecom -LRB- FTE . \nPA -RRB- and Norway 's Telenor -LRB- TEL. . \nThe deal is EADS 's second-largest acquisition after a 2.75 billion euro buyout of BAE Systems ' -LRB- BAES . \nL -RRB- 20 percent stake in Airbus in 2006 . \nUnder pressure from analysts to look at better uses for an 11 billion euro net cash surplus , EADS has long said it is ready to spend up to 2 billion euros to fund external growth . \nBut the pace quickened after it lost a contest with Boeing -LRB- BA . \nN -RRB- , the world 's largest aerospace company , to supply air tankers to the Pentagon in March . \nThe setback removed a chance to make the U.S. a bigger launchpad for internal growth . \nEADS has said it would be prepared to look at European companies with a foothold in U.S. defense to gain entry . \nApax Partners said the deal marked its third exit in the telecom sector in two months following sales of Prosodie and Outremer Telecom . \nIt and Vizada were both advised by UBS . \nEADS was advised by Messier Partners . \n"}
{"id": "305", "time": "2011-08-01", "text": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist . \nThe opinions expressed are his own . \nA young Syrian called Ausama Monajed was on a train to London . \nOne of his hobbies was reading e-books . \nOn this trip , he picked Gene Sharp s From Dictatorship to Democracy , which maps out strategies for using non-violent struggle to bring down repressive regimes . \nMonajed , now one of the revolution s leaders outside the country , became engrossed . \nIt was as if I was reading an exact description of Syria , Monajed told Reuters Breakingviews . \nThe next thing he noticed was a conductor tapping him on the shoulder . \nThe train had arrived at its terminus in Euston Station . \nHe asked me if I wanted to return where I d come from . \nSharp , who was inspired by India s Mohandas Gandhi and who himself influenced some of the activists behind the Egyptian revolution , stresses that a dictator s power isn t monolithic . \nIt relies on the army , police , civil service , business and , indeed , the wider society just to function . \nActivists should therefore analyze those pillars of support and systematically undermine them . \nThe best way to do this is not to fight dictators with their own weapons - matching violence with violence in a struggle they are likely to lose but to use non-violent tactics . \nIt is much harder for the security forces to kill unarmed civilians than those who fire back at you . \nThe more brutally the regime represses them , the shakier its pillars of support become . \nEventually , the violence boomerangs on the regime and destroys it . \nSharp makes clear that non-violent struggles normally don t succeed through spontaneous combustion . \nThey need planning and training . \nMost importantly , it is vital to maintain nonviolent discipline which isn t easy when activists are being killed , tortured and detained . \nMonajed , now 31 , was smitten . \nAn economist by training , he had hoped that Syria s president Bashar al-Assad would be a reformer when he succeeded his father Hafez Assad , who died in 2000 . \nMonajed worked for the United National Development Programme and then the European Commission on development programs inside Syria . \nBut then he became disillusioned and joined the opposition . \nAfter being arrested several times , Monajed quit the country in 2005 and has never returned . \nHe says he has become one of the regime s most wanted people after writing an article in the Washington Post this April . \nThis said the U.S. government had several years ago funded Barada TV , a London-based channel beaming anti-regime programming into Syria which he had helped establish . \nAfter coming across Sharp s work , Monajed studied previous nonviolent revolutions , especially the Serbs overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 . \nHe went to see Sharp , now an 83-year-old academic , in Boston . \nHe also wrote a master s degree dissertation on the role of the internet and information technology in non-violent struggle with a focus on Syria . \nIn 2007 Monajed organized a meeting with some disaffected Syrian friends in London . \nHe says it is too risky to reveal their names . \nThey decided to get trained in the techniques of nonviolent struggle and use that as the basis for training others . \nWe brought Syrians out of the country and trained them in nonviolent techniques , Monajed says . \nThe idea was to train leaders and send them back to train others . \nThey found it hard to recruit volunteers . \nThey were told nonviolent struggle wouldn t work in Syria because of religious and geopolitical factors . \nIn the end , they managed to train around 100 people . \nThen came the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . \nThe whole Middle East was electrified . \nSyrians began to think they too might get their freedom . \nPeople contacted Monajed s group , saying that now they understood what it was advocating . \nThe first protest took place on March 15 in the Hamidiyeh bazaar in the heart of old Damascus . \nThey chose Hamidiyeh because it is a covered market . \nThere were only about 40 protesters but their chants , calling for freedom , echoed off the iron roof making it seem like there were more . \nBecause the bazaar was crowded , it was hard to distinguish who was a protestor and who was just an onlooker - again exaggerating their numbers . \nThe next protests took place spontaneously in Deraa , near the border with Jordan , after 15 school children had been arrested for scrawling anti-regime graffiti on walls . \nThese protests were much bigger , with thousands eventually taking part . \nThe security services fired on unarmed civilians . \nThe killing began in earnest . \nAfter that , protests started mushrooming around the country . \nFacebook pages were created ; people communicated via Twitter ; protesters took video clips with their mobile phones and posted them on YouTube . \nEverything was happening faster than Monajed and his colleagues had imagined . \nMost of the protests had nothing to do with them . \nThe challenge was how to put some order into the revolution . \nAn early priority was to set up a virtual operation center , staffed by dozens of volunteers outside the country , feeding what was happening on the ground to the world outside . \nMost foreign journalists were quickly kicked out of the country , including one Reuters journalist who was beaten up by the secret police , so it was important to get information out to the international media . \nMany of the most popular internet pages were coordinated through a new body , The Coalition of Syrian Pages . \nOn the ground , local coordinating committees started emerging in different neighborhoods . \nThey organize campaigns , raise money to cover living costs of the families of those who had been killed or detained , and help communicate what is happening in their area . \nThe Coalition of Syrian Pages has gradually taken a bigger role in coordinating activity . \nIt consists of about 20-25 people , some inside the country and some abroad . \nMonajed won t reveal their names . \nThe authorities don t know who all the members of the Coalition are or where they are , he explains . \nOne of the current priorities is to have a strategic plan that includes action on the ground and international lobbying for things like an oil embargo . \nThis has involved coordinating the work of the activists , most of whom are young , with the traditional cohort of opposition made up of politicians , lawyers and human rights campaigners , many of whom signed the anti-regime Damascus Declaration in 2005 . \nInitially there wasn t a plan ; just an idea of demonstrating until the regime falls , says Monajed . \nNow , with the Coalition , we are trying to guide the effort in a strategic manner to knock down the -LRB- regime s -RRB- pillars of support . \nA particularly sensitive issue , which didn t exist in either Egypt or Tunisia , is the potential for sectarian conflict . \nAssad is an Alawite , a minority Shi ite Muslim sect . \nMany of the top positions in government , the military and business are also held by Alawites . \nBut most of the population is Sunni Muslim . \nGiven this background , the regime s four main pillars of support in order of importance , according to Monajed , are : the security forces including secret police ; the Alawites ; army generals , especially those who are Alawite ; and the Sunni business elite , many of whom have prospered since Assad partly liberalised the economy . \nIn order to knock down these pillars , it is essential to keep the campaign peaceful , says Monajed . \nPeople don t want a Libyanisation of the situation , he says , referring to the civil war across the Mediterranean Sea . \nSo demonstrators give roses to the army and don t insult them in their chants . \nThe underlying message they are trying to send to the top generals is : We differentiate between you and the security service . \nSome soldiers have mutinied after being ordered to kill unarmed protesters . \nThe message to the Alawites is that they are being held hostage by the Assad regime - and it can t be in their interests to engage in a war of elimination . \nThe protesters have used chants stressing the unity between Sunni , Alawites and Christians -LRB- another minority -RRB- and called on Alawite and Christian generals to lead the transition to democracy . \nDespite this , there are signs of sectarian violence . \nThere has already been at least one case of a group of Alawites being killed -- in retaliation for a Sunni elder being killed and cut into pieces , according to Monajed . \nThat , in turn , provoked a ferocious backlash against Sunnis in the city of Homs . \nMeanwhile , the message to the business community is that they won t continue to prosper under Assad . \nThe Syrian pound has fallen on the black market , tourism is dead , consumer demand has been thwacked and the economy is shrinking . \nWhat about the secret police ? \nThis is the toughest part of the regime to crack , according to Monajed . \nHe doesn t have a simple message for them . \nRather , he predicts that , as the revolution goes on , the regime will get tired and exhausted . \nThe top generals may then liaise with Alawite leaders , arrest Assad and the top security chiefs , and form a transitional council with members from all parts of the community . \nWhile strategizing is important , nothing will happen without action on the ground . \nAlthough protests have been the most visible tactic , they are not the only method being deployed . \nThere are low-risk tactics for those who don t want to go on protests where they could get killed . \nOne is to release freedom balloons at a specific time in a particular city , to give people courage that they are not alone . \nAnother is to open their windows at night time and play revolutionary rap songs . \nActivists have drawn up lists of shame of businesses , actors , intellectuals , imams and priests who are considered too close to the regime . \nThese are used to determine boycotts and strikes . \nCampaigners have also produced lists of government informers , according to the Financial Times . \nTheir aim is to put pressure on them and isolate them . \nHowever , there are also reports of at least two informers being killed . \nThe Assad regime has been far from idle . \nAs of last week , 1,634 civilians had been killed , according to Avaaz , the human rights group . \nThen on Sunday tanks were sent into the central Syrian city of Hama , in what looks like an attempt to break the protesters ' morale before the holy month of Ramadan , which has now started . \nDemonstrations have been particularly big on Fridays after people have gathered to pray in mosques . \nSome protesters have been saying that Ramadan could be like a month of Fridays . \nAs the regime 's violence ramps up , it would be natural for the protesters either to lose courage or to take up arms themselves . \nThe challenge for Monajed 's group will be to ensure that neither happens . \nIf they succeed , they will then have a chance to witness whether a nonviolent struggle can really bring a brutal regime tumbling down . \nRevolutions -- for better or worse -- are flash points in the process of human evolution which can be traced back to advances in technology . \nHistory shows that to be a universal truth . \nFor the so called `` Western World , '' the advent of written Language and Law is the story of Moses . \nThe printing press made it possible for many more humans to have their own copy of the Bible . \nOnce the word got out the next period of unrest gave us the Protestant reformation . \nFast forward to Vietnam . \nAs soon as video of the mayhem became television fodder , government propaganda insisting that people on the other side of the world are somehow less human became repugnant . \nThe Soviet Union disintegrated because their citizens desire for Blue Jeans and MTV made it impossible to maintain the illusion that the West lived in abject poverty . \nLikewise the Internet and World Wide travel have forced the sun shine of truth into every hell hole on the planet . \nOne person with a cell phone can reach out and touch the hearts of more people then the President of the United States . \nAmerica , China , Russia and even Saudi Arabia have had to appease citizens opinion by saying Syria 's is a dictatorship that has to go even though they know full well that such sentiments may be applied at home as well . \nWhat we are witnessing is a none economic kind of creative destruction that will bring down all the pillars of false power -- government corruption , fiat monitory schemes and religious dogma . \nThe American revolution lead to years of instability and adjustments as the theory of individual sovereignty met the reality of human existence . \nWithout the isolation and vast open lands giving the US space and time to experiment ,1776 might just have been another Tienanmen Square or Prague Spring . \nToday the world is moving forward a bit . \nLet us hope there is enough room or someone hurries up and opens the next frontier -- Space -- so we can catch our breath while figuring out how

{"id": "345", "time": "2011-10-03", "text": "SINGAPORE | Mon Oct 3 , 2011 11:27 am BST SINGAPORE -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - When China abandoned its soybean self-sufficiency quest almost 20 years ago and started importing the oilseed feeding its hunger for livestock , it almost single-handedly transformed the industry . \nToday , it 's poised to do the same for corn . \nThe world 's most populous nation is expected to triple corn purchases next crop year and , by its own admission , become a significant importer by 2015 , putting more strain on global food supplies at a time when inflation is gnawing away at economic growth and the population nears seven billion . \nChina has become the dominant force in the global soybean market since emerging as a buyer in the early 1990s . \nIt is now the world 's biggest importer and consumer , taking in some 55 million tonnes , or 60 percent of annual global trade . \nIf the soybean scenario is a precedent for corn -- and traders say all the signs point in that direction -- benchmark corn prices in the United States , the biggest producer , could in the long term exceed the $ 8 a bushel record set in June . \nU.S. stockpiles are expected to fall to their lowest levels in 16 years in 2011\\/12 , an ominous sign of how China 's rising imports will squeeze supply . \nDemand for the grain , crucial to fatten the animals that feed the world 's growing hunger for meat , shows no sign of abating . \nCompetition for supplies with Japan , the world 's biggest corn importer , will intensify and farmers from as far away as Argentina will start planting more acreage while the amount of corn used to make biofuels could shrink . \nDriving this seismic change in the corn industry is a fifth of the world 's population , which has developed a voracious appetite for pork , poultry and eggs that China 's government is striving to make affordable . \nFor Beijing , high food prices are a potential trigger for social unrest it wants to avoid . \n`` There are shifting diet patterns with growing wealth and the middle class in China together with climate change , land degradation and water scarcity , '' said Monika Barthwal-Datta , who heads the food security program at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney . \n`` It means China is going to enter the market in a substantial manner and it is going to compete with other countries in the region that rely on U.S. corn . '' \nGrain stocks and demand are politically charged topics in the world 's second largest economy , and biggest pork consumer , which is particularly conscious about its food security . \nLast year , China returned to importing corn in earnest after years of blocking foreign grain , buying a record 1.57 million tonnes , up 18 times from the previous year , because domestic production just could n't keep up . \nChina is likely to boost imports to four million tonnes in the 2011\\/12 crop year beginning October from an estimated 1.3 million this year , a Reuters poll showed . \nImports could be even higher , with one analyst forecasting China could ask for as much as 9 million tonnes , which would put it on par with Mexico , the world 's second biggest importer . \nCorn , and to a lesser extent wheat , are mainly used as animal feed . \nBut with strong domestic demand eating up what is forecast to be a bumper harvest , and state reserves running low , corn prices have shot up in China , stoking pork prices that in turn have helped propel overall inflation to a three-year high of 6.5 percent in July . \nAn analyst with the China National Grain and Oils Information Centre , a state-run think-tank , said consumption would continue to dwarf domestic supply as the scope to increase production remained limited . \nA bad year for farmers could boost China 's growing dependence on international markets . \n`` If the weather is not good in some years , the deficit will be bigger , '' he said . \nBecause of their market dominance , any changes to the food patterns in the United States or China will have big repercussions for the rest of the world , and grain prices . \n`` Imagine if China gets slightly lesser production , it could translate into additional imports and it is exactly the same situation for the United States , '' said Abdolreza Abbassian , grain analyst at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation . \nChina is currently the world 's second biggest corn consumer . \nSignificant Chinese imports would bolster prices , said Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney . \nAfter falling from their record high in June , prices remain largely unchanged this year , compared with almost 20 percent losses in wheat and a nearly 13 percent decline in soybeans . \n`` The explosion in Chinese imports from 1990 through today has certainly been a key driver in the oilseed market and we think a repeat of that in the corn market would certainly be a very supportive influence on world prices , '' Mathews said . \nRelentless demand has also driven China 's domestic corn prices to an all-time high this month , depleting reserves to less than one month 's supply and worrying a government desperate to control food prices , which on average jumped more than 13 percent in August . \nLARGE PIG FARMS , ETHANOL INDUSTRY Official fears about food inflation are largely behind China 's drive to transform the hog industry from backyard farms to large modern complexes that will require more corn to ensure steady pork supplies . \n`` When you are a backyard farm you can replace corn with some cheap feed input like waste but you take longer to rear pigs , '' said Jean-Yves Chow , a senior industry analyst at Rabobank in Hong Kong . \n`` When you turn to the industrialised model you have a feeding program which is more based on corn and soybean meal and it is pretty much fixed . '' \nRabobank estimates that by 2015 , nearly three-quarters of the pigs in China will be reared in commercial farms compared with 63 percent in 2010 . \nIn 2000 , farms with more than 50 pigs constituted just 26 percent of the output . \nGoing beyond its borders , China 's large corn imports could also threaten feed grain supplies for the U.S. ethanol industry , which consumes 40 percent of the country 's corn output . \nIn drawing up its balance sheet , the U.S. Department of Agriculture has already said that corn for ethanol would drop 100 million bushels in 2011\\/12 to 5 billion bushels from its August forecast . \nTightening corn supplies will make for a more competitive environment and could put some plants at risk even though at this point production levels continue to run strong . \n`` If you see rising demand from food and feed sectors then subsidies on ethanol production in the U.S. do n't make sense at all , '' said Datta . \n`` Focus on biofuels from food grains is quite a dangerous one . '' \nIn the longer term , analysts say higher grain prices will provide a bigger incentive for farmers to boost corn production . \nBrazil and other South American nations are leading the way with investments and farm expansion . \nAfter transforming global agriculture by quintupling their soybean production since 1980 , Brazilian farmers are now on the brink of crop breakthroughs in cotton and corn , long dominated by growers in America . \n`` We should see higher prices opening up new acreage somewhere in the world , '' said Shawn McCambridge , analyst with Jefferies Bache . \n`` I tend to keep drawing back to South America because the U.S. and China both are limited in how much acreage they can divert to corn .

'' \nHaving almost gone to war in the late 1990s over Syria harboring Kurdish militants , the friendship became a virtual poster-child for Erdogan 's foreign policy of `` zero problems with neighbors . '' \nErdogan has holidayed with Assad , their cabinets have held joint meetings , Turkey has become Syria 's biggest trading partner , the neighbors have visa-free travel between them , and Turkey tried to broker a peace deal between Syria and Israel . \nNO GOING OUT ON A LIMB The relationship with Syria has withered as Erdogan tried to encourage Assad , in vain , to make democratic reforms and end the repressive one-party rule of his Baath movement . \nEvents in the Arab Spring of popular protests , according to Sinan Ulgen in a paper published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , have shown Ankara now wants to be on the right side of history and is ready to stand up for issues like human rights even where it imperils ties with incumbent leaders . \nThe patience Erdogan has shown so far with Assad stands in contrast to the speed with which he advised Hosni Mubarak to quit as president of Egypt when street protests erupted there early this year , but that patience appears to have run out . \nThere is genuine outrage in Turkey , a largely secular Muslim country like Syria but also a multi-party democracy , over the brutal repression unleashed since pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the neighboring Arab state last March . \nIn June , after more than 10,000 Syrians fled to Turkey to escape attacks by security forces , Erdogan described the killing of Syrian civilians as acts of savagery . \nYet , his government -- like Syria 's Arab neighbors , however upset they have become about Assad 's behavior , underlined by the recall of several Gulf ambassadors on Monday -- is unlikely to take any unilateral action against Damascus , according to analysts of Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East . \nWith the international community divided over what to do about Syria , Turkey is unlikely to go out on a limb , either through economic sanctions or military action . \n`` Turkey will not go to the lengths of unilateral economic sanctions . \nIt has always argued that sanctions hurt people , not regimes , '' said Semih Idiz , a columnist focused on foreign policy at Milliyet newspaper . \nOne big investment that could be vulnerable to a freeze in bilateral relations is a joint multi-billion-dollar dam project dubbed `` Friendship Dam , '' whose groundbreaking was attended by leaders of the two countries in February . \nTurkey is also likely to resist any pressure to create a buffer zone inside Syrian territory , though it is reportedly a scenario that the Turkish military has made contingencies for . \n`` Turkey will not do anything unilateral militarily unless there is a massive spillover effect from what 's happening in Syria -- a spillover of a humanitarian nature , or a threat to national security , '' Idiz said . \nOther analysts said Turkey should avoid being drawn into any military intervention in Syria just to please Western powers , as it would backfire on efforts to end ethnic Kurds ' long-running insurgency in southeast Turkey . \n`` Turkey may limit its trade and diplomatic ties with Syria . \nBut , even if Turkey does n't take such steps , its clear message and attitude toward the Syrian administration will be a boost of morale to protesters , '' Dincer said . \nSyrians living in exile have flocked to Turkey , without any apparent encouragement from the Turkish government , for a series of meetings aimed at uniting opposition to Assad . \nAny move by Turkish officials to engage the Syrian opposition would further alienate Damascus from Ankara . \nAnd whereas Saudi Arabia withdrew its envoy to Damascus on Monday , Idiz doubted whether Turkey would want to be seen following Riyadh 's lead , lest its actions be seen through any sectarian prism . \nAssad and the ruling clique in the Ba'athist Party hail from Syria 's minority Alawite community , a sect close to Iran 's dominant Shi'ites , while the majority of Syrians are Sunni . \nMostly Sunni Saudi Arabia sent troops to Bahrain in March to help stifle unrest among the emirate 's Shi'ite majority . \nWhile most of Turkey 's population are also Sunni , it also has a small Alawite minority , and Erdogan 's government has steadfastly sought to avoid stirring sectarian issues . \nLast Friday , Davutoglu said it was too soon to talk about asking the Syrian ambassador to Ankara to leave . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI am sure Turkey could rustle up some goon squads to do the job for them just like they did when they headed to gaza . \nHe told us that the tanks began to leave the city . \nThis is a sign that our initiative is producing results -- Erdogan LOL !

'' \n`` Either it chooses wisdom on its own or it will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss . '' \nThe assault on Deir al-Zor , in an oil-producing province bordering Iraq , took place a week after tanks stormed the city of Hama , where residents say scores have been killed . \nThe official SANA news agency said Monday the military was winding down in Hama . \nResidents said there were still tanks in parts of the city and security forces were making arrests . \nThe Observatory said 1,500 people had been arrested in Hama 's Jarajima neighborhood and troops killed three civilians . \nLike most of Syria , Hama and Deir al-Zor are mainly-Sunni cities , and the crackdowns there resonate with Sunnis , who form the majority in the region and rule most Arab countries . \nThe Arab League called for an end to the bloodshed . \nFrance and Germany repeated calls for Assad to scrap the military campaign which rights groups say has killed at least 1,600 civilians . \nSaudi Arabia 's decision to join countries putting pressure on Assad was unlikely to deter the 45-year old president , who calls the clampdown a national duty , regional experts said . \nRelations between Sunni Saudi Arabia and a Syrian ruling elite from Assad 's minority Alawite sect have been tense since the assassination in 2005 of Rafik al-Hariri , a Western-backed Lebanese Sunni statesman who also had Saudi nationality . \nIn Cairo , the head of the most influential school of Sunni Islam , al-Azhar , described the violence as a human tragedy that had to stop . \n`` Blood only fuels the fires of revolutions , '' said Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb . \nHama is known throughout the region as the site of a crackdown by Assad 's father nearly 30 years ago against Sunni Islamists in which many thousands died . \nSyrian authorities denied that any Deir al-Zor assault had taken place . \nThe official state news agency said `` not a single tank has entered Deir al-Zor '' and reports of tanks in the city were `` the work of provocateur satellite channels . '' \nSyrian authorities say they have faced attacks since the protests erupted in March , blaming armed saboteurs for civilian deaths and accusing them of killing 500 security personnel . \nState television broadcast footage Sunday of mutilated bodies floating in the Orontes river in Hama , saying 17 police had been ambushed and killed in the central Syrian city . \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who cultivated close ties with Assad but has sharply criticised the crackdown , said Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu would visit Syria Tuesday . \n`` Our message will be decisively delivered , '' he said , drawing a rebuke from an Assad adviser , who described the Turkish statement as unbalanced . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke to Davutoglu Sunday , the State Department said , asking him to `` reinforce '' Washington 's position that Syria must immediately return its military to barracks and release prisoners . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nthey do n't have any oil ... ... ... . . \nHow about Saudi Kingdom , Howmany years are they ruling ? \n, left to Saudi young generation This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nSaudi Arabia , an absolute monarchy normally loath to criticize other Arab autocrats but now wary of giving an opening to reform elements at home , pulled its envoy late on Sunday . \nKing Abdullah , in an extraordinary statement read on Al Arabiya television , said Syria 's fierce military crackdown on nearly five months of demonstrations for more political freedoms had `` nothing to do with religion , or values , or ethics . '' \nAbdullah , who has approved billions of dollars in handouts to Saudi citizens this year in a move analysts said was aimed at buffering his monarchy from political reform pressure , issued a stern warning that Syria must be open to change . \n`` Syria should think wisely before it 's too late and issue and enact reforms , '' he said . \n`` Either it chooses wisdom on its own or it will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss . '' \n`` The action of Gulf states has served to isolate the Assad regime in the Arab world , thereby signaling a major strategic shift in the region : From tacit support of the Syrian regime 's action to outright condemnation , '' said Michael Stephens , analyst at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- based in Doha . \nWhile unlikely to lead to intervention in Syria , the Gulf comments marked the sharpest Arab criticism leveled against any Arab state since a wave of protests began rocking the Middle East in January , toppling veteran rulers in Tunisia and Egypt . \nOn Monday , Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Sabah told reporters in parliament that he would meet his counterparts across the Gulf to discuss conditions in Syria . \n`` When the number of innocent people killed exceeds 2,000 , it is something totally unacceptable , '' he said , while ruling out any military action against the fellow Arab country . \nHours later , Bahrain , which itself suppressed a protest movement in March , joined growing condemnation of Syria when Foreign Minister Sheikh Khaled al-Khalifa announced the recall of his country 's ambassador . \n`` Bahrain has summoned its ambassador for consultation and stresses the importance of prudent action , '' he posted on his Twitter account . \nApart from Libya 's civil war , Syria 's military crackdown has been the most violent outgrowth of unrest in the Arab world this year . \nOn Monday , tanks extended operations to crush protesters in Syria 's Sunni Muslim tribal heartland . \nAssad 's government says it is fighting criminals and armed extremists who have provoked violence by attacking its troops . \nSyrian rights activists and Western countries say Assad 's forces have attacked peaceful protesters . \nBut sharp words against Syria by Gulf states are unlikely at this time to be followed by any decisive action . \nAnalysts expect Gulf governments to stop short of supporting intervention in Syria as they did against distant Libya , where the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have sent planes to back NATO air strikes . \nIn ruling out military action , Kuwait echoed an Arab League statement earlier on Monday saying that the pan-Arab body would use persuasion rather than `` drastic measures '' to press for an end to Syria 's bloodshed . \nDespite a lack of appetite for military moves , Saudi Arabia has played a `` game changer '' role in bringing Gulf states to heap pressure on another discredited Arab leader to quit , Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh , RUSI 's Stephens said . \nQatar , which has sought to lead Arab diplomacy as the unrest spreads , was the first to recall its envoy to Syria in July . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPositive change for everyone concerned . \nPresident Bashar al-Assad should come to a negotiating table and work out a peaceful resolution to this very unnecessary This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

We do not want nuclear plants . '' \nBerlusconi said on Monday , before the referendum result was announced , `` We must probably say goodbye to the possibility of nuclear power stations and we must strongly commit ourselves to renewable energy '' . \nShares of Italian renewable energy companies rose after his comments , made at a news conference . \nItaly , which imports nuclear-generated power from France , gets more than 50 percent of its electricity from gas , most of which is imported . \nThe nuclear vote was one of four successful referendums that are a further setback to Berlusconi , already severely weakened by local elections in May , when centre-right candidates suffered humiliating defeats , including in his powerbase of Milan . \nAnalysts say his second political miscalculation in a few weeks -- he urged Italians not to vote in the referendums -- would increase pressure on his coalition partners the Northern League to pull out the rug from under Berlusconi 's government before scheduled elections in 2013 . \nThe other referendums were on water privatisation and trial immunity for government ministers -- the latter condemned by Berlusconi 's opponents as part of a strategy to get him off the hook in four concurrent trials for fraud , corruption and paying for sex with a teenage nightclub dancer . \n"}

He does n't need to set up a committee to abolish Article Eight of the constitution , which says the Baath Party is the leader of state and society . \nThis could be done right away by presidential decree to show good will , '' Ribal said . \nIf Assad can not make reforms , he should admit he is hostage to vested interests and side with the uprising , Ribal said . \n`` What Bashar has to know is that at the end of the day he will be blamed for everything because he 's the head of the government , the army , the Baath party , '' he added . \n`` If he ca n't stand up to those people , he has to come out and say ` I 've tried to do reforms since I came to power , but the people around me have not let me . \nI need you to help me . \nI 'm stepping down and taking the side of the people ' .

Morgan and Barclays . \nSilbert said one of the reasons behind the success was his team of experienced traders . \nIt helps having leaders with long histories in the markets in which they operate , all of whom are veterans of volatility caused by extreme events . \nFive to 10 ten years does not make a veteran . \nSilbert said efforts by governments to impose greater regulatory oversight on the commodities trading business would lead to greater transparency but was unlikely to have a very large impact on the dynamics of trading . \nRisk taking in commodities may fall , but not because of regulations but because many have not deployed risk successfully as of late . \nRepublication or redistribution of Reuters content , including by caching , framing , or similar means , is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Reuters . \nReuters and the Reuters sphere logo are registered trademarks and trademarks of the Reuters group of companies around the world . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nObama 's plan will bring home the entire `` surge '' force that he sent to Afghanistan in 2010 . \nAlthough the war is unpopular among American voters , military advisers have said a rapid departure from Afghanistan is not a good idea because they fear it could allow Taliban insurgents to quickly regain lost territory . \nU.S. and NATO forces , with Britain and Germany supplying the next largest contingents , have been unable to deal a decisive blow to the Taliban , which was ousted from power in Afghanistan in 2001 . \nBritain has the second-biggest foreign troop contingent in Afghanistan with around 9,500 troops . \nMost of them are in the southern Helmand province , one of the most violent areas , and 374 have died in the decade-long war . \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said Thursday he would follow Washington in starting a gradual withdrawal of France 's 4,000 troops in the U.S. - and NATO-led operation . \nBut in London , Cameron 's spokesman said only that Britain would study the U.S. proposal . \nHe would not reveal if Britain would follow its lead and announce a detailed drawdown timetable . \n`` We will consider the U.S. announcement . \nThe national security council will consider that . \nWe will probably have more to say about that in due course , '' the prime minister 's spokesman told reporters . \nCameron said last year British troops could start leaving Afghanistan in five years , with 1,000 trainers to stay on . \nBritain plans to make a `` conditions based '' withdrawal and expects its combat troops out of Afghanistan by 2015 . \nThe spokesman said the term `` conditions based '' would not allow wiggle room for an extended stay . \n`` Conditions based , we are talking about the rate at which it proves possible to transition security to the Afghan security forces ...

'' \nIt has also said it would `` respect the will of the people , '' suggesting it would accept a referendum endorsing a `` two-state '' deal with Israel . \n\\* Due to its refusal to renounce violence and recognize Israel , many Western powers view the group as a terrorist organization . \nHamas launched waves of suicide bombings against Israelis in the 1990s and during the second Intifada , which erupted in 2000 . \n\\* Hamas is part of a regional alliance comprising Iran , Syria and the Shi'ite Islamist group Hezbollah in Lebanon , which all broadly oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East . \nIts main leader , Khaled Meshaal , lives in Damascus . \n\\* Hamas rule in Gaza survived an Israeli military offensive in 2008-2009 , triggered by rocket attacks into Israel . \nAbout 1,400 Palestinians , including hundreds of civilians , and 13 Israelis died in the conflict . \nAnalysts say support for Hamas in Gaza has shrunk after years of blockade and isolation . \n-LRB- Compiled by Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Mohammed Assadi ; editing by Crispian Balmer\\/David Stamp -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

from instability in its powerful neighbor Syria , where President Bashar al-Assad is staging a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters . \nThe domestic political crisis and the spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria are damaging the Lebanese economy , expected to grow only 2.5 percent this year , down from 7.5 percent in 2010 , according to the International Monetary Fund . \nAny conflict in Sunni-majority Syria , where Assad 's minority Alawites have long held a disproportionate share of power , could fuel political and sectarian tensions in Lebanon , as well as disrupting trade , tourism and capital inflows . \nAlso hanging over Lebanon are possible indictments by a U.N.-backed special tribunal of Hezbollah members in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri . \nHere are some of the key risks to watch : A political alliance dominated by Hezbollah , an armed Shi'ite Islamist movement backed by Syria and Iran , toppled the previous government led by Saad al-Hariri over his refusal to cut links with the tribunal seeking to try his father 's killers . \nNajib Mikati , a Sunni , was designated prime minister on Jan. 25 . \nBut disputes over cabinet posts involving Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies , as well as President Michel Suleiman , have blocked his efforts to form a government . \nOne of the knottiest problems pits Suleiman against Michel Aoun , leader of the biggest Christian bloc in parliament , who wants to name the next interior minister as part of his share of cabinet posts . \nSuleiman insists on keeping his nominee , Ziad Baroud , in the job , whose mandate includes organising elections . \nMikati has yet to disclose how he would deal with the Hariri tribunal , which is now revising secret indictments issued in January . \nIt is not clear when they will be made public . \nHezbollah , which denies any role in Hariri 's killing , wants the next government to withdraw funding and Lebanese judges from the `` politically motivated '' court based in The Hague . \nEnjoying Saudi and U.S. support , Saad al-Hariri , the main political voice of Lebanon 's Sunni community , has become more outspoken in support of the tribunal since his government fell . \nIsrael , which fought a 34-day war with Hezbollah in 2006 , has said it will target all of Lebanon in any new conflict because of the Shi'ite group 's growing clout in government . \nThe upheaval across the Arab world has shoved Lebanon 's problems out of the limelight . \nNo foreign mediators have stepped in since joint Saudi-Syrian mediation collapsed late last year . \n\\* Publication of indictments by special tribunal Lebanon 's stability has long depended on Syria , which wields influence via Hezbollah and other local allies , even though it was forced to end a 29-year military presence in 2005 . \nThe challenge to Assad family rule in Damascus is another complicating factor in Lebanon 's already intricate politics . \nIt may energise anti-Syrian Lebanese factions , or spur Hezbollah to tighten its own grip if it feels its Syrian ally is weakening . \nSyria could easily stir strife in Lebanon , still recovering from its 1975-90 civil war , if it wanted to . \nIt blames the unrest in Syria on Islamist groups and has accused pro-Hariri politicians of inciting and arming anti-Assad protesters . \nTurmoil in Syria is already spilling over the border . \nSome Syrian dissidents , including a prominent blogger , are now in Lebanon . \nHundreds of Syrians fled into northern Lebanon on April 28 after gunfire erupted on the Syrian side of the border . \nThe instability in Syria , Lebanon 's only overland outlet , has also disrupted transport and trade . \nThe prolonged political uncertainty in Lebanon , now coupled with turmoil in Syria and elsewhere , is taking its toll on an economy badly in need of reform and infrastructure investment . \nApart from lower growth , the IMF report also forecast that inflation would rise to 6.5 percent from 4.5 percent in 2010 and that the fiscal deficit would widen to 10.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- from 7.2 percent last year . \nThe Central Bank has ample foreign reserves of $ 31 billion to help keep the Lebanese pound LBP = stable . \nBut after three years of impressive GDP growth , warning signs are flashing . \nCaretaker Finance Minister Raya al-Hassan said on April 28 that activity in all sectors , including tourism , real estate and retail , was down . \nA capital outflow of about 1 percent of bank deposits had occurred in January , when political tension spiked . \nMany depositors have switched into dollars , despite higher interest rates offered on the Lebanese pound , prompting banks to conserve their local currency holdings , rather than buying the treasury bills on which government financing relies . \nLebanon 's public debt is expected to rise to $ 55 billion in 2011 from $ 51 billion in 2010 . \nAnalysts say it could hit $ 65 billion in the next three to five years unless the government cuts spending and boosts revenues to cut the fiscal deficit . \nBut even if a proper government was in place , higher food and fuel prices have increased public discontent , making it harder to implement any austerity measures . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic

'' \n`` Of course , it does not mark the end of the threat we face from extremist terror . \nIndeed , we will have to be particularly vigilant in the weeks ahead . \nBut it is , I believe , a massive step forward , '' he said . \nA government crisis committee met late on Monday to discuss bin Laden 's death . \n`` The group welcomed -LRB- President Obama 's -RRB- announcement and agreed it was an important step forward in the fight against terror , '' a spokeswoman for Cameron 's office said in a statement . \n`` They agreed to continue to make every effort to counter terrorism and extremism . '' \nThe group , known as `` Cobra , '' convenes in emergencies and brings together officials from various departments . \nSeparately , in phone calls with the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan , Cameron said Britain would work `` extremely closely '' with both countries `` to tackle the terrorist threat from Al Qaeda and from the Taliban , '' Cameron 's office said in a statement . \nForeign Secretary William Hague said he expected heightened vigilance at posts abroad for `` some time to come . '' \n`` There may be parts of al Qaeda that will try to show that they are still in business in the coming weeks as indeed some of them are , '' Hague told BBC Radio 4 , during a trip to Cairo . \nThe Foreign Office advised Britons overseas to avoid large crowds and public events , and Defense Secretary Liam Fox said he had directed his department to `` maintain a high level of vigilance in all UK defense facilities at home and abroad . '' \nBritain remains at its second-highest threat level of severe , meaning a militant attack is considered highly likely . \nCameron said bin Laden , who was killed on Monday in a firefight with U.S. forces in Pakistan , had been responsible for ordering the death of many British citizens both at home and in other parts of the world . \nIn July 2005 , four young British Islamists inspired by al Qaeda killed 52 commuters in suicide bomb attacks on the capital 's transport network . \nSixty-six Britons died in the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , on New York and Washington . \n`` Above all today we should think of the victims of the poisonous extremism that this man has been responsible for , '' Cameron said . \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair , in power at the time of the 2005 and September 11 attacks , said in a statement : `` The operation shows those who commit acts of terror against the innocent will be brought to justice , however long it takes . '' \nObama phoned Cameron early on Monday , a Downing Street spokeswoman said . \nBin Laden was killed in a compound in Abbottabad , north of Islamabad , despite the general assumption that he had been in the mountainous region between Afghanistan and Pakistan . \nFox said it was important Pakistan was fully committed to the battle against international terrorism and he hoped the killing would see a renewed commitment because `` the threat from al Qaeda will not go away with the death of one man . '' \n`` In Pakistan , it is essential that they have a battle against both the Pakistan Taliban and the Afghan Taliban , it is not sufficient to choose just one or the other . '' \nHague said Britain 's work in Afghanistan , where it has 9,500 troops , would remain `` phenomenally difficult and must go on . '' \n"}

'' \nHarper quickly became frustrated and returned to Alberta , where he urged that the province erect a firewall to prevent interference from the federal government . \nIn 1997 , he said Canada was a `` welfare state in the worst sense of the term . '' \nYet he was soon back on the national stage , winning the leadership of the Canadian Alliance -- the successor to Reform -- in 2002 and then pushing through a merger with the Progressive Conservatives to form the new Conservative Party . \nLargely thanks to that merger , the Conservatives took power in 2006 , when the forces on the centre-left were divided . \nHarper is married with two young children and is writing a book about ice hockey , Canada 's passion and its national winter sport . \nHis wife Laureen , once an eager motorcycle rider , generally keeps a low profile . \n-LRB- With additional reporting by Randall Palmer ; editing by Will Dunham -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council veto power and its role as Sudan 's top trade partner . \nWestern powers may be less inclined to look the other way over the ICC arrest warrant , but analysts say the United States , also not party to the Rome Statute , and other countries have eased pressure in hopes the secession will go peacefully . \n`` China is not a member of the ICC and has no legal obligation to implement an ICC decision , '' envoy Liu said . \n-LRB- This story corrects June 23 story to include missed word in headline -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nMore than 5,000 Syrian refugees have crossed the border and a U.N. refugee spokesman said the Red Crescent was preparing a fourth camp with room for 2,500 more . \nWitnesses said some 10,000 Syrians were sheltering near the border . \nThe assault on Jisr al-Shughour , on a key road junction , is the latest action by armed forces to crush demands for political freedom and an end to oppression that pose an unprecedented challenge to President Bashar al-Assad 's 11-year rule . \nThe main Syrian activist group organising protests said the crackdown had killed 1,300 civilians since February . \nRights groups had previously put the toll at around 1,100 . \nResidents said most of Jisr al-Shughour 's 50,000 people had fled toward the Turkish border about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- away , and tanks and helicopters had been shelling and machine-gunning the town . \nSyria has banned most foreign correspondents , making it difficult to verify accounts of events . \nIt says the protests are part of a violent conspiracy backed by foreign powers to sow sectarian strife . \n`` Units of the Syrian Arab Army have taken total control of Jisr al-Shughour and are chasing remnants of the armed terrorist gangs in the woods and mountains , '' the Syrian news agency said . \nIt said one soldier and two armed men had been killed in clashes around the town , and that that army units had defused explosives planted on bridges and roads . \nThe agency said the forces had uncovered mass graves containing the bodies of 10 security men killed and buried by armed groups in Jisr al-Shughour . \n`` Most of them had had their heads and arms amputated with machetes , '' it said . \nAsked if there were clashes in the town , Mustapha , a 39-year-old mason who said he had fled to near the Turkish border early on Sunday , told Reuters by phone : `` What clashes ? \nThe army is shelling the town from tanks . \nEveryone has been fleeing . \n`` Even if we did have guns , what are they going to do in front of artillery ? \nSyria is a tightly controlled dictatorship and all of a sudden the regime says Jisr al-Shughour is armed to the teeth . \nThey are punishing us for wanting freedom . '' \nThe government said last week that `` armed gangs '' had killed more than 120 security personnel in the town after large demonstrations there . \nRefugees and rights groups said the dead were civilians killed by security forces or soldiers who had been shot for refusing to fire on civilians . \n`` When the massacre happened in Jisr al-Shughour the army split , or they started fighting each other and blamed it on us , '' a woman refugee , who refused to give her name , told the Turkish news channel NTV on Saturday . \nA senior Western diplomat in Damascus told Reuters : `` The official version is improbable . \nMost people had left Jisr al-Shughour after seeing the regime 's scorched-earth policy , shelling and the heavy use of armor in the valley ... `` The refugee exodus into Turkey is continuing and the numbers are higher than those officially counted so far . '' \nResidents said the army unit attacking Jisr al-Shughour was commanded by Assad 's brother Maher and employing the tactics used in other centres to crush protests . \nThe United States accused the Syrian government of creating a `` humanitarian crisis '' and urged it to halt its offensive and allow immediate access by the International Committee for the Red Cross to help refugees , detainees and the wounded . \nTurkey has provided camps for refugees and sent the wounded to hospitals , but restricted access to the refugees , saying this is to protect their privacy . \nIn footage shot for Reuters by a Turkish youth on the Syrian side of the border , a few kilometres into Syria from Guvecci , exhausted and distressed looking Syrians waited in a cluster of tents and under makeshift shelters . \nThe West and the United Nations have criticised Syria for not allowing international access to the wounded , the imprisoned and the refugees , but Russia and China have not backed any Security Council action to rein in Syria 's rulers . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIn its brutal response , the regime appears to be equally as desperate . \nThis at a time when the U.N. and NATO are stretched to the limit and Russia and China are unwilling to act . \nIt will become uglier and uglier . \nI am sure -LRB- ha . \nha -RRB- that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Sarkozsy are up at this time after a sleepless night worrying about civilian deaths in Libya , reading the news on Reuters and wondering if they are in any way responsible for the Syrian mess . \nBut of course they are not responsible , and I am sure that they are both appalled at the unfolding of events and regret that there is nothing that they can do about the situation . \nThe massive propaganda effort that was launched to justify the intervention in Libya will have to be doubled now and the double-speak has to be ramped up , just to keep their little heads above water . \nBut their heads will roll -LRB- politically speaking -RRB- , because their people are now going to realize that when you debase a noble ideal -LRB- saving innocent lives -RRB- by hypocritically using it to justify military action to promote narrow self-interests , then you create a situation where no one will care when that noble ideal is invoked again by you or anybody else . \nMorality in politics does matter . \nThe Syrian President and both Cameron and Sarkozsy will soon learn that lesson . \nThey will also learn that we are now living in the 21st . \ncentury and not the 19th . \nThis whole uprising thing is ridiculous . \nFirst off , peaceful demonstrations should focus on labor stikes , shutdowns or sitins to get message out , not guns . \nGovernment should allow approved and controlled demonstrations and only use water cannons , tear gas or stun grenades if necessary to disperse unruly demonstrators . \nThe idea is to PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE . \nUnfortuately , both sides need to get a grip -LRB- on reality and move towards negotiations that lead to reform . \nIt would seem since the USA\\/Israel has been activity trying to destabilize Syria for decades with regime change & transfer of Golan Heights officially to Israel as their goal that any reports from so called human rights activists should be suspicious unless funding NGO identified & confirmed by international recognizes independent journalist . \nUnrest in Syria is regional with the majority of the nation carrying on normal daily activity and supporting the Assad government . \nThis is unlike the national popular protests of other Arab nation , and actually appears to have more in common with Ukraine s Orange Revolution 2004 than Arab Spring . \nIn the Orange revolution activist incited young university student in Kiev to protest elections the local unrest gain western media attention which to the surprise of the rest of the country lead to regime change , which was revoked by the people in the next general election . \nWe really need to question all reports of brutality that are n't validated by respected independent reporters least they lead to false accusation as those aired by the BBC against Gaddafi indicating the ordering of mass rape & issuing the troops Viagra to assist in the act . \nStories like that are meant to build popular support for continued bombardment leading to the invasion & occupation of Libya . \nAfter USA\\/EU once again going beyond the scope of UN Security Council Resolution ; using air attacks to aid rebels & impose regime change by any means , while refusing to sanction crimes against humanity of Israel , Bahrain , Yemen & Saudi Arabia it is unlikely that the USA , Israel & France will ever get Russia & China & a majority of the Security Council to approve any action against Syria or Iran . \nWe are now actively attacking 5 sovereign nations therefore we are currently at war with 6 nations -LRB- N. Korea is only a cease fire so technically the USA is still at war -RRB- . \nNo wonder we have a budget deficit . \nIt is not because of the social safety net spending but for bombs & troops to be used against nations who refuse to implement USA economic or political policy . \nBasically with the help of a willing press our government is making up lies , misrepresenting facts & instigating unrest to convince USA population of government brutality & human rights violation requiring USA interference . \nThis is not new we fell for it with Iraq , Vietnam , Pakistan & Afghanistan and the media was a willing partner . \nWhy should we accept their word concerning other proposed interventions ? \nInstead of continuing to play policemen of the world so the privileged & corporations can profit we need to revise requirements for military intervention . \nDo any of the nations we are current at war with pose a threat to USA mainland ? \nNo !!!! That should be the only reason to attack any sovereign nation . \nThere are international organization to apprehend criminals , if someone has broke the law a warrant should issued , laws should be followed . \nNo more assassination squads to eliminate people without due process under any circumstance , we are suppose to be a civilized nation ruled by law not vigilantes ! \nIs it the responsibility of the USA taxpayers to fund the acquisition , expansion & security of USA corporate foreign assets , or to maintain Israel 's illegal border expansion from its illegal 1967 attack , invasion & occupation of its nieghbors ? \nIf Bahrain & Saudi Arabia can use its security forces to impose order & put down rebellion by slaughtering peaceful protestors , destroy Mosques , & torture political detainees why ca n't Syria put down what appears to be an instigated rebellion bent only on regime change not betterment of conditions . \nThe Syrian rebels were never peaceful & continually have refused attempt by the government to respond to their complaints . \nThis speaks of a foreign backed assault to overthrow a popular government , rather than a popular protest movement to improve condition & end corruption . \nUntil the recent unrest the Syrian government has never been accused of being an brutal authoritarian dictatorship so what has change ? \nArab spring has allowed covert activist to increase their activities to incite unrest hiding under the guise of regional unrest . \nRegime change definitely benefits Israel once Assad is removed the handpicked purchased new government will finally sign the treaty transferring the Golan Heights to Israel . \nTemporarily , providing for Israel s security , until the Syrians once again take up arms against colonial occupation . . \nWhen are we going to stop the use of our taxes & military to fill the pockets of the privileged while our nation crumbles around us and the people join those of the middle east in poverty ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "58", "time": "2011-06-12", "text": "ANKARA | Sun Jun 12 , 2011 3:12 pm EDT ANKARA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey has put huge effort into improving ties with its neighbors in the Middle East but the unrest in Syria may force a rethinking of its foreign policy now that Sunday 's election is out of the way . \nTurkey 's `` zero problems with neighbors '' policy has made Ankara into a regional power and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan a hero in the Arab street . \nBut with more than 5,000 Syrian refugees fleeing across the border to escape a crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad , the long-time NATO member and European Union-candidate is reminded of the awkward position it has put itself in trying to champion democracy while befriending the region 's autocratic leaders . \nErdogan , who won a third consecutive term in Sunday 's election , has stepped up his criticism of Assad after having embraced him in recent years . \n`` The whole policy of warming up to Syria has collapsed , '' said Semih Idiz , a foreign policy expert for Milliyet daily . \n`` After the elections I expect Turkey to reevaluate its Middle East policy . \nIt has not brought the results expected . '' \nOther `` Arab Spring '' uprisings have tested Turkey 's ability to look after its new interests , but Syria -- an Iranian ally with a volatile ethnic and religious mix lying in a web of regional conflicts -- poses particular challenges . \nWhile Turkey has urged Assad to implement reforms and has added its voice to growing international condemnation by calling the crackdown `` inhumane , savage repression , '' Iran has supported the Syrian regime . \nAnkara and Tehran , which have also forged closer ties in recent years , compete for influence in Damascus . \n`` The Syrian crisis has the potential to make ties between Ankara and Tehran frostier . \nIf Iran or -LRB- Lebanon 's Shi'ite group -RRB- Hezbollah get involved in Syrian affairs Turkey will have to tell foreign powers to stay out , '' Idiz said . \nMeanwhile the Syrians seeking refuge in Turkey are delighted by the decision to keep the country 's doors open to them -- around 300 Syrians in the border area cheered and shouted `` Long live Erdogan '' on hearing of his election win on Sunday . \nSome analysts say Turkey has been turning away from the West under Erdogan over the past decade . \nLast year , 22 percent of Turkey 's exports went to the Middle East and North Africa , double the share in 2004 . \nWhile Turkey 's bid for membership of the European Union has dragged on since formal negotiations began in 2005 , Ankara has pursued free-trade accords with Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Iraq . \nIn Libya , where Turkey had ventures worth $ 15.3 billion before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi began in February , Turkish firms were forced to leave projects unfinished . \nTurkey has held joint military exercises and joint cabinet meetings with Syria and has abolished visa requirements , but those agreements might now be scaled down . \nErdogan , whose country quietly hosted a conference of Syrian opposition figures last week , has said that after Sunday 's vote Ankara would talk to Assad in a `` very different manner . '' \nHugh Pope , an analyst at International Crisis Group , said events in Syria have shown the limits of Turkey 's policy and exposed the reality that Ankara has little leverage convincing Assad to change . \n`` Turkey is terribly frustrated at Assad , but I do n't think any country has any leverage in Syria at this point . \nThe regime is in a survival mode , '' Pope said . \nHowever , he said Turkey 's close business and people 's ties might give it some leverage in the future . \nThe wars in neighboring Iraq brought refugees and severely disrupted trade with Turkey , but now Turkish firms are busy doing brisk businesses in Iraq . \n`` Whatever happens in Syria Turkey will adapt . '' \nTurkey was caught off guard at the time of the 1991 Gulf War , when 500,000 people flooded across the border from northern Iraq , but this time has started early preparing for a possible mass influx of Syrian refugees . \nWhen the 2003 invasion of Iraq was being planned , Turks made arrangements to set up a buffer zone inside Iraq to look after any refugees on Iraqi soil . \nIn the event , only around 10,000 came . \nSome media have reported that Turkish political and military officials are considering a similar zone in the Syria case if the number of refugees increases sharply , but officials have told Reuters they are not aware of such plans . \nWhen asked about the possibility , Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters : `` It 's not on the agenda right now . '' \nDamascus would not welcome the prospect of Turkish boots on Syrian soil . \nTurkey and Syria went to the brink of war in 1998 when Ankara exerted pressure on Damascus to expel Kurdistan Workers Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan who was sheltered there . \nThe expulsion and capture of Ocalan resolved the crisis . \n"}
{"id": "57", "time": "2011-09-09", "text": "President Barack Obama addresses a joint session of the United States Congress on the subject of job creation on Capitol Hill in Washington , September 8 , 2011 . \nWASHINGTON | Fri Sep 9 , 2011 9:48 am BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama 's jobs package could lift U.S. economic growth by one to three percentage points in 2012 , add well over one million jobs and lower the unemployment rate by at least half a percentage point , judging by early estimates . \nIt might not exactly deliver the `` jolt '' Obama claimed in his speech to Congress Thursday night , but it would be enough to make a difference . \nThe basic idea is to give a sufficient boost to get the stalled recovery over the hump where households , banks and businesses have paid down more of their debt loads and regained the confidence to start spending , lending and hiring again . \nOnce demand picks up , the private sector will kick in and begin hiring , and the fiscal props can fall away . \nIt would deliver the economic medicine prescribed in recent weeks by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the International Monetary Fund to prevent a worrisome slowdown in global economic growth from turning into recession . \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also can assure his fellow finance officials at the G7 meeting of top industrial nations in Marseilles on Friday the United States is pulling its weight . \nThe wild card of course is whether a Republican-dominated U.S. House of Representatives will agree to the full $ 447 billion -LRB- 280 billion pounds -RRB- package , an unlikely prospect given their criticism that the $ 830 billion stimulus program of February 2009 failed to deliver lift-off for the U.S. economy and added to the huge U.S. budget deficit . \nThe U.S. economy is so scarred by the 2007 housing credit implosion , the bank failures it triggered in 2008 and the deepest recession in 70 years that it is taking a very long time to recover and create jobs . \n`` What you come down to is that there is no silver bullet , no magic bullet that this president or anyone can propose that would drive unemployment down to 5 percent in the next year , '' said Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , an economic modeling firm in St. Louis . \n`` It has to come from the private sector and for that you have to work through the overhang from the housing crisis that is suppressing aggregate demand , '' he said . \nThis suggests that Obama 's jobs program most likely would serve as a palliative , not a cure , leaving room for the Federal Reserve to provide further monetary stimulus to keep the economy from slipping back into recession . \nAnalysts at Capital Economics estimated that Obama 's plan is equivalent to 3 percent of U.S. GDP and should be enough to add significantly to 2012 growth if passed in full by Congress . \nThe biggest single boost could come from a $ 250 billion reduction in payroll taxes . \nObama proposes extending an existing 2 percent cut in the payroll tax and increasing its size to 3.1 percent for workers , and adding a cut for employers . \n`` These payroll tax reductions are the proposals that have the greatest chance of getting passed by Congress because it will be harder for Republicans to vote against proposed tax cuts , '' said Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics . \nThe tax cuts could add as much as $ 375 billion to economic output to the $ 14 trillion U.S. economy , based upon Congressional Budget Office estimates in August of the economic impact that fiscal stimulus programs can have on GDP . \nBut not all of that would be fresh stimulus money , since a $ 112 billion payroll tax cut is already in place and would simply be extended . \nAdditionally , the full impact would be lessened because it does not target lower income workers . \n`` It gives money disproportionately to people at the top of the income scale . \nHigher income individuals are more likely to save the money , they do n't need to spend it on essentials , so the effective impact is lessened , '' said Roberton Williams , senior fellow at the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center . \nStill Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that the 2 percent payroll tax cut extension alone would add 400,000 jobs and boost GDP in 2012 by 0.5 percent . \nThe larger sum might increase that to roughly 0.7 percent GDP and 600,000 jobs . \nThe second biggest element in Obama 's plan is the $ 105 billion in infrastructure investment , which could add as much as $ 262 billion to the economy , based on the CBO figures . \nMacroeconomic Advisers estimates that could create about 150,000 new jobs in the first year and add over half a million jobs over three years -- good news but small for an economy that usually generates over two million jobs a year when in good health . \nThe challenge also would be to find `` shovel-ready '' projects where highways , railroads or school renovation plans are on the drawing board awaiting funding . \nOtherwise it can take years to get major construction projects under way . \nExtending unemployment benefits , which total $ 49 billion in Obama 's plan , also has a significant impact . \nIt could add up to $ 102 billion to the economy . \nMacroeconomic Advisers estimates it would add 0.25 percent to GDP growth in 2012 and create 200,000 new jobs by putting extra cash in consumers ' pockets . \nEconomists were re-running computer models late on Thursday to update their figures . \nBased on a smaller $ 300 billion stimulus package that Obama unveiled , Ian Shepherdson , U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics , had estimated a 1.3 percent boost to GDP and 1.7 million jobs over the life of the programs . \nTheir initial reaction was if it were adopted in full , which is quite unlikely , the plan would lower the 9.1 percent unemployment rate closer to 8 percent in 2012 and give a welcome boost to an economy that grew at a 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter . \nBut it is does not guarantee solid recovery . \n`` Is this going to be more than a panacea for our problems ? \nIt is hard to tell , '' said Williams . \n`` This downturn has been deeper and longer than anything we have seen since the 1930s and we do n't fully understand it . \nWhat we do know is that what we did in 2009 was not big enough .

'' \nAssad has responded to the protests , inspired by Arab popular uprisings that have toppled three autocratic leaders in North Africa this year , with military assaults in which the United Nations says 2,200 people have died . \nA Syrian grassroots organization said security forces have killed 3,000 civilians . \nThe killings on Friday occurred in the city of Homs , 165-km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , in the tribal province of Deir al-Zor and in the northwestern province of Idlib near Turkey -- regions that have seen raids in the last several weeks by tank-backed troops and militiamen loyal to Assad . \nThe death toll was lower than many previous Fridays . \n`` It seems that the regime eased its assaults a bit today after hearing the words of Turkey and to look better ahead of the Arab League visit , '' said one activist in the city of Hama , which saw some of the heaviest military assaults . \n`` But this is for public consumption . \nWe have been seeing a spike in the assassinations of street leaders , arrests , torture and deaths in prison , '' said the activist , who did not want to be named for fear of being apprehended . \nSyrian authorities do not comment on arrests or suspected torture but have said in the past that any arrests are made in accordance with the constitution . \nThe Arab League said that its secretary-general , Nabil Elaraby , will visit Syria on Saturday and Arab foreign ministers will meet next week to convey concerns . \nArab states led by Saudi Arabia have called on Assad to halt the violence . \nSyria 's powerful neighbor Turkey indicated that its patience was running thin given the lack of progress in its efforts to convince Assad to halt military assaults . \n`` Mr Assad , how can you say you are killing terrorists when you were actually shelling Latakia from the sea and hitting civilian targets ? '' \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on al-Jazeera Television in an interview broadcast on Thursday . \n`` We are moving patiently now . \nBut after consultations , we will give our final word , which will show an exit from the tunnel , because we are not the ones who put Assad on this dead-end road . \nIt was he and those around him who entered this dead-end road . '' \nWestern countries have imposed limited economic sanctions on Syria but have not seriously considered direct intervention along the lines of the NATO bombing of Libya that helped topple its leader Muammar Gaddafi . \n`` The Syrian people demand international protection for civilians , '' read a banner in Idlib . \nOn Thursday the Syrian opposition issued its first direct call for foreign intervention . \nThe Syrian Revolution General Commission , an umbrella bloc of activists , appealed to world powers to send human rights monitors . \nSyrian forces arrested dozens of people in house-to-house raids in Homs on Thursday after military operations that killed at least 27 civilians on Wednesday . \nActivists and residents also reported more defections among the rank-and-file army . \nHuman Rights Watch said security forces `` forcibly removed 18 wounded people '' from a hospital in Homs on Wednesday , and also prevented medical personnel from reaching wounded people . \nThe European Union , which banned imports of Syrian crude oil last week , moved closer on Friday to banning investment in the oil industry , EU diplomats said . \nSyria is only a small oil producer but nearly all of its exports last year were bought by Europe and European oil firms have investments there . \nHowever , there has been no hint in the West of an appetite for military action along Libyan lines . \nSyria has three times Libya 's population , and unlike isolated Libya it is intricately linked to neighbors on the fault lines of Mid-East conflicts . \nSyria has long had a strong regional alliance with Iran , but in an unusual sign of unease Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged Assad to open talks with the opposition , saying a military crackdown is `` never the right solution . '' \nIran crushed its own anti-government street protests in 2009 after Ahmadinejad 's contested re-election . \nThe Syrian military launched offensives against the cities of Latakia , Aleppo and Deir al-Zor last month . \nThe authorities say they are fighting a foreign conspiracy to divide Syria and blame `` armed terrorist groups '' for the bloodshed , and for killing 500 members of the army and police . \nIn Idlib province near the border with Turkey , at least three army defectors were killed by the military as it raided the Jabal al-Zawiya area in pursuit of deserters . \nActivists reported a similar operation in Qusair near the Lebanese border against defectors on Friday . \nAssad , the ruling hierarchy and most of the army officer corps are from the minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . \nThe majority of Syrians , including most rank-and-file soldiers , are Sunni Muslims . \nRussia , which has blocked a U.N. measure to censure Syria , hinted that it is ready to discuss a possible U.N.

'' \nFormally known as recovery and resolution plans -LRB- RRP -RRB- , the wills - also known as `` death plans '' - detail how a bank will survive a crisis , such as which assets or businesses would be sold off to improve capital . \nThey also spell out how the bank would be wound up speedily without destabilising the broader financial system if it proves impossible to save . \nThe Independent Commission on Banking -LRB- ICB -RRB- is expected to confirm that domestic banks must `` ringfence '' deposits with a bespoke capital cushion so that accounts are still safe if a bank gets into difficulties . \nIts final recommendations due on September 12 will force a major reworking of living wills as they will effectively split lenders into a deposit taking arm separate from a unit for riskier , investment banking activities . \n`` If you take one of the large universal banks , at the moment their living wills will be predicated on them being one institution , '' said Peter Snowdon , a regulatory lawyer at Norton Rose . \n`` Once they are two institutions , they have to have two living wills . \nIt 's like a living will for suicide , '' Snowdon said . \nThe betting among lawyers is that even if the effective date of the ICB-led changes is pushed back to 2015 or later , UK regulators will pressure banks to rewrite living wills sooner rather than later to make them workable . \nMichael McKee , a financial partner at DLA Piper , said the ICB will say little about living wills but its recommendations will force banks to reorganise their structures . \n`` They will then have to modify their resolution plans to fit the new structures created , '' McKee said . \nIt wo n't be cheap , though costings are hard to come by . \n`` This amounts to a huge job : given the length of time to generate one of these things and amount of resources , there will be armies of consultants and lawyers lining up , '' said Bob Penn , a partner at Allen & Overy lawfirm . \n`` The outcome of it for a big clearing bank is going to be a document that runs into thousands or even tens of thousands of pages , '' Penn said . \nThe government spent over a trillion pounds to shore up its banking sector and buy stakes in or nationalise lenders such as Northern Rock , Royal Bank of Scotland -LRB- RBS . \nL -RRB- and Lloyds -LRB- LLOY . \nL -RRB- in the fallout from the financial crisis . \nThis galvanised the UK Financial Services Authority to pioneer living wills well ahead of a global initiative which world leaders are expected to endorse in November . \nThe FSA has already forced six banks , including Barclays -LRB- BARC . \nL -RRB- , HSBC -LRB- HSBA . \nL -RRB- , Lloyds and RBS , to submit living wills under a UK pilot program . \n`` The very important but largely unsung recovery and resolution plans , better known by the distasteful term ` living wills ' , are nearly complete in the UK banks , '' British Bankers ' Association Chief Executive Angela Knight said in a blog last month . \nThe changes that will be wrought by the ICB 's ringfencing will be of a different scale to the tweaks that could be anticipated from the pilot program , lawyers working for banks say . \n`` Using living wills to effect structural change is like operating with a scalpel while the ICB has been asked to wield an axe - cleaving banks into two without regard for the risks they pose individually , '' Penn said . \nLiving wills will also have to be updated each time a bank makes any major changes to its business model and the whole process will be time consuming for senior management . \n`` The tentacles stretch out through the whole business . \nYou ca n't get the tea lady to do it because it 's something the regulators will crawl over , '' Snowdon said . \nThe new structures created by the ICB recommendations , coupled with regulation from the European Union and global bodies to beef up bank capital and liquidity , will spark a fundamental rethink of banking business models . \n`` The ICB is part of a much broader structural debate for banks as boards ask what are we going to look like in five years ' time , '' Penn said . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

If you look at the restrictions on Iran , it has taken a number of years for those to become apparent in terms of actual production levels , '' she said . \nThe European Union buys nearly all of Syria 's exported oil and analysts have said oil companies have a vested interest in the current government , which has provided favourable operating conditions for oil firms . \nEuropean diplomats have said they are reluctant to impose full-scale sanctions on Syria to avoid increasing the suffering of the Syrian people by cutting off fuel needed for power generation . \nOil revenues are especially important for Syria as its tourism industry , which normally accounts for around 12 percent of the economy , has been hit hard by the violence . \nAn internal memorandum from an oil company , seen by Reuters , predicts that Syria may soon face insufficient supply of petroleum products which will affect heating , electricity production , domestic usage and transportation . '' \n-LRB- It -RRB- will make the winter period much harder for the public . \nThis will leave the Assad administration in a more difficult position against the public , '' it said . \n"}

Security Council resolution condemning Damascus , but the Arab League 's decision last weekend to suspend Syria has given international moves new momentum . \nOn the day the suspension came into force , the League 's foreign ministers met in the Moroccan capital with a Syrian flag next to an empty chair where the Syrian minister , who boycotted the meeting , would have sat . \nThe League -- which normally shies away from decisive action against its own members -- decided at the meeting to ask its experts to draft recommendations on economic sanctions on Syria . \nThe decision brought a plan announced at the weekend one step closer to implementation . \nAt their meeting in Rabat , the Arab foreign ministers also gave Damascus three days to implement a road map agreed this month to end the bloodshed and allow in observers , though they did not say what would happen if Syria failed to comply . \nAsked if the ultimatum was a last attempt at diplomacy , Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim al-Thani told reporters : `` We do not want to talk about a last-ditch attempt because I do not want this to sound like a warning . \n`` What I can say is that we are close to the end of the road as far as the -LRB- League 's -RRB- efforts on this front are concerned . '' \nThe Arab League has stopped short of calling for Assad 's departure or proposing any Libya-style military intervention , but its ostracism of Syria is a blow to a country whose ruling Baath party puts Arab nationalism at the center of its credo . \nIn Damascus , Assad supporters threw stones at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates , in one of the most secure districts of the city , and smeared its walls with graffiti , witnesses said . \nSpeaking earlier in Rabat , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu compared Syria with Libya , where rebels captured , humiliated and killed Muammar Gaddafi last month . \n`` The regime should meet the demands of its people , '' he said . \n`` The collective massacres in Syria and ... the bloodshed can not continue like this . '' \nTurkey has spent years courting its neighbor , but is now leading regional efforts to pit pressure on Assad . \nIn Tehran , Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi criticized the Arab League for `` acting in a way that will hurt the security of the region . '' \nHe told the official news agency IRNA that Syria , an ally of Iran since 1980 , had repeatedly pledged to meet legitimate popular demands and enact reforms . \n`` Unfortunately , some countries believe that they are outside the crisis ... but they are mistaken because if a crisis happens they will be entangled by its consequences . '' \nWestern countries have tightened sanctions on Syria and on Monday Jordan 's King Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to urge Assad to quit . \nIn the early months of the uprising , attempts by security forces to crush mainly peaceful protests accounted for most of the violence . \nBut since August there have been growing reports of army defectors and armed civilians fighting back . \nActivists said Free Syrian Army fighters fired machineguns and rockets at a large Air Force Intelligence complex on the northern edge of the capital at about 2:30 a.m. -LRB- 0030 GMT -RRB- . \nA gunfight ensued and helicopters circled over the complex , on the Damascus-Aleppo highway . \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties . \nSyrian state media did not mention the attack . \nWashington said it had few details and no confirmation of the incident , but that Assad was courting trouble . \n`` It 's not surprising that we are now seeing this kind of violence , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` We do n't condone it in any way , shape or form . \nBut let 's be very clear that it is the brutal tactics of Assad and his regime in dealing with what began as a non-violent movement -LRB- that -RRB- is now taking Syria down a very dangerous path . '' \nA Western diplomat in Damascus described the assault as `` hugely symbolic and tactically new , '' saying that if the reported details were true it would be `` much , much more coordinated than anything we have seen before . '' \n`` To actually attack a base like this is something else , and so close to Damascus as well , '' said the diplomat , adding that fighting in recent weeks involving army deserters in the town of Rastan and the city of Homs resembled a localized civil war . \n`` It 's not a nationwide civil war , but in very specific locations , it is looking like that , '' said the diplomat . \nThe Free Syrian Army was set up by deserters and is led by Colonel Riad al-Asaad , who is based in southern Turkey . \nIt announced this week that it had formed a `` temporary military council '' of nine rebel officers , led by Asaad . \nThe statement said the Free Syrian Army aimed to `` bring down the regime and protect citizens from the repression ... and prevent chaos as soon as the regime falls , '' adding that it would form a military court to try `` members of the regime who are proven to have been involved in killing operations .

{"id": "198", "time": "2011-11-18", "text": "LONDON | Fri Nov 18 , 2011 5:08 pm EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Growing Syrian army defections do not yet pose a mortal threat to President Bashar al-Assad , but outside support could turn the dissidents into a national insurgency able to harass and exhaust his military . \nAs the country apparently slides further toward civil war , analysts say Assad will seek to deny nascent armed opposition groups sufficient territory to organize a guerrilla campaign . \nHis task will be the easier if the former soldiers are unable to obtain sustained expert help from abroad in organizing their logistics and training recruits . \nIt is not yet clear if the defectors have forged such a network , either from the Syrian diaspora or foreign powers . \n`` If they get help from Turkey or certain Arab countries it could take maybe 5 , 6 or 8 months to win against the regime , '' British-based opposition activist Samer Afndi told Reuters . \n`` If no help will come , it will take a longer time , '' said Afndi , a former Syrian state security official . \nHe said morale among many in the opposition was boosted by a raid by army defectors on an airforce intelligence complex in Harasta near Damascus on Wednesday that had killed or wounded 20 policemen . \nIt was the first of its kind in an eight-month revolt against Assad 's rule by protesters inspired by uprisings which toppled the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nBut Afndi said the guerrillas , estimated by some analysts at several thousand , needed safe liberated areas in which to train and obtain logistical support . \n`` In truth , the armed insurgency is not strong enough to significantly threaten the regime at present , '' Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for risk consultancy AKE , told Reuters . \n`` However , with support from elsewhere , it may become more organized and capable of inflicting damage . '' \n`` The turning point will come when it has the ability to control ground in the face of an regime counter-offensive . '' \nThe exact strength of the dissident soldiers is not known and Syria 's ban on most foreign media makes it hard to verify events on the ground . \nColonel Riad al-As ` aad of the Free Syrian Army told Reuters in Turkey last month that 10-15 ,000 soldiers , out of the roughly 200,000-strong military , had defected all over the country and that desertions were continuing every day . \nSyria 's military is controlled by the president 's brother Maher and members of their minority Alawite sect , while the army is comprised mostly of Sunni Muslims , who also form the majority of Syria 's population . \nDiplomatically Assad looks increasingly isolated , a factor that may eventually affect the military equation on the ground . \nThe Arab League agreed on Saturday to start talks with Syrian dissidents after a majority of its 22 members voted to suspend Syria 's membership of the pan-Arab body from Wednesday over its violent response to protests . \nREGIONAL POWERS MAY GET SUCKED IN The rebellion has been met by a military crackdown that has killed more than 3,500 people , according to a U.N. count . \nSyria blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who it says have killed more than 1,100 soldiers and police . \nIn a note to clients , London 's Exclusive Analysis consultancy said the attack in Harasta had likely dealt a psychological blow to the political elite around Assad . \n`` Further attacks of this kind would likely encourage further defections in the Syrian Army , sensing that it might be on a losing side . \n`` Along with implied Turkish support for armed opposition , this suggests that the Assad government will struggle to contain protests in major cities in the 3-6 month outlook and increases the risk of a civil war beyond that timeframe . \nA Syria expert at Exclusive Analysis who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic said he expected `` a steady erosion of the power of the Syrian army and a steady limiting of the territory that it can access . '' \n`` The way it 's heading is more toward full scale civil war which draws in the intervention of regional actors .

'' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said he doubted Syria would respond positively to the Arab League initiative . \nBut he said any international intervention must not be unilateral and should be mandated by the United Nations . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton feared the country could slide into civil war . \n`` I think there could be a civil war with a very determined and well-armed and eventually well-financed opposition that is , if not directed by , certainly influenced by defectors from the army , '' she told NBC news in Indonesia , where she was attending a regional summit . \nHowever , she did not foresee the global community intervening in the same way as it did in Libya . \n`` There is no appetite for that kind of action vis-a-vis Syria , '' she said , pointing to moves by the Arab League and Turkey . \nJuppe , speaking alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmed Davutoglu , said France was ready to work with the Syrian opposition and that tougher sanctions were needed on Damascus . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague will meet Syrian opposition representatives in London next week in what officials characterized as an intensification of contact with Assad opponents . \nA Foreign Office source said Britain was `` a long way off '' from recognizing the Syrian National Council or Syrian opposition groups as a government-in-waiting or as the legitimate alternative to Assad . \n`` What they have to do is come together and form a coherent unified vision of the Syria they want of the future , particularly around the transition period and how to get there , '' the source said . \nSanctions already imposed by the European Union and the United States are starting to bite : On Friday , French oil major Total said Syria had halted payments for its oil production activities . \nSyria 's oil exports , worth $ 400 million a month , a vital source of government earnings , have come to a standstill . \nBut , at the end of a week in which army deserters attacked an intelligence building near Damascus and waged a deadly battle with Assad 's forces , Juppe appeared to call on the opposition not to use army defectors to mount attacks . \n`` We are making a call to the Syrian opposition . \nTo avoid a civil war , we hope that the army will not be mobilized . \nThis would be a catastrophe , '' Juppe said . \nHundreds of people have been killed in Syria , including civilians , army deserters and forces loyal to Assad , since it agreed on November 2 to withdraw troops from urban areas and release political prisoners under an Arab League initiative . \nSyria says it is trying to implement the deal but has called on neighboring countries to do more to stem a flow of arms to the opposition and end what it says is a media campaign of incitement against Syrian authorities . \nOn Friday activists said security forces shot dead at least 11 people and wounded dozens when they fired to disperse protests in the cities of Deraa , Homs , Hama and the Damascus suburb of Erbin . \nSyria 's state news agency said two members of the security forces were killed and a third was seriously wounded when a bomb exploded in the province of Hama . \nTwo others were wounded by gunfire in Deraa , it said . \nSyria has barred most independent journalists from the country , making it difficult to verify reports from activists or officials . \nAuthorities blame the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who they say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . \nProtesters called on foreign countries to expel Syrian ambassadors in support of the opposition . \n`` Whoever fears God should expel the Syrian ambassador '' read a banner at a demonstration in the southern province of Deraa , where the uprising erupted in March . \nIn the eastern province of Hasaka , protesters shouted , `` Why are you afraid ? \nGod is with us ! '' \nIn Homs and Hama , young men dancing arm in arm chanted `` The Free Army is our army , '' referring to army deserters who have waged an escalating campaign of attacks on state targets . \nOpposition sources said on Wednesday the Free Syrian Army had killed or wounded 20 security police in an assault on an Air Force Intelligence complex on the outskirts of Damascus , the first of its kind in the revolt against Assad . \nRussia , which opposed Western efforts to secure a Security Council resolution condemning Syria which could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , said the raid showed that the conflict in Syria was `` similar to real civil war . '' \nFrance , Britain and Germany plan to ask the U.N. General Assembly 's human rights committee to approve a resolution condemning the violence in Syria , before putting the non-binding measure to a vote in an assembly plenary session . \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called on Friday for a cautious response from the international community . \n`` We are ready to work with the international community but we call for restraint and caution , '' Putin told reporters , asked whether Russia will support calls for Assad to resign or back a U.N. resolution condemning his actions . \nMeeting his French counterpart Francois Fillon in Moscow , Putin chided France for meddling in the affairs of other nations and reiterated a warning against military intervention . \nFillon said that faced with an increasingly `` dramatic '' situation in Syria , France was `` more than ever determined to take action '' against a president `` who has lost all legitimacy in our eyes by firing on his own people . '' \nIran 's ambassador to Lebanon said growing international pressure would not topple Syria 's government . \n`` These threats will not yield any results , '' Ghadanfar Roken Abadi said on Friday . \n`` Intensifying these threats ... only increases our enthusiasm for popular unity with Syria . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nMore frequently than not the Western media campaign against the government of President Bashar Al-Assad quotes various opposition groups regarding the number of people killed and that the army killed them . \nThere is a very radical element in the opposition that will kill their fellow citizens and members of the police and army charged with protecting the citizens of Syria . \nWhy should the government of Syria give in to a small radical minority who is calling for its overthrow when the majority wants to keep the government and are willing to give it time to implement reforms ? \nThis scant radical minority is being armed , funded and egged on by extreme Islamic groups and Gulf Arabs as well as Western governments -LRB- Turkey included -RRB- , who want to see the Arab opposition to Israel and the tyrannical attitude to the Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries diluted . \nThose vehemently opposed to the Assad government -LRB- I reject calling them a `` regime '' -RRB- both in the West and Arab Gulf have never forced the opposition to meet with the government for discussions . \nInstead they have allowed opposition exile groups to meet in Turkey to plan against the Government . \nHow would the Turkish government react if Syria permitted the PKK to convene a resistance group in Syria ? \nWhat gives France the right to interfere in Syrian domestic politics and demand Assad 's ouster ? \nThey are no longer the colonial power of the land . \nIt appears to me that the West is attempting to compartmentalize the world and in the Middle East that means appointing Turkey as the overlord to return the region to Ottoman style rule . \nThis will be a tragedy for democratic principles and freedoms for Syrians . \nThis will especially affect the Christian population who has been allowed to witness freely in the country free from oppression and limit on their role in civil society . \nThe opposition can not expect to win through violence and destruction . \nWhy is not President Bashar Al Assad given a chance to institute constitutional and civil reform ? \nBahrain has committed atrocities in greater proportion to Syria but is allowed to slide because of its alliance with the West and Saudi Arabia . \nWhere is the West to be so vehement and vocal in its reaction to the situation in Yemen ? \nWhere is the West to question why free elections in Qatar will take 2-years while they expect the Syrian Government to turn things around in a matter of months ? \nWhere is the mighty , righteous and `` principled '' West to decry the repression in Saudi Arabia ? \nBecause of its relationship with Iran ? \nI am attempting to find one truth in the Post by RJNYC . \nIt is the Arab Nations that are reporting the atrocities of the Al-Assad Government , not just the West . \nAre you calling them Liars ? \nEveryday we see the Army continuing their assault on a majority-led democratic reform bloodbath on their own people . \nI sympathize with those who do not know what Freedom means and ask them to give it a chance in Syria . \nArab Nations have asked Al-Assad to put away the guns used on the population . \nHis resistance will keep him in power . \nA power oppressing the majority of Syrian citizens . \nTheir own Army is in a contradiction of right . \nNot Syria , Al-Assad 's country . \nSOOO reminiscent of Nazi Germany ! \nIt 's mind boggling that people -LRB- troops -RRB- will BLINDLY follow the orders of a despot ! \n`` Somethings rotten in Denmark '' ... ... . . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAnkara expelled the Israeli ambassador in a feud over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for the Palestinian enclave of Gaza . \nIsrael has said it would not apologise , which Turkey has demanded . \n`` Israel refused even to listen to voices of reason in the West that realized the reality of the changes in the region and called for it to apologise to Turkey to what it did to -LRB- Turkey 's -RRB- sons that it killed , '' he said . \nTurkey has also engaged with its neighbor Iran , which is embroiled in a standoff with the West over its nuclear ambitions . \nIran is also a close ally of Syria 's . \n`` I think that Turkey has a role in correcting the Iranian discourse -LRB- regarding Syria -RRB- .

'' \ncheered a group of demonstrators as the Turkish prime minister left the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo where he had been speaking . \nThey were calling for change in Syria , whose military is trying to stamp out popular unrest . \nDisplaying a populist touch , Erdogan stopped and shook the demonstrators ' hands . \nHe told an Arab League ministers meeting that international recognition of a Palestinian state was `` not an option but an obligation . '' \n`` It 's time to raise the Palestinian flag at the United Nations . \nLet 's raise the Palestinian flag and let that flag be the symbol of peace and justice in the Middle East . \nLet 's contribute to securing well deserved peace and stability in the Middle East , '' he said . \nPalestinians will bid for full membership of the United Nations later this month , a move opposed by the United States , which has a veto . \nArab states endorsed it at the Cairo meeting . \nErdogan said Turkey offered its help to Arab nations facing turmoil but , in an apparent reference to Syria , he said some had turned down the offer . \n`` However , we continue to insist they meet their people 's demands . '' \nArab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby introduced the Turkish prime minister saying : `` All the Arab peoples appreciate what you are doing . \nWe consider that there is a strong friendly state who is always standing on the side of justice . '' \nOutside the League , Syrian protester Samer Zaher , 30 , said : `` Erdogan has turned into an Arab hero ... We have not found a leader as powerful as him addressing -LRB- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -RRB- and asking him to quit . '' \nTurkey expelled the Israeli ambassador last week in a row over an Israeli raid last year that killed nine Turks on a flotilla bound for Gaza , the Palestinian enclave controlled by the Islamist group Hamas and under blockade by Israel . \nWhile winning over ordinary Arabs , particularly because of non-Arab Turkey 's tough line towards Israel , Erdogan 's growing popularity and clout could be a headache for more cautious Arab leaders who could see their own influence overshadowed . \n`` Turkey wants to play a regional role , especially when Egypt is busy with the revolution . \nTurkey thinks it 's best placed to play this leadership role , '' said Adel Soliman , head of Cairo 's International Centre for Future and Strategic Studies . \nEgypt has traditionally seen itself as the leading diplomatic player in the Arab region . \nBut its position has been eroded by wealthy Gulf countries , such as Qatar , and lately overshadowed by Turkey , with its fast expanding economy . \nErdogan met Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , who heads the military council that took over after Hosni Mubarak was ousted by mass street demonstrations in February . \nEgypt has also been embroiled in a dispute with Israel after Israel shot dead five Egyptian border guards in repelling cross-border raiders it said were Palestinian militants . \nBut Egypt 's generals have faced popular criticism for not taking a firmer line . \nCairo said it would expel Israel 's ambassador but did not follow through with threat . \nProtesters attacked Israel 's embassy in Cairo last week , prompting the ambassador to fly home and an embarrassed Egyptian government to affirm to Washington , its major aid donor , that it remained committed to a 1979 peace treaty with Israel . \nEgypt has received billions of dollars in U.S. military and other aid since making peace with the Jewish state , so the military council faces a difficult balancing act responding to public calls for an assertive policy towards Israel . \nErdogan was cheered by a crowd when he arrived in Cairo and met by Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf . \nMany appeared to be from Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood , who approve of Erdogan 's bringing Islamists into mainstream Turkish politics . \n`` Erdogan , Erdogan -- a big welcome from the Brothers !

oil refinery on Monday in an apparent attempt to disrupt a drive by Libya 's new rulers to seize the ousted leader 's last bastions and revive the oil-based economy . \nA Syrian-based television station said it would soon broadcast another message from the fugitive Gaddafi , who has issued regular battle calls to his followers in the three weeks since Tripoli was overrun . \nThe new ruling National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- says that as long as Gaddafi remains on the run he is capable of attracting followers to a dangerous insurgency . \nWitnesses to the refinery attack said the assailants damaged the front gate of the facility , 20 km -LRB- 13 miles -RRB- from the coastal town of Ras Lanuf , but not the plant itself , which is not fully operational . \nAbout 60 staff were there at the time of the attack , according to one of two wounded survivors at a hospital where the dead were also taken . \nRefinery worker Ramadan Abdel Qader , who had been shot in the foot , told Reuters that gunmen in 14 or 15 trucks had come from the direction of the Gaddafi-held coastal city of Sirte . \n`` We heard firing and shelling at around 9 in the morning from Gaddafi loyalists , '' he said . \nStaff had been asleep . \nThe assault occurred only hours after the NTC announced it had resumed some oil production , which had been all but halted since anti-Gaddafi protests turned into civil war in March . \nThe interim council is struggling to assert its control over the entire country and capture a handful of stubbornly defended pro-Gaddafi towns . \nMany senior NTC officials also see scooping up Gaddafi and the members of his family who are still on the run as crucial to finally declaring victory in the seven-month old war . \nGaddafi 's son Saadi arrived in neighbouring Niger on Sunday after crossing the remote Sahara desert frontier . \nOn Monday the U.S. State Department said that the government of Niger had confirmed to it that it intended to detain the former soccer player . \nBut a Nigerien government spokesman told Reuters that Saadi Gaddafi was only being watched for now . \n`` Nothing has changed in the government 's position . \nThere is no international search for him . \nLike the others he is just under surveillance , '' the spokesman said , referring to other Gaddadfi loyalists who have recently fled to Niger . \nTwo other sons and Gaddafi 's only biological daughter have fled to Algeria . \nOne son is reported to have died in the war and three others are still on the run . \nThe NTC has said it will send a delegation to Niger to seek the return of anyone wanted for crimes . \nNiger , like Algeria , has cited humanitarian reasons for accepting fugitives of the former government , but has promised to respect its commitments to the International Criminal Court , which wants to try Gaddafi , son Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi for war crimes . \nNTC forces , which seized Tripoli on August 23 , said they were meeting fierce resistance on the fourth day of fighting for the Gaddafi-held desert town of Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of the capital , and were edging towards Sirte . \nLibya 's economy is almost entirely dependent on oil , and restarting production is crucial to restoring the economy . \nInterim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said on Sunday some oil production had resumed , but would not say where or how much . \nLibya holds Africa 's largest crude oil reserves and sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe under Gaddafi . \nWestern oil firms , including Italy 's Eni and Austria 's OMV , are keen to restore production . \nEni 's chief executive told Reuters his priority was to restart gas exports via a pipeline from Libya to Italy by October or November . \nResuming oil output was less urgent . \n`` We are by far the biggest player in Libya , both in oil and in gas , so I came here with the idea of ` back to normal ' , '' Paolo Scaroni said during a visit to Tripoli . \nIn Bani Walid , fleeing residents reported intense street fighting while NATO warplanes could be heard overhead . \nFamilies trapped there for weeks escaped after Gaddafi forces abandoned some checkpoints on the outskirts . \nDozens of cars packed with civilians streamed out of the area . \n`` We are leaving because of the rockets . \nThey are falling near civilian homes , '' said one resident , Ali Hussain . \nThe United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside besieged pro-Gaddafi towns . \n`` Our big concern right now is Sirte , where we are receiving reports that there 's no water and no electricity , '' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in Dubai . \nThe NTC has sent extra units to Bani Walid , but some fighters said this only worsened tribal tensions between fighters from other areas and those from the town . \n`` Our fighters are from all over Libya . \nThere was little control over them yesterday . \nToday we will control them better , '' said NTC commander Mohamed el-Fassi . \nHe said five NTC fighters were killed and 14 wounded in Sunday 's clashes . \nSome NTC combatants said they suspected local fighters of the Warfalla tribe , Libya 's largest , of passing tips to Gaddafi forces in Bani Walid . \n`` We believe there are traitors among them , '' said Mohammed el Gahdi , from the coastal city of Khoms . \nNTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters the plan for Bani Walid for now was to wait . \n`` When our forces entered Bani Walid they found the brigades of Gaddafi using citizens as shields , '' he said , adding that missile launchers had been placed on the roofs of homes , making it impossible for NTC forces or NATO warplanes to strike . \n"}

'' \nSome of the hesitation in Abdel Jalil 's arrival in Tripoli after the fall of Gaddafi seemed to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli -- run by rebel brigades that swept in from towns and provinces eager for a share of power -- may not be a safe place for every official . \nThe NTC 's timetable which sets out plans for a new constitution and elections over a 20-month period , should start once the NTC declares Libya 's `` liberation .

'' \nThe shipping industry , some of whose members already employ private guards , says better armed and increasingly violent seaborne gangs pose a growing threat to vital sea lanes . \nBlount said the military was `` completely agnostic '' on private armed guards , and nations , flag states and the industry had to be clear on whether they backed using contractors . \n`` I think a ship with private security onboard will be taken successfully by pirates -- it is a matter of time , '' he said . \nThe industry last week urged the United Nations to create an armed military force to be deployed on vessels to tackle Somali piracy . \n`` The current military response -- with only a handful of navy ships available to provide protection on any given day -- has just been a sticking plaster on a gaping wound , '' said International Chamber of Shipping chairman Spyros Polemis . \n`` Governments have so far failed to protect shipping , and the smooth flow of world trade , from being literally held to ransom by Somali criminals , '' he said on Wednesday . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "240", "time": "2011-09-14", "text": "AMMAN | Wed Sep 14 , 2011 10:21 am EDT AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - From his window on the corniche of Syria 's Mediterranean port city of Tartous , an international shipper bemoans the change since a popular uprising six months ago engulfed the country and dealt a heavy blow to its economy . \n`` At night , ship lights made Tartous extend into a city on the sea ; now it 's like a small village . \nThe port 's sealine was full of vessels -- now the berths are nearly empty , '' said the shipper , who opened an agency in Tartous to cash in on a boom in traffic after the Iraq war wound down . \nStreet protests demanding the removal of Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad , many of them bloodily suppressed , have shrunk traffic at the country 's ports and damaged its hopes of capitalizing on its position as a Middle East crossroads to grab a bigger share of transit business . \nThe exact extent to Syria 's economy is being hurt by the unrest and resulting international sanctions is not clear ; official data is scarce . \nBut many analysts expect gross domestic product to decline this year , perhaps by several percent or more . \nAt the start of this year , the International Monetary Fund predicted it would grow 3 percent . \nShippers and businessmen say exports have dropped as foreign customers have cut orders , while Syrian importers have delayed orders because of the uncertainty . \nMeanwhile , companies which used Syria as a conduit to conduct trade with other countries in the region are seeking different routes . \nSyria 's principal port of Latakia , where the military deployed three months ago , has been hit hard along with Tartous . \n`` Even the Mediterranean cruise liners that came to Latakia and Tartous , and had hundreds of Italian and Spanish tourists , have not come this year , '' said the international shipper , who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . \nShipping sources say traffic in general cargoes , dry and liquid bulk cargoes , and containers at Latakia and Tartous has been slipping since the uprising broke out in March . \nThey estimate volumes shrank an average 35 to 40 percent from a year earlier in the first eight months of 2011 . \n`` Importers and exporters are being very cautious , and that has led to imports of raw materials falling sharply as production slows down in many industries due to the troubles , '' a Syrian transportation official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters from Damascus . \nShipping agents and industry experts said container volumes , the vast majority of which are handled by Latakia , dropped in June alone by 36 percent from a year earlier to 33,527 twenty-foot equivalent units -LRB- TEU -RRB- . \nOfficial Latakia port figures for the April-June period show a drop of 16 percent from a year earlier , but industry sources said this data was misleading because it included many containers with empty space . \nIn Tartous , which handles most of Syria 's bulk cargoes , or nearly 9 million tonnes of annual traffic in normal times , shipping sources said some European operators were avoiding the port after the European Union announced sanctions on Syrian oil exports at the start of September . \nThey said they were also seeing less business from Iraqi and other Arab traders who were deterred by the increasing checkpoints and roadblocks in many parts of Syria . \n`` We had 25 to 30 vessels daily arriving . \nThis has dropped to between 10 to five daily , '' said a major shipping agent based in Tartous , referring to vessels between 8,000 and 35,000 tonnes . \nSo far , major regular shipping lines such as Danish firm Maersk , French-based CMA CGM , Geneva-based MSC , and Germany 's Hamburg Sud have largely maintained normal vessel calls to Syrian ports despite lower cargo volumes , industry sources said . \nShipping agents say the companies are reluctant to pull out of a transit market that has served the whole region and still has great long-term potential because of its location . \n`` No major regular shipping lines are quitting at the moment . \nOnce they withdraw from any service , it 's very hard to restore , '' said Talal Halawani , a shipper whose Amman-based Liberty Shipping is an agent of a leading Italian line . \n`` Although they are suffering because cargo is not like before , they are still operating normally despite all the constraints . \nIt 's a wait-and-see attitude . '' \nBut other regional companies with no regular services have less ability to sustain losses , and they have omitted port calls or canceled visits to Syrian ports altogether . \n`` Liners that made container ship calls four times a month are now calling three times a month . \nSome regional liners , including one or two Turkish liners , have even dropped port calls altogether , '' said a second Syrian transportation official . \nSome shippers are seeking to offset the drop in their Syrian trade by offering more competitive rates for container slots in nearby Beirut , Mersin and Alexandria ports , which are in the same Europe-Mediterranean service . \nThe turmoil has prompted many lines to suspend plans , some drawn up only a few months ago , to add more container slots or introduce bigger vessels on Syrian port calls in anticipation of demand related to the reconstruction of Iraq . \nOver the past five years , Syrian ports were able to boost their transit trade with Iraq , Jordan and the Arabian peninsula as Syria 's red tape and state controls , a legacy of five decades of Soviet-style economic management , were reduced . \nLatakia and Tartous were also revitalised by the award of contracts to manage their container terminals to foreign investors in partnership with local investors linked to the Assad family . \nThe foreign investors -- CMA CGM in Latakia , and the Philippines ' International Container Terminal Services in Tartous -- upgraded the facilities and helped to nearly double the ports ' container traffic last year to 620,000 TEU from around 365,000 TEU in 2004 . \nNearly 40 percent of Latakia 's total incoming cargo volume has been Iraq-bound , shippers and Syrian transportation officials say , while for Tartous the figure has been as high as 70 percent . \nSyrian ports ' flexibility and lower costs gave them a competitive advantage in Iraq-related business against Turkish and Lebanese ports and Jordan 's Aqaba . \nLower land transport costs were also a plus , along with the ability to bypass Suez Canal fees paid by importers using Jordanian and Saudi ports on the Red Sea . \nNow , Iraqi , Jordanian and Saudi Arabian importers , who have used Syrian ports in recent years for bulk cargoes of wood , marble , steel and grains from the Black Sea area and North and Central Europe , are looking for alternatives . \n`` We are getting increasing inquiries from local and Iraqi traders who want to bring their goods to Jordan by sea from Turkey or other markets . \nThis business traditionally would go to Syrian ports . \nEven goods that would normally go by land via Syria are now being shipped , '' said Captain Wahid Abu Ajamieh , general manager of CMA CGM Jordan . \n`` This is an indication that something odd is happening .

The Arab League said on Sunday it had rebuffed a request by Damascus to amend plans for a 500-strong monitoring mission to Syria , after President Bashar al-Assad vowed to continue his crackdown and said he would not surrender to outside pressure . \nWithin hours of Assad ignoring a deadline to halt repression of protesters , residents said two rocket-propelled grenades hit a major ruling party building in Damascus on Sunday , the first such reported attack by insurgents inside the capital . \nConfronted since March by street demonstrations against 41 years of rule by his family , Assad said he had no choice but to pursue his crackdown on unrest because his foes were armed . \n`` The conflict will continue and the pressure to subjugate Syria will continue . \nSyria will not bow down , '' he told Britain 's Sunday Times newspaper . \nArab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby rejected Syria 's request to alter a plan for the fact-finding mission -- which would include military personnel and human rights experts -- in a letter to Syria 's foreign minister . \n`` The additions requested by the Syrian counterpart affect the heart of the protocol and fundamentally change the nature of the mission , '' said the letter , released by the Arab League . \nSyria 's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the plan as it stood compromised the country 's sovereignty but Damascus had not rejected the mission Moualem said the proposed mission has `` pervasive jurisdiction that reaches the level of ... violating Syrian sovereignty '' and said he would send the Arab League a letter with questions about its role . \n`` We will reply to the Arab League secretary general by responsibly presenting a number of queries , '' he told a televised news conference in the Syrian capital . \nThe Cairo-based League had given Damascus three days from a meeting on November 16 to abide by a deal to withdraw military forces from restive cities , start talks between the government and opposition and pave the way for an observer team . \nIt was not immediately clear what action the Arab League would take after the deadline passed unheeded by Damascus . \nThe pan-Arab body had threatened sanctions for non-compliance , and it suspended Syria 's membership in a surprise move last week . \nNO NEW TALKS IN SIGHT `` Although the time-frame has ended , there have been no meetings or calls for meetings except at the level of delegations -LRB- to the League -RRB- , '' a representative of one Arab state at the League told Reuters . \nIn a statement , the League said it remained committed to a peaceful , Arab-engineered solution to the Syrian upheaval , touched off by other Arab popular revolts that have overthrown the autocratic leaders of Egypt , Tunisia and Libya this year . \nSyrian authorities blame the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which they say have killed some 1,100 soldiers and police . \nBy a United Nations account , more than 3,500 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in the unrest . \nAssad signaled no retreat from his iron fist policy in a video released after his forces killed 17 more protesters on Saturday . \n`` The only way is to search for the armed people , chase the armed gangs , prevent the entry of arms and weapons from neighboring countries , prevent sabotage and enforce law and order , '' he said in footage published on the Sunday Times website . \nOn Sunday , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops manning roadblocks in Homs fired on residential areas and wounded three protesters . \nIn the nearby town of Talbiseh , security forces delivered the bodies of two men arrested last month and in Idlib another two civilians were killed in military operations , the British-based group said . \nAssad said there would be elections in February or March when Syrians would vote for a parliament to create a new constitution and that would include provision for a presidential ballot . \nThe Syrian Free Army , comprising army defectors and based in neighboring Turkey , claimed responsibility for the attack on the Baath Party building in Damascus . \nThere was no independent verification of the claim and Moualem denied that any attack had taken place . \nBut a witness said security police blocked off the square where the building is located and reported seeing smoke rising from it and fire trucks in the area . \n`` The attack was just before dawn and the building was mostly empty . \nIt seems to have been intended as a message to the regime , '' he said . \nSyrian authorities have barred most independent journalists from entering the country during the revolt , making it difficult to verify accounts from activists and officials . \nIt was the second reported hit on a high profile target in a week , underscoring a growing opposition challenge to Assad - who blames `` armed terrorist acts '' for the unrest - from a nascent insurgency alongside mostly peaceful protests that have persisted despite the intensifying crackdown . \nAssad , who inherited power from his father in 2000 , is a member of the Alawite minority community , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam that dominates the state , the army and security apparatus in the majority Sunni Muslim country of 20 million . \nThe Syrian Free Army said the grenade attack was a response to the refusal of Damascus to release tens of thousands of political prisoners and return troops to barracks , as called for by the plan agreed between the Arab League and Damascus . \nNon-Arab Turkey , once an ally of Assad , is also taking an increasingly tough attitude to Damascus . \nTurkish newspapers said on Saturday Ankara had contingency plans to create no-fly or buffer zones to protect civilians in neighboring Syria if the bloodshed worsens . \n`` It 's almost certain that Bashar al-Assad 's regime is going down , all the assessments are made based on this assumption . \nForeign Ministry sources say that the sooner the regime goes down , the better for Turkey , '' one Turkish paper reported . \nActivists in the central city of Homs said the body of Farzat Jarban , an activist who had been filming and broadcasting pro-democracy rallies there , was found dumped near a private hospital on Saturday with two bullet wounds . \n`` Security police are no longer just shooting protesters , they are targeting activists when they least suspect it , such as when they take their children to school , '' said a doctor from Homs who has fled to Jordan . \nTanks and troops deployed in Homs after large anti-Assad protests six months ago . \nThe authorities say they have since arrested tens of `` terrorists '' in the city who have been killing civilians and planting bombs in public places . \nMoualem said the West and some Arab countries were ignoring the actions of armed gangs in Syria who had been killing people `` according to their identity cards , '' referring to growing reports of sectarian killings between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite community in Homs . \nBut he dismissed fears that the country might be heading toward civil conflict . \n`` There will not be a civil war , however hard they try to ignite it . '' \nDissident colonel Riad al-Asaad , organizing defectors in Syria from his new base in southern Turkey , denied government allegations that adjacent states were allowing arms smuggling into Syria . \n`` Not a single bullet '' had been smuggled from abroad , he told al Jazeera television . \nWeapons were brought by defectors , obtained in raids on the regular army or bought from arms dealers inside Syria , he said . \nAsaad said no foreign military intervention was needed other than providing a no-fly zone and weapons supplies , and that more deserters would swell his Free Syrian Army 's ranks if there were protected zones to which they could flee . \n`` Soldiers and officers in the army are waiting for the right opportunity , '' he told al Jazeera . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nSyria rebuffs Arab League plan . \nBoy Syria is in real trouble now . \nThat Arab League is one of the toughest paper tigers around you know . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council to condemn President Bashar al-Assad -- though there seemed to be no appetite for Libya-style military intervention . \nAssad 's government has accused armed bands of killing scores of its security men in the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shughour and vowed to send in the army to carry out their `` national duty to restore security '' there . \nTroops with tanks have deployed near the town , prompting many of its 50,000 people to flee . \n`` We are monitoring developments in Syria with concern , '' said Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who has long sought warm relations with Assad . \n`` Syria should change its attitude toward civilians and should take its attitude to a more tolerant level . \n`` It is out of the question for Turkey to close its doors to refugees coming from Syria .

Security Council a draft resolution on condemning Syria 's crackdown on protesters , despite the risk of a Russian veto . \n`` And if anyone votes against that resolution or tries to veto it , that should be on their conscience , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said , in a pointed reference to efforts to secure Russian backing for it . \nThe draft resolution condemns the repression and demands humanitarian access , Cameron said in London . \nBut it was unclear how Russia , which holds a veto , would vote . \nCiting NATO 's inconclusive bombing of Tripoli , Moscow says it will not back intervention against Syria in the Security Council . \nWestern diplomats said they did not expect a vote on Wednesday but hoped it might come before the end of the week . \nThe original draft resolution , which diplomats say has been amended only slightly since last month , urges countries not to supply weapons to Damascus but would not provide for an actual arms embargo or other specific punitive measures . \nOne diplomat said the amendments attempted to make it look less like a prelude to further action like the military action that NATO has conducted in Libya , which Moscow has opposed . \nAt the same time , a senior European diplomat told reporters in Washington that European Union nations are preparing a third round of sanctions against Syria that target Syrian companies . \nAt Jisr al-Shughour , residents have said since Tuesday that they were taking cover and bracing for attacks . \nRami Abdulrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a convoy of tank-carriers with 60 tanks and about a dozen trucks carrying troops were seen moving on the main Aleppo highway in the direction of Jisr al-Shughour . \n`` When they -LRB- troops -RRB- passed the town of Saraqeb , protesters threw stones , prompting troops to open fire , killing one person , '' Abdulrahman told Reuters . \nEarlier he said troops had deployed in neighboring villages , including Ariha to the east and on the main highway to the city of Latakia to the southwest . \nResidents said about 40 tanks and armored vehicles were about 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- from Jisr al-Shughour . \nAssad has expelled Reuters correspondents and barred most independent media , making it impossible to verify such accounts . \nA witness in Damascus told Reuters he saw 40 tanks and armored vehicles and trucks able to carry some 400 troops heading north on Tuesday toward the cities Homs and Hama . \nDespite enthusiasm for pro-democracy movements that have unseated presidents in Tunisia and Egypt , few Western leaders -- let alone their autocratic Arab partners -- have shown a will to intervene in Syria , an Iranian ally whose volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups sits astride a web of regional conflicts . \n`` Assad is finished , but we have to see how this regime will crumble , '' said Burhan Ghalyoun , a Syrian opposition and academic at the Sorbonne in Paris . \nAssad 's family and supporters from the minority Alawite sect have dominated Syria since his late father seized power 41 years ago . \nHe has responded with promises of reform , and a crackdown on protesters in towns across the country . \nJisr al-Shughour is home mainly to people from the Sunni Muslim majority . \nThe security forces are mostly run by Alawites . \nNeighbouring countries , including Israel and Turkey , worry a collapse into chaos in Syria could set off sectarian conflict . \nActivists have reported incidents of soldiers who have defected from the army because they could no longer bear to open fire on protesters , but those accounts have been hard to verify . \nIn the latest of several similar videos distributed over the Internet by anti-government activists , a man presented as a soldier from the province around Jisr al-Shughour said the protests were peaceful and called on fellow soldiers to quit . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council a draft resolution on Wednesday condemning Syria 's crackdown on protesters , despite the risk of a Russian veto . \nThe U.N. ambassadors of the four European Union countries told reporters they presented the draft at a council meeting at which the 15-nation body was briefed by a senior U.N. official on the unrest in Syria . \nThere was no vote on the latest draft resolution , which may be amended further . \nBritish Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said the text had been revised to respond to developments in Syria and concerns raised by some council members . \n`` We hope that all members of the Security Council will be able to rally to it , '' Lyall Grant said . \n`` We hope that it will get overwhelming support and that we will be able to go to the vote in the next few days . '' \nThree months of popular unrest in Syria has cost more than 1,000 lives , according to human rights groups . \nFrench Ambassador Gerard Araud said the worsening situation made it necessary for the council to take a stand on the issue . \n`` Our concern is that the country could fall into a civil war , '' he said . \n`` The council has to act . '' \nLyall Grant said negotiators would meet again to discuss the draft on Thursday morning . \nSeveral diplomats said there could be a vote on Friday . \nThe United States , which diplomats say has been reluctant to risk a Russian veto of a U.N. condemnation that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will almost certainly ignore , is not a sponsor of the resolution . \nHowever , U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington had offered its `` strong support for that text . '' \nRussia and China , which both hold vetoes , have made clear they dislike the idea of council involvement , which they say could help to destabilize a strategic Middle Eastern country . \nSeveral diplomats told Reuters they expected Russia to veto the draft resolution , though others said they thought Moscow could be persuaded to abstain , in which case China would likely follow suit . \n`` I hear that the veto is inevitable , '' one diplomat said . \nResolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes to pass . \nIf Russia and China abstained , the draft would be adopted , even if Lebanon , South Africa , India and Brazil voted against it . \nWhile Russia has long been an ally and key arms supplier to Syria , diplomats said the Russians made clear they did not want a repeat of the NATO intervention in Libya , which Moscow believes has spun out of control beyond the original U.N. mandate to protect civilians . \nWithout mentioning Russia , China and India by name , Rice dismissed the comparisons with Libya . \n`` We heard several council members , in some instances ... disingenuously , use Libya as an excuse , as a ploy to avoid the real issues that we are facing in Syria , '' Rice said . \nIn a challenge to Russia and Beijing , British Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament in London , `` If anyone votes against that resolution or tries to veto it , that should be on their conscience . '' \nLike an earlier draft first circulated to council members last month , the latest text urges countries not to supply weapons to Damascus but does not provide for an actual arms embargo or other specific punitive measures . \nThe draft , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters , condemns `` systematic '' human rights violations by Syrian authorities and says they may amount to crimes against humanity . \nBut it also denounces violence against security forces . \nOne diplomat said the new amendments attempted to make the resolution look less like a prelude to further action such as the military intervention that NATO has conducted in Libya . \nIn particular , a new clause says that `` the only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process . '' \nRussian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin gave no hints as to whether or not he planned to veto the draft resolution . \n`` Things are being crossed out -LRB- in the text -RRB- , '' he said as he entered the council chambers . \n`` I need to see a clean copy .

'' \nHungary 's Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi , who oversaw negotiations with Croatia during Budapest 's six-month EU presidency that ends Thursday , offered assurances that the bloc 's 27 governments aimed to admit it in two years . \n`` If everything goes well , Croatia will be a member in July 2013 , '' he told a news conference in Brussels . \nIn the meantime , EU policymakers will monitor Zagreb 's ability to ensure the independence of judges and its track record in putting corrupt officials behind bars , seeking reassurances that democratic change is genuine . \nThe worry among some EU members is that Croatia could follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria , which backtracked on anti-graft reforms after their accession in 2007 . \nTheir failure to stay on track -- and concerns over the cost of EU expansion at a time of economic difficulties in many European countries -- had been a major factor behind a growing reluctance among EU voters to admit new members in recent years . \nIn Croatia , which would be one of the EU 's poorest countries once admitted , policymakers are hoping for an economic boost from EU aid after accession and a rebound in foreign investment , decimated throughout the region by global woes . \nSupport for EU membership is on the rise in Croatia , but many people still fret about giving access to its lucrative island tourism to foreign investors . \nCroats are also frustrated by pressure from the West to come to terms with their role in the Balkan wars in the 1990s . \nBut EU policymakers hope by admitting the country of 4.4 million people they can rejuvenate enthusiasm towards the EU throughout the Western Balkans and kick-start stalled reforms . \nHaving large swathes of its neighboring Balkans mired in ethnic strife and political infighting that block democratic reforms is an embarrassment to Europe as it tries to assert its global clout and pro-reform credentials . \n`` This represents the achievement of a historic goal for Croatia ... -LRB- and -RRB- shows the way for other countries of the region in pursuing their European future , '' Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said in statement . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed what she called an important milestone and said in a statement : `` The conclusion of accession talks for Croatia creates a positive momentum which I hope will spread throughout the region .

'' \nStrauss-Kahn , 62 , who was seen as a front-runner for the French presidency until his arrest , has been charged with trying to rape a hotel housekeeper in New York . \nHe has denied the charges and his lawyer has said he will plead not guilty . \nA person familiar with the work TD International did for Strauss-Kahn in 2007 said his representatives consulted the firm informally after his arrest last Saturday and asked for advice related to his predicament . \nIf the firm at some point becomes formally involved in his defense , the source said , its role will be in helping other Strauss-Kahn advisors , including Paris-based public relations experts , engage in `` crisis management .

'' \nThe attitude of Saudi Arabia , which has traditionally played an equivocal role in Yemeni politics , could be decisive . \n`` The Saudis will seize the opportunity ... to extend his medical recovery into a political rest , '' said Yemen expert Khaled Fattah . \nThe risk of Yemen descending into Somalia-style anarchy was `` a nightmare for Saudi national security . '' \nThe kingdom took Saleh in for urgent hospital care on what a Saudi official termed humanitarian grounds . \n`` We do n't interfere in his decision -LRB- to stay or return -RRB- , '' the official said . \nThat may be Riyadh 's public stance , but the United States and its European allies will be quietly pressing the Saudis to ensure that Saleh 's absence from Yemen becomes permanent . \nThe Saudi cabinet said Monday that Gulf states would pursue effort to broker an agreed transfer of power . \n`` I do n't think the Saudis or his people want him back , '' said a Western diplomat . \n`` He does n't have regional support . \nI 'd be surprised if he came back and it 's too nice a let-out for him . '' \nSaleh , however , initially delayed traveling because he was seeking assurances from Saudi King Abdullah that he would be able to return after treatment , a Yemeni government source said . \nSaudi Arabia is Yemen 's main aid donor and has also long funded Yemeni tribes to maximize its own influence , but it has struggled to manage the crisis in its neighbor , failing to get Saleh to sign a Gulf-brokered plan for him to relinquish power . \n`` I 'm not sure Saudi Arabia is the infallible snake charmer that people on the outside believe it to be , '' Johnsen said . \nAfter nearly 33 years in power , Saleh has left the Arab world 's poorest nation close to chaos and economic collapse . \nA shaky truce has calmed Sanaa after two weeks of fighting between Saleh 's forces and a powerful tribal federation in which more than 200 people were killed and thousands forced to flee . \nThe president may have handed over to his faceless deputy , Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi , but some of his sons and nephews remain in charge of well-equipped military and security units . \nThey have the firepower to challenge General Mohsen Ali , a Saleh kinsman who defected to the opposition with his troops , or to take on the Hashed tribesmen who have fought Saleh loyalists . \nOthers who will demand a say include a disparate axis of Islamist and leftist parties , as well as the youthful protesters who want a `` new Yemen '' -- a civil state ruled by democracy , not the corrupt patronage politics that stamped Saleh 's rule . \n`` There is no single institution or individual in Yemen who is capable of exerting control , '' said Fattah . \n`` Yemen 's formal structures such as political parties and government institutions are in no position to shape events . \nThe divided military , on the other hand , is a reflection of tribal coalitions and elite struggle , not state power , '' he added . \nA possible roadmap for transition would involve forming a national council of tribal elders , generals , clerics and opposition politicians -- including representatives of rebels in the north and south -- as well as the emerging youth movement . \nThe opposition coalition has endorsed the vice-president 's assumption of power as a first step in the transition , ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections . \nFor many Yemenis , the turmoil since January has compounded a struggle for survival in a land where rapid population growth has further stressed scarce water , food and other resources . \n`` In the very short term , the priority is demilitarization of public life , summoning all military units back to barracks and pulling tribal militia from the streets of Sanaa , '' Fattah said . \nMany people , including those internally displaced , may need humanitarian relief until basic services can be restored . \nAny new government will struggle to rescue Yemen from economic disaster or to satisfy 23 million people seeking relief from crippling poverty , corruption and failing public services . \n`` The top priority will be creating jobs , '' said Johnsen . \n`` This is going to be very difficult . \nThe next government will really have its hands full . \nIt will have to make very difficult decisions which will anger many portions of the population . '' \nIronically , the single most effective way to reduce unemployment in Yemen , would be for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf oil producers to open their doors to Yemeni migrant workers . \nJohnsen said the United States and Europe could try to convince the Gulf countries fretting about instability in Yemen that this would serve their own interest , as well the West 's . \n`` That would be a tough sell for the Obama administration , given historic Saudi fears about letting Yemenis in .

'' \nTrade sources said that repairs and testing of the pipeline would take around two weeks from when the work begins . \n`` When that will be remains unknown and depends on the willingness of tribes to allow it to happen , '' one source said . \nYemenis celebrated on Monday what many hoped will be a new era without President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who is now recuperating in Saudi Arabia after an operation to remove shrapnel from his chest a day earlier . \nThe future remains uncertain for Yemen , home to an al Qaeda wing aiming to exploit a potential power vacuum in a nation near vital global oil transport links and torn by complex rivalries among tribal leaders , generals and politicians . \nYemen produced a total of around 260,000 bpd of crude oil in 2010 . \nAround 110,000 bpd of that is light crude , which is in short supply globally after Libyan output came to a virtual standstill due to a revolt there . \nIn recent weeks Yemen has tried to boost fuel imports to make up for the closure of the Aden refinery . \n`` There are several vessels due -- two in the next coming days for diesel to be used in power stations , -LRB- and -RRB- at least one cargo of gasoline . \nBut the thing is they 're running out of fuel very quickly , '' the shipping source said . \nA trade source said fuel shortages have meant fuel prices have soared , with a 20-litre container of petrol in bigger cities such as Aden costing 1,500 rials -LRB- $ 7.01 -RRB- and much higher at around 7,000 rials in more remote areas . \n`` People are buying fuel where they can and taking it to other areas where supplies are more scarce , '' the source said . \nWhile Yemen 's light Marib crude output has been shut since mid-March , heavier Masila crude output and exports have so far been unaffected . \nAny descent into chaos in Yemen , the Arab world 's poorest country , which lies next to oil giant Saudi Arabia and major shipping lanes , would alarm Gulf neighbors and Western powers worried about al Qaeda . \n"}
{"id": "221", "time": "2011-06-01", "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Jun 1 , 2011 1:21 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Months of political paralysis and a crisis in neighboring Syria have harmed Lebanon 's security , a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday , days after a bomb attack wounded six U.N. peacekeepers . \nSpecial Coordinator for Lebanon Michael Williams said the attack , which followed the kidnapping of seven Estonians and a deadly incident last month on the Israeli border , was part of an `` eroding and deteriorating '' security situation . \nLebanon has been without a proper functioning government since January when the Syrian - and Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its political allies brought down the government of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri , who has Western and Saudi support . \nEfforts to form a government have made little progress and the 10-week unrest in Syria has escalated tensions . \nDamascus ended a prolonged military presence in 2005 , but remains a powerful player in a country still defined by the political and religious faultlines which fueled its 1975-1990 civil war . \n`` We see signs of the security situation deteriorating in general , and disturbingly that the institutions of the state are not responding in the way that they should , '' Williams told Reuters at his U.N. office in the hills above Beirut . \nHe said the main concern was a political vacuum caused by the lack of government . \nAlthough Lebanese are accustomed to protracted wrangling over new cabinets , the current impasse was unusually fraught and likely to drag on for months , he said . \n`` The risk is greater now . \nOne , because of the absence of a government . \nTwo , because of the crisis in Syria . \nAnd three , because there is some fragility now along the Blue Line -LRB- U.N.-mapped frontier with Israel -RRB- . '' \nThe Israeli army fired on a demonstration at the Lebanese border village of Maroun al-Ras two weeks ago , killing 11 Palestinians marking the `` catastrophe '' 63 years ago of the founding of Israel , security sources said . \nSimilar protests may take place on Sunday 's anniversary of the 1967 war when Israel seized the Golan Heights and West Bank . \nSeven Estonians are still missing after being seized in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley after crossing the border from Syria in March , in a kidnapping which Williams and EU envoy Angelina Eichorst described as a dark reminder of Lebanon 's civil war . \nIn another sign of fraying authority , rival security forces came close to confrontation last week in a standoff at a state-owned telecoms firm when caretaker Telecommunications Minister Charbel Nahhas was denied access to the building . \n`` It is another indication of the deterioration in the security situation and the inability of state institutions to manage , '' Williams said . \nThe political standoff and security fears also threaten Lebanon 's economy , with growth projections trimmed , tourism revenues expected to fall , and no progress on Lebanon 's plans to explore for oil and gas in the Mediterranean . \n`` I frankly find it distressing and troubling that the country is losing opportunities now . \nIt 's obvious that the economic situation is deteriorating , '' Williams said . \nFriday 's bombing of the Italian peacekeepers , one of whom remains `` in a very grave condition , '' was the first such attack in three years on UNIFIL . \n`` We do n't see the attack in isolation , '' Williams said . \n`` Although it is the first on UNIFIL in a very long time we see the attack in the present security context . '' \nExpressing concern and surprise at Saturday 's announcement that Italy -- which has the largest UNIFIL troop contingent -- will cut its peacekeeping force to 1,100 from 1,780 , Williams said he would travel to Rome next week for talks . \nUNIFIL was expanded to about 12,000 troops and naval personnel under a U.N. Security Council resolution which halted the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war in south Lebanon . \nIt operates alongside 15,000 Lebanese army troops who are deployed to keep the peace and prevent weapons transfers in an area which is a stronghold of Hezbollah guerrillas . \nDespite a deadly border clash last August , Williams said the cessation of hostilities since 2006 had held `` remarkably well . '' \n`` What 's been achieved is stability on the Blue Line and in southern Lebanon for the first time in decades . \nIn a way that is why I am most worried now .

'' \nLibyan rebel spokesman Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said the rebels do not trust Gaddafi or his prime minister . \n`` By talking about a cease-fire , he just wants NATO to stop its strikes on its communications centres , '' Ghoga said in comments broadcast on Dubai-based Al Arabiyah television . \nWhite House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes , speaking at the Group of Eight summit in France , also said the United States did not see the new Libyan cease-fire offer as credible because it was not accompanied by action . \nLibya was not complying with U.N. demands and its forces were still attacking population centres , so the United States would continue with the military campaign , he told reporters . \nThe prime minister scorned the rebel Transitional National Council , recognized by a handful of states as Libya 's legitimate representative , as former members of the same order they aim to overthrow . \n`` Now they absolve themselves of everything . \nWho was responsible for the security file ? \nThey were , and now they are on the other side , calling on NATO to do the job for them , '' he said . \nBut he said the door was open for talk with the rebels nonetheless . \n`` We are ready to speak with popular groups that represent all of Libya , anyone in that framework we welcome , whether he is in the council or not . \nAll Libyans are welcome at the roundtable to talk . '' \nHis remarks came as Spain confirmed it had received an offer of an immediate cease-fire from him . \nHe declined to elaborate on that offer , or others Spain said Libya had made , and called for a fixed date to implement a cease fire . \nGaddafi , who Libya says NATO is trying to assassinate , was alive and well , Mahmudi said . \n`` He 's in good health , handling his duties , in fine condition and he has no restrictions on his movements Libyans know he 's fine , '' he said . \n`` When we need him , we contact him or he contacts us . \nWe ask about his health .

'' \nRussia and China , veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council , have resisted efforts by Washington and its European allies to step up the international response to Syria 's repression of nearly six months of protests . \nAssad has reacted to the uprising , inspired by revolts which have toppled three North African leaders this year , with military assaults on protest centers and mass arrests . \nOn Monday , residents and local activists said Syrian forces killed at least 15 villagers in raids in the countryside around Hama in what they said was one of the biggest military assaults since the uprising broke out . \nAt least 2,000 troops backed by dozens of armored vehicles fired machineguns at random and stormed several villages and towns in the al-Ghab Plain , agricultural land northwest of Hama , they said . \nResidents and activists had reported earlier that several thousand soldiers and hundreds of armored vehicles had massed in the last 24 hours in areas north of Hama which had seen large protests calling for Assad 's removal . \nSyrian opposition group Sawasiah said on Sunday 113 civilians had been killed in the last week , during which activists and diplomats say Syrian forces stepped up raids to detain protest coordinators . \nDamascus blames armed groups for the violence . \nAssad 's media adviser Bouthaina Shaaban , speaking on a trip to Moscow on Monday , gave a lower death toll than the United Nations and said half of the fatalities were among security forces . \n`` According to our information , 700 people were killed on the side of the army and police and 700 on the side of the insurgents , '' Shaaban told reporters through a translator . \nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the United Nations figure was based on `` reliable sources on the ground . '' \n`` The number of those killed since the onset of the unrest in mid-March ... has now reached at least 2,600 , '' Pillay told the U.N. Human Rights Council . \nShe did not identify the sources . \nSyria has barred Pillay 's investigation team and most foreign journalists from entering the country . \nSyria had also repeatedly blocked U.N. efforts to get human rights monitors into the country , U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Valerie Amos said . \nThe United Nations on Monday named a three-member panel of international experts to investigate human rights violations including possible crimes against humanity since the protests began . \nSergio Pinheiro of Brazil will lead the commission of inquiry , which the U.N. Human Rights Council agreed to set up last month to probe arbitrary executions , excessive use of force and killings and report back by the end of November . \nFRANCE WANTS `` CLEAR UN RESOLUTION '' France , Britain , the United States , Germany and Portugal have circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that called for sanctions against Assad , influential relatives and close associates , but it met resistance from Russia and China . \n`` I think it 's a scandal not to have a clear position of the U.N. in such a terrible crisis , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday . \n`` We think that the regime has lost its legitimacy . \nWe think that it 's too late to implement a level of reform . \nWe should adopt in New York a very clear resolution condemning the violence . '' \nMedvedev said Russia believed any resolution must be `` tough but balanced , and addressed to both sides in Syria , '' and that it must not automatically lead to further sanctions because `` there is already a large number of sanctions against Syria . '' \nSyrian demonstrators have demanded international protection to stop civilian killings , but there has been no hint in the West of any appetite for military action along the lines of the NATO bombing that helped topple Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi . \nIntervention would be a daunting prospect in a country in the heart of the volatile Middle East . \nSyria has three times Libya 's population , supports Palestinian and Lebanese militant groups and has a strong alliance with Iran . \nIt remains formally at war with Israel , retains influence in Lebanon and has a sizeable Kurdish minority in its east . \nAfter talks in Damascus with Assad , Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby said they had agreed on a series of measures that he would present to league member states to help end the violence . \nAssad has announced some reforms such as ending emergency law and launching a `` national dialogue . '' \nOpponents say these have made little difference . \nAmong hundreds of Syrians arrested in recent days was leading psychoanalyst Rafah Nashed , 66 , who has been treating people traumatized by the mounting repression , her friends said . \nSyrian authorities do not comment on arrests but have said in the past that any arrests are made in accordance with the constitution . \n-LRB- Additional reporting Robert Evans and Stephanie Nebehayin Geneva and Gleb Bryanski in Moscow and N.

'' \nSeveral thousand Syrians have fled to Turkey in the wake of the repression launched after pro-democracy protests erupted in March . \nAmong them were soldiers who say they deserted rather than shoot their own people , and are now part of the armed resistance against Assad 's forces . \nTurkey , along with other powers , fear that if Syria slips into civil war it would ignite sectarian and ethnic conflict that could spread elsewhere in the region . \nRuled by the Assad family for more than 40 years , Syria 's power circle is based around the Baath party and members of the minority Alawite sect to which the Assad family belong . \nThe Radikal newspaper 's columnist Murat Yetkin quoted one of the Turkish officials saying : `` We believe that with each day that passes under the Assad regime , the threat to stability increases . \nWe believe stability in Syria and in the region will only be possible again under a democratic government . '' \nThe Arab League , and non-Arab Turkey , have threatened economic sanctions unless bloodshed stops . \nAnd Turkish officials told the journalists they expected Assad 's government to implode under popular pressure . \nTurkey wants to avoid a massive influx of people across the border , having been inundated by 500,000 people from Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War . \nRadikal 's Yetkin said the Turkish military could establish a buffer zone if the Syrian army advanced on a city , like Aleppo , close to the Turkish border . \nColumnist Asli Aydintasbas of Milliyet newspaper wrote : `` Foreign ministry sources added that Turkey could set up a no-fly buffer zone within Syria if Syrians fleeing the army create a mass wave of migration to Turkey . \n`` A more extensive military intervention could come on the table only if Syrian regime starts a large-scale massacre in a big city such as Aleppo or Damascus , '' Aydintasbas added . \n`` Ankara could take a role in a military intervention against Syria only with the international community and following a U.N. Security Council decision . '' \nHaving once cultivated Assad 's friendship , Turkey turned sharply critical during the eight-month-old uprising , as Damascus repeatedly ignored advice to end the violence and make reforms demanded by the people . \nAttacks on their diplomatic missions in Damascus last weekend , prompted non-Arab Turkey and Arab governments to escalate pressure on Assad . \nPrime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Syria was responsible for the breakdown in the relationship . \n`` Unfortunately , the Syrian regime was reluctant and insincere in carrying out reforms it had promised to . \nFurthermore , they wanted to quash the opposition through inhumane methods , by shedding blood , '' he told a business forum . \n`` If there 's a policy change , it 's not Turkey 's but Syria 's change of policy . \nSyria has not kept the promises it made , neither to the Arab League nor the world , '' he said . \n`` Its actions have not been sincere and trustworthy .

'' \nDemocracy is overtaking autocracy , he said , and `` dictatorial systems are burning down to the ground . '' \nTurkey , a NATO member and aspirant to join the European Union , is viewed as a bridge between the Western and Islamic worlds . \nErdogan has had unprecedented access to Obama , holding nine phone calls with the U.S. president this year . \n`` Personally , Barack Obama is someone I really like . \nAnd vis-a-vis his policies and his implementations , I want him to be much more successful , '' Erdogan said , wishing him luck in the November 2012 elections . \nBut the United States and Turkey differ greatly on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians as a showdown looms over Palestinian statehood at the United Nations . \nAnkara 's once-friendly ties with Israel crumbled over the killing of Turkish activists on a Gaza-bound aid convoy by Israeli forces last year . \n`` In this situation , no matter who we are speaking about , democracy , rights and freedom should be defended , '' Erdogan said . \n`` We gave our warnings to Israel . \nThis is the reason for war . \nThis is something you can not do in international waters . \nBut as a great state , we have been very forgiving . \nThat 's why we have been very patient . '' \nTurkey has demanded Israel apologize , pay compensation and lift the Gaza embargo . \n`` If these demands are not met , the relations between Turkey and Israel will never become normal again . \nWe have got nothing against the people of Israel but against the attitude adopted by the administration of Israel , '' Erdogan said . \n`` And if you are insistent on creating a source of unrest , you are bound to become lonelier and lonelier . \nThey used to be great friends of ours . \nAnd this solitude is Israel 's fate under these circumstances . '' \nTurkey has embraced Palestine 's position for statehood , while Obama has said he would block any Palestinian bid for full recognition at the U.N. Security Council . \n`` SO FED UP WITH WARS '' Erdogan sought to address perceptions that Turkey is moving toward a more Islamic foreign policy , abandoning a history of pro-Western sentiment . \n`` We seek out knowledge from whichever part of the world that is most advanced , '' he said . \n`` We do n't want to see the clash of civilizations in this world . \nWe want to see the alliance of civilizations . \nThe world is so fed up with wars . '' \nThe prime minister tried to calm concerns over plans for a missile defense base in Turkey , saying the installation is a NATO concept and not a factor in Iran 's tensions with Israel . \n`` We do n't think Iran should get offended when there 's no reason . \nWe do n't want to see Israel coming up with different interpretations from what is actually the reality , '' he said . \nHe questioned why Iran should be banned from having nuclear technology while Israel is allowed to be the only country in the region with nuclear weapons . \n`` Iran says that its only purpose is to generate affordable energy through nuclear power . \nWe do not want to act on presumptions , and no sanctions based on presumptions are acceptable by Turkey , '' Erdogan said . \nHe also addressed reports he had taken holidays with Assad , whose crackdown on protests in Syria has led to U.S. calls for the long-time leader to step aside . \nErdogan said Assad was invited to a popular holiday locale but it was to discuss relations between the two countries and the two leaders never took a vacation together . \nHe said he finally lost patience with Assad . \n`` If you 're going to act against the fundamental rights , liberties and the law , you will lose your position in my heart as my brother and my friend , '' Erdogan said . \n`` I was very patient . \nPatience , patience , patience . \nAnd then I cracked .

'' \nGeoff Tunnicliffe , Vancouver-based secretary general of the World Evangelical Alliance , told Reuters his organization had recently issued a code of conduct for responsible missionary work with the Vatican and World Council of Churches . \n`` I do n't see this as a blanket statement on evangelicals , which includes Pentecostals , '' he said . \nThe three groups that signed the pioneering code of conduct in June , after five years ' work , claim to represent over 90 percent of Christianity . \nWhile stressing Christian unity , Benedict deflected recent public appeals from Protestants for a relaxation of rules barring them from participating in Catholic communion . \nHe said it was a `` political misunderstanding '' to think he would come with an `` ecumenical gift '' such as permission for Protestants to receive the Catholic eucharist . \nGermany 's top Protestant bishop urged the pontiff to take `` real steps for reconciliation '' before the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017 , which the Protestants would like to mark with Catholic participation . \nLuther is `` as a hinge between our two churches , because he belongs to both , '' said Lutheran Bishop Nikolaus Schneider , head of the Evangelical Church in Germany . \n`` It is time to heal the memories of the mutual injuries in the Reformation period and the subsequent history of our Churches . '' \nChancellor Angela Merkel , daughter of a Lutheran pastor , attended the service highlighted by interludes of sacred organ music by Johann Sebastian Bach and other German composers . \nErfurt , where atheism is also widespread after four decades of communism , gave the pope a cool reception . \nThere were few posters or banners announcing his presence . \nIn a shop near the cathedral , atheist Dagmar Schneidert said : `` I do n't know anyone who is enthusiastic about the visit , only 7 percent of people in Erfurt are Catholic anyway . \nIt 's wasted money that could be used for something more meaningful . '' \nThe pope is due to hold an open-air mass in central Erfurt on Saturday at which Church officials expect 85,000 Catholics . \nAt Etzelsbach , in the Eichsfeld region near the former Iron Curtain between East and West Germany , Benedict praised Catholics for keeping the faith despite pressure from `` two godless dictatorships '' -- Nazism and Communism . \n`` Eichsfeld is a very religious place , '' said Holungen Wiebert , 67 . \n`` We 're very proud to have a German pope again , for the first time in 500 years . '' \nPolish , Croatian and Bavarian flags in the crowd indicated some pilgrims had come long distances to see the pope . \nBefore leaving Berlin , Benedict met leaders of Germany 's four million Muslims and promised cooperation with them as long as they respect Germany 's constitution and the limits it sets on pluralism . \nMerkel warned Muslims last year that sharia , Islamic law , had no place in Germany . \nMuslim leaders praised the pope for confirming through the meeting that Islam was now a part of German society , but said their loyalty to the constitution was never in question . \n`` As Muslims in Germany , we have always said that we see the German constitution as a good basis for peaceful life together , '' said Bekir Alboga , head of interreligious dialogue for the Turkish mosque association DITIB . \nHe said the pope 's short address also represented a change from his controversial 2006 speech in Regensburg , where his use of a Byzantine emperor 's quote about Islam being violent and irrational provoked protests across the Muslim world . \n`` The pope has now chosen a new approach in his meeting with Muslims , '' Alboga said . \n`` I think one must look to the future and see where the possibilities for good cooperation are .

add 10,000 cattle to his ranch on the edge of the Amazon . \nBut instead of burning down forest for his growing herd to graze freely he will break with tradition , reducing his pastureland and adding grain to their diet . \nVal is one of a growing number of farmers betting on so-called integrated farming by diversifying production and revenue . \nHis move epitomizes a quiet and fragile revolution that marks a departure from Brazil 's slash-and-burn past . \nIt is a trend that may also help ease the felling of the world 's largest rain forest . \nSoy growers are rotating fields with more corn and cotton , planting forest and raising cattle . \nRanchers are planting corn to supplement their herd 's traditional diet of grasses . \nThis tends toward greater and more efficient output while easing pressure for expanding area , and bodes well for the consumers struggling worldwide with higher food prices , as well as conservationists who see Brazil as a crucial battlefield . \nSuch investments in yield are not new in the United States or Europe . \nThey are , however , in the tropical grain and cattle belt of Brazil , which means there are risks and uncertainties . \n`` I lose 80 calves a year to jaguars , '' Val said from a dark hardwood paneled farm house in southern Para state , where any movement more complex than breathing triggers perspiration . \nVal , a Sao Paulo University-educated sociologist , is one of a growing number of farmers taking a more scientific view of production . \nHe has hired consultants to help acquire a whole new set of skills in grain farming . \nYet , he still embodies many of the older ruralist sentiments that thrived here in an era defined by man-versus-nature . \nThe jungle and the bush were the enemy . \nBrazil , with its chronic social inequalities , relied on homesteading until the last decade to populate and secure its vast , United States-sized Val 's father packed 40 days by burro to the area that is now Redencao in 1959 -- aging black-and-white photographs of that trek don the walls of his son 's farm house . \nThe shoot-from-the-hip , pioneering spirit is still revered here . \nHe secured government financing to clear 220 square miles of forested land that he had bought title to and named Santa Teresa Ranch . \nThe family has since sold off most of the farm . \nThe dictatorship of the time threatened to repossess homesteaders ' land if they failed to improve it , which meant clearing the forest to raise cattle and plant crops . \nUnbridled expansionist policies eventually brought environmental and trade pressure to a head in the last decade , on fears the Amazon would be lost , hastening global warming . \nGovernment efforts to rein in agriculture also threaten to derail the very investments needed by farmers to keep yields improving in existing areas and for orderly , legal expansion . \nBrazil 's 5.3-million square mile area still has over 625,000 square miles of unutilized land that could be legally converted to agricultural ends , according to the IBGE . \nKatia Abreu , a senator and the head of the National Confederation of Agriculture , estimates that current laws governing land use criminalize 70-90 percent of Brazil 's 5 million growers and ranchers for cutting forest that had been state-sponsored under previous governments . \nSome are guilty of illegal clearing after the laws had forbidden such practices , she admits . \n`` The bulk of them are more victims of bad enforcement of the law , '' Abreu said , adding that a new law before Congress should normalize most farmers ' legal status . \nThe implications for global food prices could be profound . \nChina , Europe and the Middle East are Brazil 's main buyers and a couple percentage points variation in its output of soy , beef , sugar and coffee could send market prices reeling . \nVal plans to invest 3 million reais -LRB- $ 1.8 million -RRB- to plant corn on 9 square miles of his 88 square miles of pasture . \nThe remaining 94 square miles of his ranch must remain forested reserve in this part of the Amazon . \nHis farm is in legal order and thus would be eligible for government subsidized financing . \nBut many farms are not . \nFour hours south of Val 's farm by twin-engine plane lies the 80-square-mile Falavinha integrated farm in Deciolandia , Mato Grosso . \nIt was categorized as savanna biome , which means 20-35 percent of the farm had to be forested reserve . \nBut , after authorities redrew Brazil 's biomes , the region may be forced to comply with Amazon Basin requirements of 50 percent reserve . \nThe costs of replanting would be high . \nFederal agencies are also notoriously slow to provide vital services . \nFarms bigger than 3 square miles must submit satellite maps of their land to agrarian reform agency Incra . \nBut farmers say Incra is understaffed for the workload as it is , and the government plans to eventually expand the number of farms to smaller properties that must submit maps . \n`` We spent 10,000 reais to complete the farm 's mapping and submitted it a year ago and still nothing , '' the owner of the farm , Geraldo Falavinha , said over the roar of cotton gins . \n`` We are locked out of government financing and need to invest . '' \nThe keystone to large-scale integrated farming in Brazil is cattle , especially as far as preservation of the Amazon and other tropical biomes are concerned . \nIn Para , Val says he will expand his herd to roughly 30,000 from 20,000 . \nA recent study by the Institute for Atmospheric Research Research singled out cattle ranching as the main agricultural source of pressure behind deforestation . \nInevitably , leaders in Brazilian agriculture and ranching will throw out numbers about the 137,000 square miles of pasture in Brazil that can be easily converted into farmland `` without having to cut a single tree . '' \nBrazil currently plants 66,875 square miles to crops and commercial forest . \nBut converting pasture into planted area is not simple . \nIt raises the question of where the cattle will graze . \nBrazil 's beef production is grass-fed , unlike in the United States and Europe where grain on feedlots is used mostly . \nThe U.S. writer on food Michael Pollan says cattle should be taken off `` their typical feedlot diet of grain '' and allowed `` to eat grass '' , to help bring down sky-high grain prices . \nIn Brazil -- the world 's top exporter of beef and a major grain producer -- many ranchers and farmers would disagree . \n`` Cattle need to eat more grain here to reach slaughter faster . \nThere 's less environmental impact , '' Darci Ferrarin Jr. said his DGF integrated farm in Sorriso , Mato Grosso . \nBrazil could double or triple the cattle per hectare from the present average of nearly 1 head\\/ha simply by introducing grain to their diet , better breeding practices and fertilizing and replanting grasses in pastures , beef analysts say . \n`` We make more money from this type of farming , but nature and consumers benefit , '' he added , while leaning on one of his sister 's prize-winning white Nelore heifers that stands nearly seven-feet-tall and weighs as much as a mid-sized car . \n-LRB- Editing by Todd Benson , Kieran Murray and Alden Bentley -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nResidents of Harasta , the suburb where the Airforce Intelligence compound is located , said army deserters had fired rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns for 10 minutes , provoking a security sweep that netted about 70 people . \nTogether with Military Intelligence , Airforce Intelligence is in charge of preventing dissent within the armed forces . \nSyria blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups who it says have killed more than 1,100 soldiers and police . \nHundreds of people have been killed this month , one of the bloodiest periods in the revolt that began in March . \nCatherine Altalli , of the opposition Syrian National Council , said Wednesday 's assault was understandable after the violence , detention and torture used on peaceful protesters . \n`` I am not saying this is right . \nThere have to be limits , '' she said . \n`` But what is unacceptable is that every day bodies come out with marks of torture from Air Force Intelligence buildings and other secret police dungeons across Syria '' . \nSyria 's pervasive security apparatus , dominated by Assad 's minority Alawite sect , underpins the power structure that has enabled Assad and his father before him to rule for 41 years . \nThe bloodshed in Syria has angered other Arab and Western nations , whose criticism of Assad led to several attacks on diplomatic missions in Damascus and other cities this week . \nSyrian state media said the authorities had vowed to prosecute anyone who carried out such attacks . \nFrance , which withdrew its ambassador from Damascus on Wednesday , said it was encouraging Syrian opposition groups , which include the Paris-based Syrian National Council , but remained opposed to outside military intervention . \n`` We have had contacts with them ... in any case we are helping them , we are encouraging them to get organised , '' Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French BFM radio . \nFrance was the first Western nation to recognize Libyan rebels in March , but has yet to endorse any Syrian group . \nWhile the West appears to have no appetite for military intervention in Syria , a leader of Syria 's outlawed Muslim Brotherhood said Turkish military action might be acceptable . \n`` If other interventions are required , such as air protection , because of the regime 's intransigence , then the people will accept Turkish intervention . \nThey do not want Western intervention , '' Mohammad Riad Shaqfa , who lives in exile in Saudi Arabia , told a news conference in Istanbul . \nAnkara is considering imposing sanctions on Syria , has hosted opponents of Assad and is working with the Arab League to increase pressure on Damascus , but denies any plan to intervene militarily in its southern neighbor . \nNo U.N. sanctions against Syria seem likely given opposition from Russia and China , which last month vetoed a draft Security Council resolution condemning Damascus . \nNow France , Britain and Germany plan to ask the U.N. General Assembly 's human rights committee to approve a resolution condemning the violence in Syria , before putting the non-binding measure to a vote in an Assembly plenary session . \nBurhan Ghalioun , head of the Syrian National Council , called for a calming of sectarian tensions between Alawites and majority Sunni Muslims , especially in the restive city of Homs . \n`` We have seen in the last few weeks kidnappings , assassination and score-settling among members of the same people , even from within the sons of the revolution , which poses a dangerous threat to the gains of the revolution and offers a big service to the regime , '' he said in a statement . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn Tehran , Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi criticised the Arab League for `` acting in a way that will hurt the security of the region . '' \nHe told the official news agency IRNA that Syria , an ally of Iran since 1980 , had repeatedly pledged to meet legitimate popular demands and enact reforms . \n`` Unfortunately , some countries believe that they are outside the crisis ... but they are mistaken because if a crisis happens they will be entangled by its consequences . '' \nSaudi Arabia , which is eager to loosen the ties between its regional rival Iran and Syria , said the Arab League was acting in Syria 's interest , not interfering in its affairs . \n`` What 's important is not about suspending or not suspending -LRB- Syria from the League -RRB- , it 's stopping the bloodshed , starting the dialogue , and withdrawing troops from Syrian cities , '' Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told Al Arabiya channel . \nWestern countries have tightened sanctions on Syria and on Monday Jordan 's King Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to urge Assad to quit after ensuring a smooth handover . \nIn the early months of the uprising , attempts by security forces to crush mainly peaceful protests accounted for most of the violence . \nBut since August there has been a growing number of reports of army defectors and armed civilians fighting back . \nActivists said Free Syrian Army fighters fired machineguns and rockets at a large Air Force Intelligence complex on the northern edge of the capital at about 2:30 a.m. -LRB- 0030 GMT -RRB- . \nA gunfight ensued and helicopters circled over the complex , on the Damascus-Aleppo highway . \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties . \nSyrian state media did not mention the attack . \nThe U.S. State Department said it had few details and no direct confirmation of the incident , but blamed Assad 's crackdown on protesters . \n`` It 's not surprising that we are now seeing this kind of violence , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` We do n't condone it in any way , shape or form . \nBut let 's be very clear that it is the brutal tactics of Assad and his regime in dealing with what began as a non-violent movement is now taking Syria down a very dangerous path . '' \nA Western diplomat in Damascus described the assault as `` hugely symbolic and tactically new , '' saying that if the reported details were true it would be `` much much more coordinated than anything we have seen before . '' \n`` To actually attack a base like this is something else , and so close to Damascus as well , '' said the diplomat , adding that fighting in recent weeks involving army deserters in the town of Rastan and the city of Homs resembled a localized civil war . \n`` It 's not a nationwide civil war , but in very specific locations , it is looking like that , '' said the diplomat . \nThe Free Syrian Army was set up by deserters and is led by Colonel Riad al-Asaad , who is based in southern Turkey . \nIt announced this week that it had formed a `` temporary military council '' of nine defecting officers , led by Asaad . \nThe statement said the Syrian Free Army aimed to `` bring down the regime and protect citizens from the repression ... and prevent chaos as soon as the regime falls , '' adding that it would form a military court to try `` members of the regime who are proven to have been involved in killing operations . '' \nSyrian television showed thousands of Assad 's supporters rallying in Damascus and Latakia to mark the day his father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970 . \nIt said the crowds were also voicing their rejection of the Arab League 's decision . \n`` God , Syria , Bashar , that 's all ! '' \ndemonstrators shouted in central Damascus after turning out in heavy rain to wave flags and posters of the president . \nTwo large posters of Assad and his father hung from a building . \n`` Neither rain nor sanctions will stop us expressing our nationalism , '' they said , according to the television report . \nThe Arab League has stopped short of calling for Assad 's departure or proposing any Libya-style military intervention , but its ostracism of Syria is a blow to a country whose ruling Baath party puts Arab nationalism at the center of its credo . \nSyrian authorities have banned most independent media . \nThey blame the unrest on `` armed terrorist gangs '' and foreign-backed militants who they say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . \nHundreds of people have been killed this month , one of the bloodiest periods of the revolt . \nSyria says it remains committed to the Arab peace plan , which calls for the withdrawal of troops from urban areas , the release of prisoners and a dialogue with the opposition . \nState media said more than 1,000 prisoners , including prominent dissident Kamal Labwani , were freed on Tuesday . \nBut human rights campaigners say tens of thousands have been detained since anti-Assad protests began . \n-LRB- Additional reporting Souhail Karam in Rabat , Dominic Evans in Beirut , John Irish in Paris , Mahmoud Habboush in Dubai and Ramin Mostafavi in Tehran ; Writing by Alistair Lyon ; Editing by Tim Pearce and Eric Walsh -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "3", "time": "2011-05-27", "text": "CAIRO | Fri May 27 , 2011 3:21 pm BST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Thousands of Egyptians packed Cairo 's Tahrir Square on Friday in what organisers called a `` second revolution '' to push for faster reforms and a speedy trial for ousted President Hosni Mubarak and his former aides . \nActivists complain of delays in putting Mubarak , his family and members of his ousted regime on trial and that the army has not restored order quickly enough to the country of 80 million . \nEgyptians are also demanding an end to endemic graft , one of the main grievances that drove thousands of protesters onto the streets in the uprising that began on January 25 . \n`` After some 1,000 martyrs ... people do not see any change , '' said Mustafa Ali Menshawi , a 38-year-old accountant , who was helping marshal crowds flooding into the square . \n`` The only change we see is that the Mubarak metro station has been changed to the Martyrs station , '' he said . \nIn a move seen as aimed at appeasing protesters , authorities on Tuesday ordered Mubarak to stand trial on charges of graft and `` pre-meditated killing '' of protesters during the uprising that ousted him on February 11 . \nIf convicted , Mubarak could face the death penalty . \nHe has been detained at a hospital in the tourist Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh since April when he was reported to have suffered heart problems during an initial questioning . \nHundreds staged a protest in front of the hospital calling for his departure . \nThey said his presence was driving tourists away , according to state TV . \nFLAGS , PLACARDS AND NO SOLDIERS The ruling military council withdrew the army from near the protests in Cairo and has ordered security forces to stay away . \nTahrir Square was decked with Egyptian flags and placards demanding that officials who worked under Mubarak and squandered state funds be investigated . \n`` We want to dissolve all local councils that are famous for being the most and worst corrupt institutions during Mubarak 's regime , '' said Mohammed Adel , of the April 6 Youth group . \n`` We also ask that all political powers get involved in the drafting of important political laws , '' Adel added . \nThousands of Egyptians also took to the streets in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and in the Suez Canal 's cities of Suez and Ismailia . \nSmaller protests also took place in northern Sinai and in the city of Port Said on the Suez Canal . \nHowever , some Egyptians expressed opposition to the protests , saying military rulers needed time to sort things out . \nA few hundred gathered in Cairo 's al-Hussein area to express support for Egypt 's military rulers , chanting : `` For the sake of our country , we want to be ruled by the army . '' \nSome political parties , including Egypt 's powerful Muslim Brotherhood , said no protests were needed and warned they could lead to confrontations between the army and demonstrators . \nThe absence of the Brotherhood angered some protesters , some of whom chanted : `` Where is the Brotherhood ?

{"id": "211", "time": "2011-05-18", "text": "WASHINGTON\\/AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Washington imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other senior officials on Wednesday in a dramatic escalation of pressure on Syria to halt a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests . \nAssad had been partly rehabilitated in the West over the last three years but Western powers have condemned his use of force to quell protests against his 11 years in power , killing at least 700 civilians according to rights groups . \nTargeting Assad personally with sanctions , which the United States and the European Union had previously avoided , is a significant slap at Damascus and raises questions about whether the West may ultimately seek Assad 's removal from power . \n`` The actions the administration has taken today send an unequivocal message to President Assad , the Syrian leadership and regime insiders that they will be held accountable for the ongoing violence and repression in Syria , '' Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a written statement . \nA senior U.S. official said the new sanctions were meant to force Assad to carry out promised political reforms . \n`` President Assad has a clear choice : either to lead this transition to democracy or to leave , '' the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told reporters . \nThe unrest began two months ago when protesters , inspired by other Arab uprisings , called for greater freedoms and an end to corruption . \nThe harsh crackdown on dissent by troops , security forces and irregular Assad loyalists led them to go further and demand an end to Assad 's rule . \nThe U.S. move , announced by the Treasury Department , freezes any of the Syrian officials ' assets that are in the United States or otherwise fall within U.S. jurisdiction and generally bars U.S. individuals and companies from dealing with them . \nIn addition to Assad , the sanctions will target Vice President Farouq al-Shara , Prime Minister Adel Safar , Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Shaar , Defense Minister Ali Habib plus Abdul Fatah Qudsiya , head of Syrian military intelligence , and Mohammed Dib Zaitoun , director of the political security directorate . \nU.S. officials were unable to estimate the value of the assets involved , but leading Syrian opposition figure Haitham al-Maleh said the move meant `` members of the regime are now under siege . '' \n`` Any move by the international community may help the Syrian people in continuing their uprising , '' he told Reuters from Damascus . \nSwitzerland said on Wednesday it would impose travel bans on 13 top Syrian officials -- but not Assad himself -- and freeze any of their assets held in Swiss banks , matching a decision by the European Union last week . \nLast month , Washington imposed a first round of sanctions on two relatives of Assad and the country 's intelligence agency for alleged human rights abuses . \nSyrian authorities blame most of the violence on armed groups backed by Islamists and outside powers who they say have killed more than 120 soldiers and police . \nIn Syria , tanks shelled a border town for the fourth day in the latest targeted military campaign to crush demonstrations . \nTroops went into Tel Kelakh on Saturday , a day after a demonstration there demanded `` the overthrow of the regime , '' the slogan of revolutions that toppled Arab leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and challenged others across the Middle East . \n`` We 're still without water , electricity or communications , '' a resident of Tel Kelakh said by satellite phone . \nHe said the army was storming houses and making arrests , but withdrawing from neighborhoods after the raids . \nIn a sign that the army was coming under fire in the town , he said some families `` are resisting , preferring death to humiliation . '' \nA witness on the Lebanese side of the border said heavy gunfire could be heard from Tel Kelakh . \nAssad told a delegation from the Damascus district of Midan that security forces had made mistakes handling the protests , al Watan newspaper said on Wednesday . \nOne delegate said Assad had told them that 4,000 police would receive training `` to prevent these excesses '' being repeated , it said . \nSyria has barred most international media from operating in the country , making it hard to verify reports from activists and officials . \nProminent human rights lawyer Razan Zaitouna said the army and security forces had killed at least 27 civilians since moving into Tel Kelakh . \nThe state news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying eight soldiers had been killed on Tuesday in Tel Kelakh and in southern Deraa province where protests first broke out exactly two months ago . \nIt said five of the soldiers were killed when an `` armed terrorist group '' fired on a security forces patrol near Tel Kelakh , which is close to Lebanon 's northern border . \nThe Tel Kelakh resident said artillery and heavy machinegun fire hit the main road to Lebanon overnight , as well as the Abraj neighborhood inhabited by minority Turkmen and Kurds . \n`` Most residents of Tel Kelakh have fled . \nSome remaining people tried to escape to Lebanon yesterday but the shelling has been too heavy , '' the resident said . \n`` Abraj residents have issued a call to -LRB- Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip -RRB- Erdogan to help them . \nBut it is like the drowning hanging on to a straw . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAnd nothing is settled yet in any of those countries . \nWill Turkey send that Mavi Marbara to try and provoke Israel again ? \nI hope the State Deptartment warns Turkey in no uncetain terms not to allow that to happen again . \nGod bless President Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu . \nGod bless President Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu . \nThe statement about Obama I agree with but Netanyahu is the biggest crook in the region . \nHis country and it 's various leaders have been inciting violence there for years , stealing lands from innocent Arabs . \nYes I said innocent , you would turn to violence too if someone literally stole your lands from under you and do n't tell me the Israelites had a claim there because the majority of Jews have been in Eastern Europe for almost 1000 years until that madman Hitler came along !!! I wonder if the west realizes that all the `` assistance '' they are giving the people of these mid eastern countries will only back fire in their faces . \nThese countries have been kept `` in check '' by the insane lunatics ruling these countries but now that they are gone or being pushed out by the west , even more insane lunatics and their extremist ideas will fill the vaccuum of power . \nPeople such as extremist islamic clerics will assume power and make it worse on the people than they have it now . \nLook at Afghanistan and Iran as examples , every time `` the West '' -LRB- and when I say the West I mean the USA -RRB- meddles in foreign affairs it backfires in our faces and creates a whole new monster to deal with ! \nLets try this for a few hundred years ... Lets mind our own business and concentrate on the internal affairs of our own nation and let the other nations of the world fix their own problems , for it should not be our young men and women who are dying on foreign soil protecting the people there from the boogey man , they do n't appreciate it anyhow !!!

'' \nOn Monday , Information Minister Adnan Mahmoud said army units would carry out their `` national duty to restore security . '' \nThe government has expelled independent journalists , making it hard to determine clearly what is happening in the country . \nDespite enthusiasm for pro-democracy movements that have unseated dictators in Tunisia and Egypt , few Western leaders -- let alone their autocratic Arab partners -- have shown a will to intervene in Syria , an Iranian ally whose volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups sits astride a web of regional conflicts . \nAssad 's family and supporters from the minority Alawite sect have dominated Syria since his late father seized power 41 years ago . \nHe has responded with promises of reform , and a crackdown on protesters in towns across the country . \nHis officials accuse radical Islamists of fomenting a violent , armed revolt . \nNeighboring countries , including Israel and Turkey , worry that a collapse into chaos could set off sectarian conflict and the emergence of violent , radical Islamists , as happened in Neighboring Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003 . \nBut Western powers kept up pressure . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague , in some of London 's strongest language yet against the 45-year-old leader , told parliament : `` President Assad is losing legitimacy and should reform or step aside . '' \nHe said European governments were looking at further sanctions . \n`` We are working to persuade other countries that the Security Council has a responsibility to speak out , '' Hague added . \nRussia appears opposed to a general condemnation of Assad , let alone authorizing military action against him . \nPresident Barack Obama , who last month urged Assad to lead a transition to democracy or `` get out of the way , '' did not mention Syria in remarks at a news briefing on Tuesday . \nBut in Brussels , Russia 's envoy to the European Union , Vladimir Chizhov , said : `` The prospect of a U.N. Security Council resolution that 's along the same lines as Resolution 1973 on Libya will not be supported by my country ... The use of force , as Libya shows , does not provide answers . '' \nVeto-holding Russia abstained on the Libya vote , allowing NATO to begin a bombing campaign that Western powers say saved civilians in rebel-held Benghazi from an onslaught by Gaddafi 's forces , but which has failed to dislodge the Libyan leader . \nA report that Syria 's ambassador to Paris had quit prompted speculation of rifts in the Syrian elite . \nFrance 24 television aired comments it said was the envoy resigning . \nBut Al-Arabiya later broadcast comments in Arabic that it said were from the same diplomat in which she denied making such a statement . \nIt remained unclear whether there had been some hoax or a change of heart . \nThe ambassador could not be reached to comment . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNo one in the entire country , man , woman , or child has the right to even breathe without asking Assad 's regime -- starting from the bottom of the ranks all the way to the top officals , that is if he\\/she can reach such high ranking officals . \nThis is the way of life for any Syrian , unless that is , they are affiliated with the government . \nThis is how Assad rules the country and will continue to do so . \nAnyone asking for their basic right of freedom will be annihilated . \nAssad will even destroy and attempt to vanish from the entire earth a population of people if anyone dares to , again , ask for their freedom of right to live . \nThis was witnessed in Hama in 1982 . \nStrife and violence is being instigated by Assad and his cronies in Jisr Al-Shaghour intentionally to start a war among the people . \nThere are no armed protestors . \nNo civilian has the right to carry a gun in Syria , unless they are part of the `` Mukhabarat '' . \nBut , like `` awmassey '' wrote , the time has come for Bashar to leave . \nUnfortunately , it is at the expense of the people . \nThe international community must do more than rhetoric . \nOtherwise , the entire population of Syria will be wiped out by Assad , just so he can stay in power . \nAssad is not a reformer . \nHe is a butcher and murderer ! \nJust like his father ! \nThere is a presumption in this article that ought to be examined : that the Middle East uprisings are '' pro-democracy '' in nature . \nThey are in fact '' regime change '' in nature . \nThe vast majority of people in these countries are very unhappy with their leadership and desire change . \nThe idea that the direction of the desired change is toward Western values is almost completely unsupported on the ground and is wishful thinking on the part of people who ought to know better . \nUltimately when all is said and done , we 'll have little reason to rejoice . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nShip owners went on a ship ordering spree before economic turmoil in 2008 hit the sector . \nIt normally takes three years for a ship to hit the water from when it is ordered . \n`` We think this year will become a record delivery year both for capesizes and for bulk carriers in general , '' Svenning said . \n`` The dry bulk market has tanked , there is no doubt about it .

'' \n-LRB- There will be -RRB- strong fleet growth through to 2012 before we see a more benign development in 2013 , '' he said . \nSvenning said there had been expectation that rates would stay soft when they hit a record low in late 2008 . \n`` Then the Chinese came back in the spring of 2009 and saved everybody by increasing imports of iron ore and coal , '' he said . \n`` After two relatively good years we see now that capesizes especially and to a certain degree panamaxes are really , really low in earnings . '' \nAverage capesize earnings have fallen to below $ 5,000 a day this year , below operating costs estimated at $ 7,500 to $ 8,000 a day , compared with over $ 200,000 a day before the financial crisis in 2008 . \nThey reached $ 10,937 a day on Tuesday , Baltic Exchange data showed . \n`` Everyone is anticipating the freight market is going to be disappointingly low for probably 12 to 24 months , '' James Leake , managing director of ICAP Shipping Research , told the conference . \nIron ore and coal account for about two thirds of total seaborne trade of dry bulk volumes . \nSvenning said coal imports , excluding India , were down about 2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year and dropped about 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 , which `` indicates a weaker momentum in the market '' . \n`` We see that coal imports are increasing still , but the effect on total demand is relatively small . '' \nHe said iron ore imports continued to increase and had risen 12 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year , rising 6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 . \n`` The problem is the steel industry in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan -- they are all producing at very closely to capacity . \nSo they do n't need any more iron ore , so again we have to look to China . '' \nSimon Young , chief executive of COSCO UK , a unit of China 's top shipping conglomerate -LRB- 601919 . \nSS -RRB- , told the conference indications were growing that throughput at China 's ports was slowing down and iron ore imports could weaken . \n-LRB- IDn : LDE7560PK -RRB- He said the dry freight market had experienced a `` super cycle '' boom period encouraging players to expect China to have annual growth of iron ore and coal trade of over 20 percent . \n`` The booming period was so long that this made everybody believe that China would never stop , '' he said . \n`` Nobody could guarantee for every year for the next 10 years to have a 20 or 30 percent increase .

'' \nFurther north , at least 15 tanks deployed around Arida , near the border town of Tel Kelakh which troops entered on Saturday after protests erupted against Assad , and their arrival prompted dozens of families to flee into neighboring Lebanon . \nAn activists ' protest group said at least seven civilians were killed in Tel Kelakh on Sunday when troops shelled the town and sniper fire killed one civilian on Monday , raising the death toll in the army 's assault since Saturday to 12 . \nThe Syrian state news agency said five soldiers were killed in confrontations with armed groups in Tel Kalakh . \nOne resident reported intermittent shelling of Tel Kelakh and bursts of machinegun fire on Monday , but the army appeared not to have advanced beyond the outskirts . \n`` Tel Kelakh is a ghost town . \nThere are no doctors . \nSnipers are on the roof of the main hospital . \nPhones , water and electricity are cut , '' Mohammad al-Dandashi told Reuters from the town by satellite phone . \nA few families from Hilat , another border village , streamed into Lebanon on Monday as did two wounded civilians from Tel Kelakh who were seeking medical care , family members said . \nFor the past two months Syrian soldiers and police have been trying to quell demonstrations across the country calling for Assad 's overthrow . \nThey have tended to crack down on a flashpoint area for several days , using tank and rifle fire and mass arrests to subdue it , and then move on to another area . \nTroops backed by armor have now deployed in or around towns and villages across the southern Hauran plain , the central province of Homs and areas near the coast . \nSecurity forces have also tightened their grip on Damascus and its suburbs . \nThe Lebanese army said it had sent reinforcements to the border , set up checkpoints and started intensive patrols to prevent `` infiltration activities on both sides . '' \nInternational media organizations are largely banned from Syria , making it difficult to verify accounts of events there . \nAssad , who trained as an ophthalmologist , has used a mixture of repression and promises of reform to stem the protests , which were inspired by uprisings across the Arab world . \nThe United States and the European Union have imposed targeted sanctions on Syrian officials and condemned the violence used to suppress dissent . \nAuthorities said Assad intended to launch national dialogue talks , an offer rejected by opposition leaders and the main activists ' protest group , who say security forces must first stop shooting protesters and political prisoners must be freed . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe question is how long will Obama administration will give Assad , I think until we have a civil war and it 's getting close because there is so much people can take . \nSyrian people thought Turkey will not allowed the killing to happen but I think we all were wrong after all , every one looking for its own interest . \nSyrians will remember Russia & China position real well and once the regime is gone they will be gone with it ... . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

They have lost a golden and rare opportunity to do something , '' said Abdul Karim-Rihawi , head of the Human Rights League in Damascus . \n`` The protests will continue but will not grow in popularity , '' he said , adding that Assad might deploy even greater force to crush them if necessary . \nUnder the rule of Assad 's father , Hafez , Syrian forces razed the old quarter of the city of Hama in 1982 to end an uprising led by the Muslim Brotherhood . \nUp to 30,000 people were killed . \n`` If , God forbid , the regime crushes the protests then I think it will take us 50 years before we move again , '' said another Syrian activist who lives in exile . \nAnalysts say that the unrest may not topple Assad but has definitely shaken his rule . \nBouthaina Shaaban , an adviser to Assad , said earlier this week that the government had gained the upper hand over the revolt and that Assad 's rule had passed its `` dangerous moment '' . \nThe downbeat comments from some activists , which contrast with statements from others who say Assad 's use of force will only increase protesters ' determination , reflect frustration at the inability to rally the same numbers as the Egyptian uprising which toppled Hosni Mubarak , or to agree a political manifesto . \nThe opposition includes secularists , Islamists and ethnic Kurds , in exile and in Syria . \nSome seek Assad 's downfall and others want more freedoms and reform of the autocratic system . \nThat has made it difficult to unify demands on the back of protests driven more by street anger than activists ' agendas . \n`` The opposition has failed to even form a council to lead and guide the protesters . \nThis has left each city on its own and now is being crushed . \nThey finished Deraa and now Banias and Homs then will move to another one , '' the exile activist said . \nRihawi said so far no more than 200,000 Syrians had taken to the streets , from a population of 20 million . \nAs well as Assad 's use of force , some activists said fears of chaos if Assad were to be toppled and concerns that some protesters were driven by sectarian motives could have dissuaded some people from demonstrating . \n`` We are now convinced that there are Islamists working from within the protesters . \nThey are only 5 percent but they are causing damage , '' one secular activist said . \n`` We want democracy in Syria , but not a democracy to unleash sectarianism . '' \nSyrian authorities have blamed Sunni Muslim Islamist groups for the unrest , which so far has claimed the lives of more than 600 civilians and 120 soldiers and policemen . \nCiting chants by some crowds against Assad 's minority Alawite sect , as well as against Syria 's Christian community , another activist said : `` It is clear now that they have Islamist background . '' \nAlawites , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , and Christians fear their freedoms of religion would end if Sunni Islamists came to power in place of Assad 's secular Baath party . \n`` I am a Sunni , but I do not want the hardliners to rule us , '' said one of the activists , adding that some Sunni mosques had urged a `` greater Jihad '' , an Islamist rallying call . \nSyria , which opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq that toppled fellow Baathist Saddam Hussein in 2003 , turned a blind eye to Islamist militants using its land to cross into Iraq to fight U.S. forces in the years that followed the war . \nSome of these violent Islamists stayed in Syria , activists noted . \n`` My fear is that they gave the regime the motive to use force , '' one of the opposition organizers said . \nActivists said the country 's nightmare would be a split within the army , whose top commanders are mainly from the Alawite minority . \nThat could unleash sectarian tension and push the majority Sunni country into sectarian conflict similar to neighboring Lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war , or to Iraq 's turmoil . \n`` A division in the army definitely means that Syria will be divided ... because a split on a sectarian basis means each sect will be fighting for survival , '' said a rights activist in Syria . \nReports have surfaced of some low-level defections within the army , but officials and some activists dismissed it . \nAssad 's initial response to the protests included steps toward reforms , including granting citizenship to some ethnic Kurds and lifting a 48-year-old state of emergency . \nBut as demonstrations continued , he turned to the army two weeks ago to crush resistance . \n`` There are many people in the street who believe that Bashar is a reformist and now the protests are delaying him from achieving the reforms , '' Rihawi said , adding that Assad still retained popularity . \nOther activists said that even though he could deploy overwhelming force , the 45-year-old president would still have to frame a political answer to the country 's crisis : `` The security solution is not in the interest of the regime , '' one said . \n`` They have to resort to a political solution -- the result of the security solution is zero '' . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe Palestinian presidency in the West Bank city of Ramallah urged Damascus to safeguard the lives of Palestinian refugees in al-Raml camp in Latakia . \nA grassroots activist group , the Local Coordination Committees , said it had the names of at least 260 civilians , including 14 women and two infants , killed this month . \nIt said the actual toll was likely to be far higher with scant information so far from the hard-hit city of Hama , still besieged by troops and secret police . \nSyria has expelled most independent media since the unrest began , making it hard to verify reports from the country . \nTanks and navy ships shelled southern parts of Latakia on Sunday , residents and rights groups said . \nNightly anti-Assad rallies after Ramadan prayers have drawn around 20,000 people in different areas of the city , said one witness , a university student . \nThe official state news agency SANA denied Latakia had been shelled from the sea and said two police and four unidentified armed men were killed when security forces pursued `` armed men who were terrorizing residents ... and using machineguns and explosives from rooftops and from behind barricades . '' \nThe U.S. State Department said Monday it was unable to confirm that the Syrian navy had shelled Latakia . \n`` However , we are able to confirm that there is armor in the city and that there is firing on innocents again in the pattern of carnage that you have seen in other places , '' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . \nUnlike most Syrian cities , which are mainly Sunni , Latakia has a large Alawite population , partly because Assad and his father before him encouraged Alawites to move from their nearby mountain region by offering them cheap land and jobs in the public sector and security apparatus . \nLatakia port has played a key role in the Assad family 's domination of the economy , with Bashar al-Assad 's late uncle Jamil having been in virtual control of the facility , and a new generation of family members and their friends taking over . \nRights campaigners said security forces also assaulted villages in the Houla Plain north of the city of Homs Monday , raiding houses and arresting people . \nAssad replaced the governor of the northern province of Aleppo , SANA reported , after pro-democracy protests spread to the provincial capital , Syria 's main commercial hub . \n`` The minority regime is playing with fire . \nWe are coming to a point where the people in the street would rather take any weapon they can put their hand on and fight than be shot at or arrested and humiliated , '' said one activist . \n`` We are seeing civil war in Syria , but it is one-sided . \nThe hope is for street protests and international pressure to bring down the regime before it kills more Syrians and drives them to take up arms , '' he added , asking not to be named . \nRights groups say at least 12,000 have been detained during the uprising . \nThousands of political prisoners were already in jail . \nAmnesty International says it has listed 1,700 civilians killed since mid-March . \nWashington has put the toll at 2,000 . \nDamascus says 500 police and soldiers have been killed . \nThe assaults by Syrian security forces have drawn increasing condemnation from the West , Turkey and more recently from Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan . \nWashington wants Europe and China to consider sanctions on Syria 's vital oil and gas industry . \nGermany called for more European Union sanctions against Syria Monday and urged the U.N. Security Council to discuss the crackdown again this week . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAssad 's actions against his own people is much worse than Gaddafi 's Libya at the time Nato intervened there . \nWhy is no one doing anything ? \nHow can Arab nations stand by and let this happen ? \nWhy is the world not absolutely outraged at this holocaust against humanity . \nThe violence must end NOW ! \nWe the people of the planet Earth , will no longer tolerate any governments hostile and violent actions against its people . \nIt is the right of all humans on Earth , to live free and secure . \nWithout threat of violence against them by their own , or any other government . \nFrom this day forward , the people of planet Earth will band together in such ridiculous numbers so as to force rapid political action . \nWe have the ability to make any issue become a viral social networking phenomenon within hours . \nThe cameras are always on , the recorders are always running , every day we are getting closer and closer to holding governments accountable for their treatment of their peoples . \nLet the governments of the world be warned , the Arab Spring is the very beginning , the whole world is next . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` The second choice would be for us to contribute to the termination of the clashes in Syria , '' Boroujerdi said . \n`` The interests of the Muslim people command that we mobilize ourselves to support Syria as a center of Palestinian resistance . '' \nA senior cleric pressed the message home . \n`` It is the duty of all Muslims to help stabilize Syria against the destructive plots of America and Israel , '' said Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi . \nIran also used troops to put down mass protests following the disputed 2009 presidential election . \nIranian leaders also described those demonstrations as a Western plot . \nIran had hoped the Arab Spring , something Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dubbed the `` Islamic Awakening , '' would spell the end of U.S.-backed autocracies and usher in an era of Muslim unity to face-down the West and Israel . \nKhamenei used the June anniversary of the death of Iran 's revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to tell the nation : `` Our stance is clear : wherever a movement is Islamic , popular and anti-American , we support it . '' \nWithout mentioning Syria by name , he continued : `` If somewhere a movement is provoked by America and Zionists , we will not support it . \nWherever America and the Zionists enter the scene to topple a regime and occupy a country , we are on the opposite side . '' \nMohammad Marandi , an associate professor at the University of Tehran , said Iran 's support for Syria was based on a shared interest in helping resistance to Israel -- both countries support Hamas and Hezbollah -- and that continuing to back Assad while he reforms Syria 's one-party system was imperative . \n`` Iran has always believed that Syria should not be weakened , because the Israeli regime will certainly take advantage of any weakness , '' Marandi told Reuters . \n`` In any case , real reforms can only be carried out in a peaceful environment . \nThe Western and pro-Western Arab media campaign against Syria is intended to destabilize the country and to prevent Syria from implementing reforms that will keep Syria strong and an anti-Israeli government in power .

'' \nWhile civil unrest in Syria has not gone unreported in Iran , it has received far less attention than uprisings in other parts of the region , particularly Bahrain where Saudi Arabia helped a Sunni monarchy put down protests led by majority Shi'ites . \nIn recent days , as Western media , though banned from working in Syria , have reported a growing death toll , Iranian television has focused more attention on unrest in Britain that some Iranian journalists have described as a `` civil war . '' \nWith Gulf Arab countries turning against Assad , and Turkey , a bridge between the Middle East and the West , taking a tougher stance , Iranian newspapers reflect Tehran 's growing isolation . \nAfter distancing his country from Israel and moving closer to the Muslim world since coming to power in 2003 , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan surprised some in Iran with his volte face . \n`` In Syria , the state is pointing guns at its own people ... Turkey 's message to Assad is very clear : stop all kinds of violence and bloodshed . '' \nThe hardline Qods daily said Turkey , instead of showing support for Syria and Iran , had capitulated to U.S. pressure . \n`` If Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's government does not change its political behavior toward Syria , Turkey will be the main loser of the Syrian events if Damascus gets out of the current crisis , '' it wrote in a recent editorial . \nThe papers reserved their harshest words for Iran 's Gulf Arab neighbors , particularly Saudi Arabia , whose relations with the mostly non-Arab Iran have become increasingly strained in recent months . \n`` Stabbing each other 's backs has now become a custom among Arab countries , like the way they previously betrayed Palestine , Libya , Iraq and Sudan . \nThe current betrayal of Syria should come as no surprise , '' Siyasat-e Ruz daily said in an editorial . \n`` They are still under this illusion that convergence with America can help them preserve their establishment and restore their lost status in the region , '' the conservative paper said . \nThey have turned into puppets for the goals of the West . '' \nReformist daily Arman said Saudi Arabia and Bahrain appeared to be drawing the battle lines for a future regional conflict . \n`` They want to psychologically prepare the atmosphere so that if there is a conflict with Syria and Iran supports it they are standing on the opposite side and against Iran , '' Arman said . \n`` All the countries that want to settle a score with Iran would be happy if Iran entered such a conflict and then , in the name of the international community , they would harm Iran .

'' \nThe reformist daily concluded that it might soon be time for Tehran to rethink its staunch support for Assad . \n`` If the Syria situation continues then it 's time for Iran to think about its long term interests , '' it concluded , saying unconditional support for Assad might leave Iran supporting a government `` that has been thrown out of power ...

{"id": "128", "time": "2011-10-21", "text": "DUBAI | Fri Oct 21 , 2011 7:47 am EDT DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - For many Arabs , the humiliating capture and killing of Muammar Gaddafi , the longest-serving Arab leader , is a lesson to other tyrants in a region that has overthrown three long-serving rulers this year . \nBut some said on Friday that Libya would have been better off if its former leader had been given a fair trial for abuses committed during his 42-year rule , which ended when rebels captured the capital Tripoli in August . \n`` The world now has one less dictator , '' said Ziad Khalil , a Beirut shopkeeper , a day after Gaddafi 's death . \n`` This is the end he deserves . '' \nIn Cairo , Youssef Hammad , a 43-year-old business executive , said he was not surprised by Gaddafi 's gruesome demise . \n`` The way he was going to die , if caught , was sealed when he ignored his people 's calls for a more open and free society , '' Hammad said . \n`` Instead he vowed to hunt them down one by one , alleyway by alleyway , like rats . \nIronically that 's how he met his maker . '' \nGaddafi , a fugitive since August , was killed on Thursday after fighters for the National Transitional Council captured his last stronghold and hometown of Sirte . \nHe tried to flee the city in a convoy , braving NATO airstrikes . \nHis captors found him hiding in a drainage culvert , and cellphone video showed a bloodied Gaddafi being beaten . \nLibya 's Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said that Gaddafi was hit during `` crossfire '' while being taken to hospital , but most Libyans , including officials , seemed to have little doubt that he was probably killed by his captors . \nThe Egyptian cabinet said after a meeting on Thursday it was looking forward to helping the Libyan people rebuild their country . \nBut most Arab governments have yet to comment on Gaddafi 's death . \nGaddafi was the third Arab head of state to be ousted this year , after Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak . \nBut unlike Ben Ali and Mubarak , who were ousted by popular uprisings in January and February , Gaddafi was overthrown in a civil war that the new interim government says cost some 30,000 lives . \nMany Arabs said Gaddafi 's death was likely to scare Arab leaders still clinging to power in Syria and Yemen in the face of months of pro-democracy protests and crackdowns by security forces that have left thousands of people dead . \nIn the Omani capital Muscat , banker Haji Ismail said Gaddafi 's death was a lesson to other Arab rulers . \n`` They will face such a fate if they keep oppressing their people . '' \nCairo engineer Ibrahim Sabri said Arab leaders were afraid of meeting a similar fate . \n`` This was evident in the Syrian TV denial of Gaddafi 's news , they are afraid that they will share the same fate , '' he said . \nIn Syria , where President Bashar al-Assad has faced seven months of popular protests opposing his rule , video footage of a demonstration on Thursday night in Homs province showed people chanting : `` Bashar , it is your turn next ! '' \nIn the Syrian town of Houla , people carried placards saying : `` Syrian rebels congratulate the Libyan people for killing the rat Muammar Gaddafi , '' and `` Death is the fate of all oppressive rulers - first the rat Muammar Gaddafi , then the thug Bashar al-Assad . '' \nSome said the success of the Libyan uprising would have been more welcome had NATO forces not been involved . \nNATO deployed aircraft to protect Libyan civilians against Gaddafi forces in a U.N.-mandated operation . \nBut the alliance took a visible role in the fighting that ousted Gaddafi . \n`` It would have been a triumph for all Arabs if Libyans themselves removed Gaddafi without NATO help , '' said Suleiman Al Sharji , an Omani political commentator . \n`` Now we have more questions on foreign interference as versus self-rule than ever before . '' \nAmr Moussa , a former Arab League Secretary General under whom the body asked for international intervention to help Libyan civilians , said he hoped that Libya will move forward quickly to achieve the goals of its people . \n`` I hope that Libya will transition after Gaddafi 's departure into a new phase toward the path of building a modern Libya and achieving stability and real democracy , '' the independent Egyptian daily al-Tahrir newspaper quoted Amr Moussa as saying . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNot that this development is n't great news to ordinary Libyans -LRB- at least those not part of Gaddafi 's patronage system -RRB- , but the notion that the real lesson here is to treat your populations well is patently absurd . \nJust ask the King of Bahrain , the latest recipient of a boatload of US military aid so he can viciously slaughter his own people . \nFor nuanced coverage of the Libyan campaign , not just war cheerleading under the guise of promoting human rights , check out Democracy Now ! \n's archive of reports . \nI 'd recommend American style television and media as an ideal way to spread mass ignorance . \nThe Arab leaders could be afraid of NATO intervention and not of their people . \nThe rebels in Libya alone could do nothing against the Mad Dog , and they could have been eliminated in a short of time , with out the NATO help . \nGADDAFI was about to erase the city of Benghazi and its people . \nHopefully the NATO was there in the right time . \nWe hope the NATO will do the same thing with the other tyrants and dictators every where in order to stop the phenomena of ruling the countries by tyranny . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nEstimates of the size of Russia 's deposits vary widely , with local geologists putting its share of the planet 's supply at almost 30 percent , while the U.S. Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- has reported that Russia and its former Soviet neighbors hold 19 million tonnes of reserves , or about 14 percent of the total . \n`` I think Russia certainly has potential . \nIt has a number of rare earth occurrences . \nHowever , they have not been converted into reserves , '' said Colorado School of Mines professor of mineral economics Rod Eggert , explaining that the reserves are known to exist with a high degree of certainty and also commercially feasible to extract . \nGerman industry is eager to tap Russia 's resources . \nDuring a visit to Hanover in July , President Dmitry Medvedev said his country could become a key supplier to Europe 's largest economy . \nAlexander Rahr of Germany 's Council on Foreign Relations said the Federation of German Industry has since set up a research center on the issue , though no deals have been signed . \nJapanese trading house Sumitomo Corp 's Kazakh joint-venture SARECO is also considering possible projects in Yakutia , a remote autonomous republic in the Russian Far East . \nNo details were available from Sumitomo on the possible timeframe for projects in Russia as it has yet to commit to any specific developments . \nExcluding smaller quantities of rare earths produced as by-products by major miners such as Norilsk Nickel , Russia has only one active mine , Lovozersky GOK . \nIts loparite concentrate holds light rare earths such as lanthanum and cerium . \nAccording to the company 's website , it expects to mine 12,000 tonnes of concentrate this year , up from 11,000 tonnes last year . \nLovozersky ships the concentrate to the Solikamsk Magnesium Plant in the Urals , which exported 1,466 tonnes of oxides last year to U.S. Molycorp 's plant in Silmet , Estonia and Kazakhstan 's Ulba Metallurgical Plant for processing . \nThe Tomtor deposit in Yakutia is the highlight of Russia 's untapped reserves . \n`` It is a super giant , located on the territory of the Russian Federation , '' said Alexander Samonov of Russia 's Institute of Geology of Ore Deposits , Petrography , Mineralogy , and Geochemistry . \nHe said the field holds 150 million tonnes of ores with a rare earth concentration of 12 percent and large amounts of the light rare earths cerium and samarium . \nIn a recent report , analysts at Ernst & Young said experts consider concentrations above 10 percent to be very good . \nUnfortunately , the critical demand is for certain heavy rare earths used by the renewables sector in magnets , said Michael Nestour , metals and mining director at Ernst & Young . \n`` If you look at light rare earths , in 2013 there wo n't be any shortage in that market space , assuming the most advanced exploration projects start producing as planned , '' he said . \n`` And in 2016-2017 the heavy rare earth shortage ends . '' \nStill , prices for light rare earths such as lanthanum , used in petroleum-cracking catalysts and nickel metal hydride -LRB- NiMH -RRB- batteries , continue to soar . \nIn a recent Reuters interview , Silmet Chief Executive David O'Brock said lanthanum spot prices were $ 130 - $ 140 per kilogram , up from $ 35 in 2010 and $ 0.85 in 1999 . \nRussia was one of many nations that stayed out of the market because until recently prices were low and demand from makers of products such as smart phones and wind power stations had yet to boom , said Ernst & Young 's Nestour . \n`` Demand was a thimble and supply was a bucket , '' he said . \nAnalysts say that in order for Russia to increase rare earth exports , local firms would have to enter into partnerships with end-users to guarantee investment and demand . \n`` They need to link with companies manufacturing permanent magnets , windfarm companies , the automotive sector , '' Nestour said . \n`` There are also other sectors such as metallurgical alloys , defense or nuclear sectors , electric cars , low emission diodes , and there is potential in the magnetic refrigeration space . '' \nHe also said that while no detailed cost estimates had been carried out for Tomtor , a processing facility alone would cost $ 100 million to $ 300 million . \nLifton added that the cost of building the infrastructure will be considerable . \n`` I have heard very good things about Tomtor , the problem I have is that it gets to be 50-below there in winter , '' he said . \n`` Many mines in Canada get as cold as Tomtor , but they are much closer to rail and shipping links .

'' \nIn 2008 , propelled by a housing bubble , speculative buying of new debt instruments and a commodities boom , oil prices exceeded $ 100 per barrel for the first time and soared to a record high above $ 147 , helping trigger financial crisis and the worst slump since World War II . \nThis time , oil prices have soared following the loss of around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libyan oil , uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa and rapid economic growth in China , India and other developing economies . \nUsing the oil expense indicator , economists say Brent crude , the international oil benchmark , would need to be in the low $ 90s per barrel to be under the 4.5 percent danger mark . \nIn fact , Brent hit a two-and-a-half-year high of more than $ 127 per barrel in April and , with the exception of an intra-day dip Tuesday , has been over $ 100 for six months . \nEven after a fall of more than $ 20 from its early-August high on worries over a slowdown in the developed economies , Brent is still not far off $ 110 per barrel . \nOil is a key global cost because it is crucial to every part of the economy , powering manufacturing and the production of food and other commodities , fuelling transport as well as being a building block for industries such as plastics and electronics . \nIf it is too high for too long , the results are dramatic . \n`` The last two times that energy as a share of global GDP neared ... the current level , the world economy experienced severe crises : the double dip recession of the 1980s and the Great Recession of 2008 , '' Merrill Lynch analysts led by Francisco Blanch said in a note to clients . \nEconomists reinforce their warnings over the possibility of an impending slowdown with data showing that oil demand has begun to shrink in some countries in response to high prices . \nOil data lags , but the latest U.S. figures , for May , show a drop of 4.7 percent year-on-year in U.S. gasoline demand . \nDeutsche Bank analyst Adam Sieminski says he is concerned by a trend towards lower U.S. oil demand evident since last summer : `` The last time U.S. oil demand was falling was in 2007 and early 2008 , '' Sieminski said in a note written with analyst Michael Lewis . \n`` This was a leading indicator of the economic troubles that would hit the U.S. in the middle of 2008 . '' \nAnalysts differ on exactly how high oil prices need to be and how long they need to stay up before they slow growth . \nSome economists argue the impact of oil prices has been exaggerated , and others note that not all recessions are caused by oil , such as slowdowns in the early 1990s and again a decade later . \nBut most economists argue there is a level at which fuel input costs become incompatible with continuing economic growth . \nJames Zhang , an analyst at Standard Bank , says the danger level comes with the oil expense indicator at around 5 percent : `` $ 100 per barrel represents about 5 percent for the ` oil expense indicator ' , which we think would be a threshold on an annual average level to potentially kill off global growth , '' he said . \n`` Absent any shocks , I do n't believe an oil price , say in the range of $ 100 to $ 130 , will necessary bring a recession itself , but a slower growth is almost ensured -- another sharp jump in oil prices could act as a shock , '' Zhang said . \nBarret said record high oil and commodity prices were putting unsustainable pressure on household expenditure , and while he like other economists is reluctant to predict recession , he thinks the warnings should be heeded : `` There is still a chance that oil prices will go down very significantly , and that could be a strong support to the economy . \nBut if prices stay near $ 110 per barrel until the end of the year , we will have a major problem by the start of 2012 , '' he said . \n`` We either get sharply lower prices or a recession that will bring down prices . \nEither way , oil prices must come down .

'' \n`` There are measures that have been taken and activated in this regard so that the Syrian government ends its aggression against its people , but these do not include any sanctions that could hurt the Syrian people , '' Davutoglu said after talks in Amman with King Abdullah and senior Jordanian officials . \nTurkish officials who spoke on condition of anonymity say the sanctions , which were announced last month without details , will affect military , banking and energy ties , among others . \nThe United States and the European Union have already imposed sanctions on Syria 's small , but key , oil sector , which is linked to the Assad family and their friends . \nIn the million-strong city of Homs , a hotbed of opposition to Assad , residents and activists said a general strike kept most workers at home and shops shut . \nOne resident said armed opponents of Assad had enforced the strike . \nFiring by soldiers , which killed 11 people across Syria on Wednesday , also kept people indoors . \nIn the town of Hamrat , north of Homs , suspected army deserters killed nine soldiers in an attack on a bus with a rocket-propelled grenade , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . \nIt was the latest incident in an armed insurgency emerging alongside the campaign of street protests . \n`` This will end with the fall of the regime . \nIt is nearly unavoidable , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . \n`` But unfortunately it could take time because the situation is complex , because there is a risk of civil war between Syrian factions , because surrounding Arab countries do not want us to intervene , '' he told French radio . \nIn Umayyad Square in central Damascus , tens of thousands of people gathered for what has become a weekly show of support for Assad organized by authorities . \nState television showed them waving Syrian flags and portraits of the president , saying they were rallying under the slogan `` Long live the homeland and its leader . '' \nThe rally took place before the envoys from six Arab nations arrived in Damascus for talks with Assad following a call on October 16 for the opposition and government to hold a dialogue within 15 days at the League headquarters in Cairo . \n`` What is hoped is that the violence will end , a dialogue will start and reforms will be achieved , '' Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby said . \nThe delegation was led by Qatar and included Egypt , Algeria , Oman , Sudan and Yemen . \nAssad 's government says it is serious about political reform , and that militants are trying to wreck it . \nThe opposition says Assad has no intention of relaxing his grip on power , pointing to an increase in killings , torture , arrests and assassinations . \nHuman Rights Watch said the Arab mission should demand that Syria allow in independent civilian monitors . \n`` The only way to make sure civilians are protected is to have on-the-ground monitors whose presence would inhibit abuse by the security services , '' HRW Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said . \nAssad is from the minority Alawite sect in a mostly Sunni Muslim country . \nSensitive to the reverberations if he were to fall , leaders of mostly Sunni nations across the Middle East have been cautious about criticizing him or taking action , as many struggle to deal with their own unrest . \nIn Homs , residents said public employees took part in the strike for the first time , and only a few food shops were open . \nVideo posted on the Internet showed shuttered shops on both sides of a main street in the nearby region of Houla . \nIn Deraa the impact was reportedly even greater . \n`` There is total closure . \nThe streets of Deraa are empty , even the few butcher 's shops and pharmacies that were open are now closed , '' said Jasem Masalmeh , a resident of the provincial capital . \nSyria has excluded most foreign media , making it difficult to verify accounts from activists and authorities . \n"}

Security Council resolution condemning violence against protesters . \n`` It 's true that in New York -LRB- at the United Nations -RRB- we were blocked , and that is a stain on the Security Council , which said almost nothing about this barbaric repression , '' Juppe said on France Inter radio . \n`` This will end with the fall of the regime , it is nearly unavoidable , but unfortunately it could take time because the situation is complex , because there is a risk of civil war between Syrian factions , because surrounding Arab countries do not want us to intervene . '' \nAssad , who says his government is serious about political reform , will meet an Arab League committee in Damascus on Wednesday . \nThe six-nation committee includes Algeria , Oman , Sudan and Yemen -- countries seen as sympathetic to Syria . \nJuppe said that while most Arab nations opposed action against Syria , Turkey was moving closer to the Western position and had begun to exert pressure on the Syrian government to stop the crackdown . \nAfter months of clashes between protesters and security forces , which have killed 3,000 people , according to a U.N. estimate , Syrian army deserters have formed the beginnings of an armed insurgency against the state . \nOpposition abroad to the Syrian government has begun to coalesce under the Syrian National Transition Council . \nFrance has stopped short of recognizing the body , but signaled its support earlier this month when Juppe shook hands with its leader in Paris . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOct 26 , 2011 8:07 am EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nOfficials with Libya 's National Transitional Council told Reuters earlier in the week that monitoring of satellite calls and other intelligence indicated Saif al-Islam was considering turning himself in to The Hague , and trying to arrange an aircraft to get him there and out of reach of NTC fighters , in whose hands Muammar Gaddafi was beaten and killed a week ago . \nHowever , surrender is only one option . \nThe Gaddafis made friends with desert tribes in Niger , Mali and other poor former French colonies in West Africa , as well as farther afield in countries like Zimbabwe and Sudan , some of them also recipients of largesse during the 42-year rule of Colonel Gaddafi , a self-styled son of the desert and African `` king of kings '' . \nFrance , a key backer of Febuary 's revolt , reminded Africans of obligations to hand over the surviving ICC indictees - former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam : `` We do n't care whether he goes on foot , by plane , by boat , by car or on a camel , the only thing that matters is that he belongs in the ICC , '' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero . \n`` We do n't have many details , but the sooner the better . '' \nDespite reduced circumstances since his father 's overthrow in August , the younger Gaddafi , whom some have described as a playboy in his days at the London School of Economics , may have access to portable wealth in the form of bundles of banknotes and gold bars , as well as to secret , unfrozen foreign accounts . \nNiger , Mali , Chad and Burkina Faso , a swathe of arid states to the south of Libya , are all signatories to the treaty that set up the ICC , established to give a permanent international tribunal for crimes against humanity after ad hoc bodies set up for Rwanda , the former Yugoslavia and Sierra Leone . \n`` If we reach agreement , logistical measures for his transfer will be taken , '' ICC spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said . \n`` There are different scenarios , depending on what country he is in . '' \nWithout its own police force , the ICC depends on cooperation from member states -- which do not include world powers the United States , Russia and China . \nIts focus so far on Sudanese , Congolese and Kenyans has left some Africans disgruntled . \nPowers on the continent like South Africa and Nigeria are signatories . \nBut Algeria , which took in Saif al-Islam 's mother , sister , brother Hannibal and half-brother Mohammed , is not . \nNor are Sudan , Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe and a number of other nations where leaders might see advantage in giving him a haven . \nAs well as enjoying protection from Tuareg allies who traditionally provided close security for the Gaddafis , Saif al-Islam may still be in the company of mercenaries from elsewhere in Africa , including possibly South Africa , NTC officials say . \nA South African newspaper , in an unconfirmed report , said South African mercenaries were working to fly him out . \nLiving conditions in the desert are spartan , though the autumn climate is relatively temperate . \nSmugglers and others who make a living in the desert travel in 4x4s and trucks , watching fuel gauges closely , as well as by horse and camel , resting in tents as well as simple shacks scattered close to oases . \nCommunications are provided by satellite phones powered by car engines and generators , but also networks of nomads . \nA bodyguard who saw Saif al-Islam as he fled last week from one of the Gaddafi clan 's last bastions near the capital told Reuters that Saif al-Islam , eldest son of Gaddafi 's second wife Safia , seemed `` nervous '' and `` confused '' . \nHe escaped even though his motorcade was hit by a NATO air strike as it left Bani Walid on October 19 , the day before his father died at Sirte . \nThree of Saif al-Islam 's brothers were killed in the war . \nAnother , Saadi , has found refuge in Niger . \nThe arrest or surrender of Saif al-Islam would bring a new prominence for the nine-year-old ICC , whose highest profile suspect to date is Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir , who remains defiantly in office , defended by many fellow Africans . \nFollowing the killing of Muammar Gaddafi , most probably at the hands of the fighters who filmed themselves battering and abusing him , Western allies of Libya 's new leaders had urged them to impose respect for human rights , even for those accused of scorning the rights of others down the decades . \nNTC leaders would like to run their own trials , but acknowledge that their writ barely runs in the deep south . \nTheir NATO allies , now winding up a mission that backed the revolt , have expressed little enthusiasm for hunting a few individuals across a vast tract of empty continent -- though French troops based in West Africa might be the best placed to step in with transport if Gaddafi did choose to surrender . \nRichard Dicker of the New York-based Human Rights Watch said the killing of his father made it all the more important that Saif al-Islam end up on trial in the Netherlands : `` The gruesome killing of Muammar Gaddafi last week underscores the urgency of ensuring that his son , Saif al-Islam , be promptly handed over to the International Criminal Court for fair trial in The Hague , '' Dicker said . \n`` This will best ensure that justice is done . '' \nThe ICC 's Moreno-Ocampo said in his statement : `` If he surrenders to the ICC , he has the right to be heard in court , he is innocent until proven guilty . \nThe judges will decide . \n`` If the judges decide that Saif is innocent , or has served his sentence , he can request the judges to send him to a different country as long as that country accepts him . '' \nSaif al-Islam was once seen as a liberal reformer , architect of a rapprochement with the oil-thirsty Western states on whom his father waged proxy guerrilla wars for decades . \nBut he ran into opposition from hardliners among his brothers and had taken a lower profile before bursting back onto the world 's television screens with belligerent win-or-die rhetoric after the revolt . \nThe ICC accuses him of hiring mercenaries to carry out a plan , worked out with his father and Senussi , to kill unarmed protesters inspired by Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere . \nHowever , even if arrested on charges relating to his role in attacks on protesters in February and March , Saif al-Islam could make defense arguments that might limit any sentence , lawyers said -- possibly a tempting alternative to death in Libya . \nFor now , some of the few tens of thousands of people who eke out a living in the deepest Sahara , a borderless expanse roamed by smugglers and nomadic herders , say there would be a welcome for the younger Gaddafi , who in better times exhibited paintings he said were inspired by his love for the desert landscapes . \n`` We are ready to hide him wherever needed , '' said Mouddour Barka , a resident of Agadez in northern Niger . \n`` We are telling the international community to stay out of this business and our own authorities not to hand him over -- otherwise we are ready to go out onto the streets and they will have us to deal with . '' \nNiger 's government in the capital Niamey has vowed to meet its ICC commitments . \nBut 750 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- north in a region where cross-border allegiances among Tuareg nomads often outweigh national ties , the picture looks different . \n`` I am ready to welcome him in . \nFor me his case is quite simply a humanitarian one , '' said Mohamed Anako , president of Agadez region , itself the size of France . \n`` Libya and Niger are brother countries and cousins ... so we will welcome him in . '' \nLibya 's southern neighbors accepted Muammar Gaddafi 's largesse despite exasperation at his vision of a trans-Saharan people , which prompted concern over their territorial integrity . \nFor northern communities in both Niger and Mali , the NATO-backed Libyan war that removed him has brought nothing but trouble , with thousands of African migrant workers and armed Tuaregs who fought for Gaddafi turning up at their door . \n"}

'' \nThe U.S. has supported many brutal tyrants : Saddam Hussein , Augusto Pinochet , Hosni Mubarak , Doc Chevalier , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos , Suharto , and Somoza just to name a few . \nSupporting Gaddafi falls into the category of normal U.S. geopolitics . \nAmericans having been willing , decade after decade , to vote for leaders who have supported brutal dictators around the world . \nWhere then is the conflict with American values ? \nAmerican values seem to include supporting dictators around the world whenever various geopolitical goals are at stake . \n`` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' \nBush brought Gaddafi back into the international fold because Gaddafi renounced nuclear weapons . \nYou think that 's insignificant ? \nNATO is a big reason for the bloodshed in Libya today . \nTalk to the current president if you have a problem with that . \nAnd by the way , Gaddafi only dreamed of and talked about perpetrating the kind of violence against demonstrators that Syria 's Assad is actually doing . \nI do n't see America doing much about that , other than finger wagging . \nAlthough Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . \nIn the late 90 ? \nThe Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . \nThe whole Iraq war\\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . \nFor the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . \nI believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . \nAnd with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . \nGeorge Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? \ns. That is the last time I can remember a Republican running anything like a sane , coherent foreign policy . \nAlthough Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . \nIn the late 90 ? \nThe Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . \nThe whole Iraq war\\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . \nFor the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . \nI believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . \nAnd with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . \nGeorge Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? \ns.

'' \nI think it started more because of economic woes . \nRegarding Gaddafi renouncing nuclear weapons as being significant ... it was , and no dictator will ever do that again after what we just did . \nThe Bush Administration was an institution without morals . \nStill , its legacy is vested in the Tea Party revolutionary movement of today . \nI presume the London School of Economics is mourning Gadaffi 's fall from power . \nIf ever there was an fine example of lefties consorting with dictators -LRB- as the right correctly argues -RRB- LSE 's ` friendship ' with Gaddafi must be it . \nSo much for standing up for the people . \nThe left is all about grabbing power in any shape or form . \nNothing for nothing , but I think you need to go back to your research and check on something ... `` acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . \nPresident Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . \nWhile I think this is a little sensationalist to say that Americans were the primary targets in these attacks , these were attacks specifically against Israel and Israelis targeting El Al airlines ticket counters in Italy and Austria by Abu Nadil as retaliation against Israel for Operation Wooden Leg , where Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis -LRB- 10\\/85 -RRB- . \nThis had nothing to do with an attack on American children at all . \nI would suffice to say that if Americans were killed as additional damage , that Abu Nadil would n't have minded , however , that was not their main goal . \nAll too reminiscent of our early ties with Saddam Hussein . \nWe armed him to the teeth to be a counterweight to Iran and to guarantee the stability of Gulf oil . \nAnd then he began to feel invincible . \nWe all know how that ended . \nKeep an eye an Saudi Arabia . \nWe might see something similar happen there in the years to come . \nThanks for explaining so much . \nMs. Clinton continued the tradition of Gaddafi-coddling by a stubborn reluctance to support the rebels . \nObama was finally shamed into doing some air support for rebels when France and Britain took the leadership . \nThe Nato bombing started much too late . \nWhen Nato started air strikes , Gaddafi 's long exposed armored columns were now in the cities terrorizing citizens and the opportunity to wipe them out quickly was gone . \nWithout a doubt Oil is always an issue for the US in the ME . \nThe next issue is the welfare of Israel , still he only country actually eating another territory\\/country alive . \nBut the US has only itself to blame for its dependence on oil -- wherever the source . \nIt had spent the last 50 plus years building urban areas enslaved by the automakers . \nMost of the oil it uses is for transportation and home heating costs . \nit also uses more than any other country on a daily for auto use alone . \nthe last note got sent accidentally . \nThe problem is -- there is no fix for suburban sprawl . \nIt 's too diffuse and too expensive to service with adequate alternative transportation and many of the old rail lines are gone and their ROW 's are being eaten by encroachment by abutters or put to alternate uses like bicycle and hiking paths . \nThe sprawl itself usually kills off any local agriculture so the urban areas ca n't feed themselves at all without trucking everything from thousands of miles away . \nI look at Google earth to view urban areas world wide and very few of them -- even the gigantic areas like Sao Paolo , Or Beijing and even most European Cities look they are still being constructed around rail lines or other public transportation systems . \nLarge areas of Japan have become continuous city . \nBut they have 180 million people I recall . \nThe radiating valleys in the Kyoto area are continuous strips of farmsteads that all front on the common roads . \nIt must be easy to run regular bus lines along any of them to the nearest located rail lines . \nAs the country ages , it will become more difficult for seniors to have to live without public transportation . \nNursing home life is a miserable and very expensive way to die . \nAnd owning a car is becoming more expensive . \nThis country has made walking for daily errands or taking a bus or train impractical for any but inner city commuters residents . \nThe private automobile is one of the factors behind the trillions spent in foreign wars . \nThe biggest public transportation subsidies are being eaten by the automakers and it is the most inefficient way to move people . \nAnd all of the above to be held hostage by the cost of gas . \nVery stupid and not at all worth it . \nThere 's a mistake in the last paragraph . \nI meant to write `` that European cities look like they are being constructed around public transportation lines '' In other words : most of the world had more sense . \nAnd I want to add , that for decades European countries put a very high tax on gasoline . \nI do n't know for sure , but I think most countries except the ME , have taxed gasoline heavily . \nIf analysts totaled all the costs of extensive road and highway networks , purchase price and repair bills , gasoline costs , taxes and insurance costs , prison time and lost productivity for DUI and other auto related legal issues , a system that is so ubiquitous it is n't possible in most suburban areas to walk to a convenient store to get a few groceries , and then the costs of fighting in expensive conflicts that masquerade as `` freedom fighting '' to ensure that it can control in same way the costs of oil , the automobile is probably the single biggest waste of money and time ever invented . \nPaintcan -- took a while -- but -- spot on !! seems our society neve gets

{"id": "174", "time": "2011-04-27", "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Apr 27 , 2011 10:19 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , who had boasted his country was immune to the unrest lashing the Arab world 's autocrats , is now fighting for political survival . \nThe 45-year-old leader has tried economic carrots , political concessions and brute force to try to quell a popular upheaval that rights groups say has cost over 450 lives in six weeks . \nSyria , mired in its gravest crisis since Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in 1982 , risks international opprobrium and sanctions for its repressive response . \nThe Assad family 's grip on power looks at its shakiest in 30 years . \nInstability in Syria , fulcrum of several Middle Eastern conflicts , carries huge but as yet uncertain implications for its neighbors , notably Lebanon and Israel , and for the region . \nHere are some of the key risks to watch . \nWhat sparked the revolt was the arrest of 15 youngsters for scrawling anti-government slogans in the southern town of Deraa , where the first three deaths occurred on March 18 . \nProtests gradually spread across Syria as people demanded freedom from three decades of Baath Party rule , against a background of grievances over economic hardship and corruption . \nAssad , portraying unrest as the work of armed gangs paid by malign powers , replaced his government and coughed up a series of concessions that did not mollify protesters increasingly enraged by the bloodshed inflicted by security forces . \nTheir initial chants for reform soon gave way to the battle cry of Arab uprisings that had already unseated the rulers of Egypt and Tunisia : `` The people want the downfall of the regime . '' \nOn April 21 Assad ended 48 years of emergency law and scrapped a hated state security court , but the killing of 100 protesters the next day seemed to make these moves a mockery . \nSimilarly , limited prisoner releases were counterbalanced by the detention of hundreds of other dissenters and protesters . \nEconomic handouts and job creation promises failed to calm the resentment of many Syrians who believe only a small group of crony capitalists has benefited from Assad 's reforms , ostensibly aimed at overhauling an inefficient socialist-style economy . \nSo far the armed forces and security services , many of whose commanders belong to Assad 's family and his minority Alawite community , appear to have remained loyal -- unlike in Egypt and Tunisia where the military helped usher presidents from power . \nAssad 's ousting is no foregone conclusion . \nHis opponents may have breached the barrier of fear that has long underpinned Baathist rule , but ruthless repression could re-erect it . \nThe president can also play the `` me-or-chaos '' card which resonates with many Syrians . \nSome fear that militant Islamists could fill any power vacuum , others that civil war might engulf their country , as in next-door Lebanon and Iraq in the past . \n-- Any signs of mutiny among the army and security forces -- Any signs of protesters taking up arms The United States has condemned Assad 's use of force -- he sent army tanks into Deraa and two suburbs of Damascus on April 25 -- but Western nations which launched air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi 's Libya have not acted against the Syrian leader . \nThe Arab League , which swiftly suspended Libya 's membership over Gaddafi 's efforts to quell opposition , has remained silent on Syria , although it issued a blanket condemnation on April 26 of the use of force against pro-democracy Arab protesters . \nWestern criticism of Assad 's crackdown was initially muted , partly because of fears that a collapse of his minority Alawite rule might lead to sectarian conflict with the Sunni majority or bring to power Islamist militants hostile to Israel . \nThe United States , which had sought to isolate Syria after the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri , has more recently attempted to engage it , hoping to loosen its alliance with Iran and move it toward a peace deal with Israel . \nNeither policy proved very successful . \nIsrael is in two minds . \nThe removal of Assad , a foe who is allied with Iran and backs Lebanon 's Hezbollah and Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad , would seem a bonus . \nYet Assad and his father have kept the border mostly quiet since the 1973 war , even though Israel still occupies Syria 's Golan Heights . \nNo country has much leverage over Syria . \nEven Turkey , which has developed close links with Damascus in the last few years , has seen Assad ignore its advice to enact reforms . \nThe United States has kept sanctions on Syria since 2004 . \nIts European allies may now impose travel bans or asset freezes on the Syrian leadership . \nAny move for U.N. sanctions is likely to be opposed by veto-wielding Russia , an old ally of Syria . \nIran could be a big loser if Assad 's rule collapses because Syria , its main Arab ally since 1980 , has facilitated Tehran 's efforts to build a Middle Eastern `` axis of resistance '' to Israel and the United States via Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . \nLebanon , Iraq and other countries will worry that any ethnic or sectarian conflict in a destabilized Syria could spill across their borders , fuelling regional tensions between Arabs and Kurds , Christians and Muslims , or Sunnis and Shi'ites . \n\\* Any Arab League position on Syria The turmoil will hit an economy grappling with unemployment , poverty , and water and power shortages , along with falling oil output and rapid population growth of 2.5 percent a year . \nThe International Monetary Fund said on April 27 Syria was set for 3 percent growth in 2011 versus 3.2 percent in 2010 , with inflation reaching 6 percent against 4.4 percent last year and the fiscal deficit widening to 6.8 percent of GDP from 4.8 . \nThe unrest has ravaged the tourism industry , one of Syria 's fastest-growing sectors , and may scare off foreign investors -- Syria has delayed bidding for its third mobile operator license , Saudi Telecom , one of the bidders , said on April 27 . \nA government goal of luring more than $ 40 billion in private investment to overhaul creaking infrastructure and create jobs over five years had looked implausible even before the protests , given corruption levels and uncertainty about the rule of law . \nForeign direct investment fell to $ 1.4 billion in 2009 from $ 2.4 billion in 2008 , according to the World Bank . \nSyria , now a net oil importer , needs to invest in refineries to cut fuel import costs in a country that produces 380,000 barrels per day of crude , down from a 590,000 bpd peak in 1996 . \nDespite fiscal strains , Syria has opened the spending taps to try to calm discontent , cutting taxes on some foods , giving cash to poor families , reducing income tax , raising the minimum wage and extending health cover to civil service pensioners -- measures the IMF says will cost about 2 percent of GDP . \nUnemployment is officially 10 percent . \nIndependent estimates say it is closer to 25 percent . \nThe International Labor Organization says 60 percent of those aged 15 to 24 lack jobs . \nTougher international sanctions would inflict more economic pain -- without necessarily swaying Syrian policy-makers . \nU.S. sanctions bar the export of certain goods with over 10 percent of U.S.-produced components , restrict dealings with the Commercial Bank of Syria and ban the U.S. financial system from dealing with individuals linked to militant groups . \nAny punitive measures by the European Union , which accounted for 36 percent of Syria 's exports and

'' \nFor security reasons many Lebanese analysts declined to comment or be quoted by name for this article . \nUnderlining the tension , a little known Sunni militant group staged an anti-Assad demonstration in Lebanon 's northern city of Tripoli on Friday and chanted demands for an Islamic caliphate . \nSome analysts said Hezbollah might tighten its already strong grip on Lebanon 's political fortunes if it felt that its main ally in Damascus was weakening . \nA cosmopolitan Mediterranean country with 18 sects , Lebanon endured a 15-year civil war characterized by ethnic and sectarian bloodletting between Muslims and Christians . \nThe war ended in 1990 but many Lebanese felt justice was not served and many households still keep guns to hand , including AK-47 assault rifles and even rocket-propelled grenades . \n`` There is already plenty of tension in Lebanon and the Syria unrest will complicate relations in Lebanon , especially between the -LRB- Sunni -RRB- Future Movement led by Hariri and Hezbollah , '' a political science professor at a Lebanese university said . \nSyrian authorities , trying to crush five weeks of protests against Assad 's authoritarian rule , have accused a Lebanese lawmaker from Hariri 's bloc of stirring up the demonstrators and providing them with weapons to attack security forces . \nLegislator Jamal al-Jarrah denied this . \nBut , in a sign of the hairtrigger tension , pro-Syria Lebanese and Palestinian parties held a news conference immediately after the Syrian accusations and denounced what they called `` foreign interference in Syria . '' \nSome accused Hariri himself of being behind the demonstrations . \n`` Lebanon is stable when Syria is stable . \nThere is no security in Lebanon without security in Syria , '' Hezbollah lawmaker Nawaf al-Mussawi said at the conference . \nNabih Berri , the parliament speaker and head of Lebanon 's Shi'ite Amal group , a Hezbollah ally and very close to Syria , said on Tuesday Lebanese had to `` care for Syria 's security and stability more than the Syrians themselves .

{"id": "135", "time": "2011-04-27", "text": "BEIRUT | Wed Apr 27 , 2011 10:32 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - From Israel to Iran , Syria 's neighbors are starting to contemplate the possibility of a future without the Assad family as Lords of Damascus , and , whether friends or foes , some do n't like what they see . \nIndeed , some are in denial about what they are witnessing . \nHezbollah , the Lebanese Shi'ite movement widely seen as an Iranian proxy in the Middle East , purports to believe the government of President Bashar al-Assad is putting down an insurrection by armed gangs of Salafi or Sunni Muslim fanatics . \nIn its report of the Syrian army 's assault on the southern city of Deraa , epicenter of the revolt which began last month , Al Manar , Hezbollah 's television , stuck to the official version that the army responded to citizens ' pleas to put an end to `` killings and terrorizing operations by extremist groups . '' \nHezbollah greeted with glee uprisings that overthrew dictatorships in Tunisia and Egypt and championed the rights of Bahraini protesters against Saudi military intervention to quash Shi'ite demonstrations . \nBut it is distinctly unenthusiastic about the risk of losing the support of a Syrian government which is not only its main protector but the conduit for arms supplies from Iran . \nTehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , has called the revolt in Syria `` a Zionist plot . '' \nYet Israel too seems deeply uneasy about any change in the status quo . \nAlthough they are still formally at war , Syria under the current president and his late father , Hafez al-Assad , has maintained a stable border with the Jewish state since 1973 even though Israel still occupies the Golan Heights . \nIsrael 's fear -- voiced more openly by commentators plugged in to its security establishment than by politicians -- is that a successful uprising might replace firm Baath party rule with a more radical government , or one less able or willing to keep radical forces on a leash . \nAlthough Assad sponsors Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , he has played a cautious hand . \nBehind the strident Arabist rhetoric and ties with Tehran he has kept the option of peace with Israel in play and sought acceptance by Western powers . \n`` The implications are enormous and totally unpredictable , '' said Lebanon-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri . \n`` What makes Syria distinctive is that the regime and the system have close structural links with every conflict or player in the region : Hezbollah , Hamas , Iran , Lebanon , Israel , America , Iraq , Turkey . \nIn all these -LRB- cases -RRB- there is a Syrian link . '' \nDemonstrations have spread across the country and grown in intensity , he said , and protesters who began calling for reform of the system were now demanding `` the overthrow of the regime . '' \nAt the back of many minds is the experience of Iraq , plunged into years of chaos and sectarian savagery after the US-led invasion in 2003 and removal of Saddam Hussein . \n`` Everybody in the region is concerned about the destabilization of Syria , even those who do n't like Assad , because there is one thing he brings to the region : a certain kind of predictability and stability , '' Khouri said . \n`` He maintained the truce along the Syrian-Israeli border , people know how his government behaves . \nNobody knows what will happen afterwards . '' \nAlex Fishman , a military affairs journalist for Israel 's best-selling daily Yedioth Ahronoth , summed up Israeli apprehension after the Syrian army stormed into Deraa . \n`` However odd it may sound , the Israeli establishment has a certain sentiment for the Assad family . \nThey kept their promises throughout the years and even talked about an arrangement with Israel on their terms , '' he wrote . \n`` It 's hard to part with a comfortable old slipper , but the top members of the political and security establishment believe that the Syrian regime , in its current format , will change within weeks or months , '' Fishman said . \nHe added : `` The sole interest guiding Israel 's conduct is : if what is happening in Syria will ultimately weaken the Damascus-Iran-Hezbollah axis -- we 'll come out ahead . '' \nFor Hezbollah and Iran , losing Assad would certainly be a big blow . \n`` If it -LRB- Syria -RRB- splits into mini-satellite states that will be bad news for everybody , '' Khouri said , suggesting that as in Iraq this might provide an opening for al Qaeda militants . \nAcross the border in Lebanon , arena of a sectarian civil war in 1975-90 that sucked in regional and world powers and left Syria in control for 29 years , people are also worried . \nAny prospect of a new sharpening of tensions between Sunnis and Shi'ites , Arabs and Kurds , or Christians and Muslims , all simmering across the region after being brought to the boil by Iraq , produces shudders . \n`` I do n't think any wise man is not worried about what happens in Syria because it is a neighbor , '' said Talal Salman , editor of Beirut 's daily as-Safir . \n`` Any earthquake in Syria will shake Lebanon with its fragile make-up . \nSyria 's stability is in our interest . '' \nFor now , Assad has decided to follow in the footsteps of his father and resort to military force , not reform , to put down the protests at a cost so far of more than 400 lives , according to human rights groups . \nMonday 's deployment of tanks in Deraa looks like an indicator of what is to come . \nA source close to the Syrian military said Assad and his security establishment had taken a decision to wage war on protesters across the country . \nBut Ali al-Atassi , a prominent Syrian activist whose father was a former president jailed for 22 years by the elder Assad , said `` another Hama '' was impossible . \nIn 1982 , Hafez al-Assad sent in the army to crush an armed lslamist uprising , killing of up to 30,000 people . \n`` Syria has reached a turning point . \nIt can not go back to where it was , '' said Atassi . \nHe said the Western habit of accommodating dictatorships in return for stability was no longer valid . \n`` In Tunis , Egypt and elsewhere for years , Arab leaders and the West gave the Arab people a binary choice : stability or chaos ; despotism or Islamism . \n`` After what happened in Tunis and Egypt , we discovered that there is a third option which is the democratic way . \nSure , the Islamists will play a role in it , but they will not have the leading role , '' Atassi said . \nWhile many analysts argue that life after Assad would be hazardous or that he may prove impossible to remove , others say a relatively smooth transition is imaginable over time because Damascus has institutions that can shoulder responsibility . \nThey include the army , whose backbone is Sunni although key posts are controlled by members of Assad 's Alawite minority . \nWhat most observers now dismiss is the possibility of reforms substantial enough to meet popular demands . \nEven if Assad wanted to enact wide-scale reforms , they argue , he lacks the power to prevail over entrenched interests in the security forces and military intelligence . \n`` He is the prisoner of a certain structure and at the same time part of it , '' Atassi said . \n`` The next 2-3 weeks are really critical . \nThey will determine whether he will remain in power or whether his regime will collapse , '' Khouri told Reuters . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe reluctance to shed ` stability ' will be widespread , as the internet-savvy Arab youth persists with its demand for a fair say in government , whether under the more obviously despotic regimes or unelected regimes which are currently supporting some of the revolutions against other unelected regimes ! \nHowever , youth is owed its say , as it has its whole life ahead of it . \nI guess that Hazballah has lost its popularity among syrians as resistance movement after describing protesters as infiltrators and conspirators . \nWhen it comes to Israel , I guess that the next political system in Syria will be truely against israel and will work to get back its occupied land . \nAnd syria will get back to its normal arab circle but will keep good relations with Iran in order to work as a mediator between Iran and the arab nations but if a conflict arose , it will for sure take the side of the arabs . \nGovernments such as Syria and Iran will never fall . \nThey have the military on their side and decades of experience in putting down peoples opposition by para military troops whom are trained just for this scenario . \nAs long as they are willing to kill and kidnap their own people they will be in play forever . \nSyria and Iran are no Egypt , the military fears the paramilitaries such as Basij in Iran and the Basij fears the Qods army and so forth ...

{"id": "84", "time": "2011-04-11", "text": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist . \nThe opinions expressed are her own . \nLONDON -- Syria 's crackdown will stamp on its economic dream . \nBashar al-Assad 's regime had an ambitious plan to quadruple foreign investment and boost tourism in order to drive growth in a poor country with dwindling oil . \nBut the violent suppression of protestors will scare off both investors and tourists . \nWhen George W. Bush was U.S. president , Syria was brought into an expanded `` axis of evil '' , which included countries like Iran . \nBut until last month , Assad was having some success in normalising relations with the West . \nThe United States recently appointed its first ambassador to the country in years . \nAssad jetted around Western capitals , portraying Syria as on the path to modernisation . \nThere was even a glossy profile earlier this year of his photogenic wife in American Vogue . \nAgainst that backdrop , Syria 's plans to improve infrastructure by attracting foreign direct investment worth $ 55 billion by 2015 -- roughly equivalent to its entire annual GDP -- looked plausible , even though current FDI is around just $ 2.5 billion a year . \nThe same was true of Syria 's five-year goal to capitalize on its rich history by boosting tourism a further 40 percent to reach over 12 million visitors a year . \nIndeed , tourist numbers were up 40 percent last year alone . \nThis would have helped Syria achieve its growth target of 5 percent to 6 percent a year over the next five years . \nWhile that 's not much faster than in previous years , it would have offset the steady decline in oil related revenues , currently around 5 percent of GDP , and problems in agriculture -- an even bigger pillar of the economy which , in a good year , accounts for as much as one quarter of GDP . \nBut the escalating violence in Syria has left the country 's economic plans looking more like a fantasy . \nWhile over 70 percent of visitors to Syria come from the Arab region -- a chunk of tourism that may not be so easily frightened away -- it was from Europe that Syria hoped to attract the bulk of new big-spending tourists . \nEqually , it was from the West that Syria aimed to bring in new investment . \nEvery bullet fired makes that less likely . \nJust goes to show that you can not hope to develop and sustain a open economy without the inevitable social revolution . \nWhats going on in Syria is ahead of the game and hopefully in the long run it will benefit the people there . \nAlso , How will Israel and Lebanon respond to any new form of government in Syria ? \nI could see freedom fighters streaming into Syria and an itchy Israel fearing that any new state may take on a more extremist position . \nWe have to remember that Syria 's borders are just lines on a map . \nI 'm hoping for a more peaceful outcome , but that is very unlikely because the west let Egypt 's Mubarak go to jail when he should have been rewarded for letting democracy win . \nThere is no incentive for any other abusive dictators to step down voluntarily . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe company was founded in 1999 as Breakingviews.com and was acquired by Thomson Reuters in 2009 , becoming Reuters brand for financial commentary . \nEvery day , we comment on the big financial stories as they break . \nOur expert analysis is provided by a global team of 30 correspondents based in New York , Washington , London , Hong Kong , Madrid , Dubai and Mumbai . \nFor the full commentary and analysis service from breakingviews.com , including regular emails containing the latest views , contact sales@breakingviews.com . \nBreakingviews has published a selection of books for purchase and download . \n"}

Ford Library\\/Handout LOS ANGELES | Sat Jul 9 , 2011 8:00 am BST LOS ANGELES -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Betty Ford , the wife of the late President Gerald Ford , who overcame alcohol and prescription drug addictions and helped found a rehabilitation clinic that bears her name , died on Friday at the age of 93 . \n`` I was deeply saddened this afternoon when I heard of Betty Ford 's death , '' another former first lady , Nancy Reagan , said in a statement confirming Ford 's death . \nFord once was dubbed the `` fighting first lady '' by Time magazine because of her outspoken political views , which often differed from those of her husband 's Republican Party . \nShe strongly supported women 's rights while her husband was president from 1974 to 1977 , working the phones in a vain attempt to get states to pass the Equal Rights Amendment , which sought to give women and men equality under law . \nFord 's candor was surprising for the time . \nShe took a tolerant stance on abortion and admitted without shame that some of her children had tried marijuana . \nNor was she alarmed by the prospect of her daughter having premarital sex . \nFord also was an early campaigner against breast cancer . \nShe underwent a mastectomy in 1974 , less than two months after her husband succeeded the disgraced Richard Nixon as president . \nHer frank discussions about her disease helped raise awareness about breast cancer and she eventually took the same approach towards her alcoholism , which she battled even as first lady . \nFord 's problems with chemical dependency may have begun in 1964 , when doctors prescribed her painkillers for a pinched nerve . \nShe developed an addiction to prescription drugs and also became dependent on alcohol during the 1960s . \nThe Betty Ford Centre in California came into being in 1982 after Ford was treated for her addictions at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Long Beach , and saw the need for treatment that emphasized the special needs of women . \n`` She has been an inspiration to so many through her efforts to educate women about breast cancer and her wonderful work at the Betty Ford Centre , '' Nancy Reagan , the wife of the late President Ronald Reagan , said in the statement . \n`` She was Jerry Ford 's strength through some very difficult days in our country 's history and I admired her courage in facing and sharing her personal struggles with all of us . '' \nPRAISE FROM OBAMA , GEORGE W. BUSH President Barack Obama praised Ford 's courage and compassion . \n`` As our nation 's first lady , she was a powerful advocate for women 's health and women 's rights , '' he said in a statement . \n`` After leaving the White House , Mrs. Ford helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction and inspired thousands to seek much-needed treatment . '' \nFormer President George W. Bush described her as a valued friend who `` made countless contributions to our country . '' \nFord remained an active chairman of the center 's board of directors for decades and also worked to help handicapped children , the arts and the fights against AIDS and arthritis . \nFor most of her adult life , Ford was best known as the wife of Rep. Gerald Ford , a Michigan Republican , and the mother of four children . \nThe couple had planned to retire from Congress in 1973 when Nixon , already under fire in the Watergate scandal , chose Ford to serve as vice president after the resignation of Spiro Agnew . \nFord became president after Nixon resigned on August 9 , 1974 , but he was defeated when he ran for the presidency in 1976 by Democrat Jimmy Carter . \nBetty delivered her husband 's concession speech because he had lost his voice on the campaign trail . \nBorn April 8 , 1918 , in Chicago , Elizabeth Bloomer was raised in Grand Rapids , Michigan . \nShe wanted to be a dancer and studied under Martha Graham and modelled in New York before returning to Grand Rapids and marrying a furniture salesman . \nThey divorced after five years and she married Ford in 1948 . \nIn her later years , Betty Ford slipped from the public eye but returned when her husband of 58 years died in 2006 . \nHer stately demeanor in time of grief brought her to the attention of a whole new generation that possibly knew her name only from the famous clinic . \n-LRB- Reporting by Bob Tourtellotte and Deborah Zabarenko ; Editing by Christopher Wilson and Bill Trott -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Security Council sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and several other top officials , council diplomats told Reuters on Monday . \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , diplomats said the resolution 's drafters -- the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Portugal -- included several Syrian firms that they hoped to blacklist and urged referring Syria 's clampdown on protests to the permanent war-crimes tribunal in The Hague . \nTypically , U.N. sanctions against individuals include an international travel ban and mandatory freezing of any financial assets . \nSanctioned companies face an asset freeze and it becomes illegal for any firm to do business with them . \nA senior Western diplomat hinted last week that the proposed sanctions could include an arms embargo . \nMoscow might have trouble with that because Russia is a long-standing arms supplier for Damascus . \n`` There are four names of individuals and two or three entities -LRB- firms -RRB- , '' a diplomat familiar with negotiations said . \nThe five Western powers hoped to circulate a draft to the other 10 council members . \nOnce it reaches the full 15-nation council , there will be further negotiations and the text will likely be revised . \nAnother diplomat confirmed the envoy 's remarks . \nThe United Nations ' human rights chief , Navi Pillay , last week recommended the Security Council refer Syria 's crackdown to the International Criminal Court in The Hague , saying the government may have been guilty of war crimes . \nDiplomats said the draft would call for an ICC referral . \nRUSSIA , CHINA RELUCTANT TO SANCTION SYRIA The ICC issued arrest warrants for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and his intelligence chief in June after the council referred Libya 's crackdown on pro-democracy protests to the court in February . \nIt is unclear whether the rebels plan to hand over any of the detained suspects . \nRussia and China traditionally oppose the use of sanctions against any U.N. member state and have worked hard for months to prevent the Security Council from imposing punitive measures on Damascus . \nRussia has long had close ties to Syria and its top arms exporter has vowed to continue supplying it with weapons . \nBut Western diplomats said Moscow and Beijing -- as well as Brazil , India and South Africa -- might be persuaded that the time has come to take action against Assad . \nThe Syrian leader has ignored an August 3 demand by the Security Council to end the use of military force against civilian protesters . \nSyrian forces shot dead three people in the city of Homs during a visit by a U.N. humanitarian team on Monday , activists said , and the United Nations said the civilian death toll from President Bashar al-Assad 's crackdown on anti-government protests has reached 2,200 since March . \nRussia , China , South Africa , Brazil and India have warned against escalating the standoff with Syria into a Libyan-style foreign military intervention against the government of Assad , who Washington and the European Union have said should step down . \nThe Russians , South Africans and Indians have urged dialogue with Damascus and said that Assad needs time to implement promised reforms . \nSecurity Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the permanent council members for approval . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nHussein and other opposition activists said however the events in Tripoli would revive Syrian protesters ' hopes . \n`` What happened in Libya means a lot for us , it means that the Arab spring is coming without doubt ... there is no solution to any problem without the will of the people , '' said Michel Kilo , a prominent opposition figure . \nNo country has proposed the kind of action in Syria which NATO forces have carried out in Libya . \nBut the West has called on Assad to step down and Washington has imposed new sanctions over his crackdown , in which the United Nations says 2,200 civilians have died . \nSyria has an alliance with Iran and a key role in Lebanon , despite ending a 29-year military presence there in 2005 . \nIt also has influence in Iraq and supports militant groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah . \nAssad on Sunday said Syria would not bow to external pressure , which he said could only affect `` a president made in the United States and a subservient people who get their orders from outside . '' \n`` As for the threat of a military action ... any action against Syria will have greater consequences -LRB- on those who carry it out -RRB- , greater than they can tolerate , '' he said . \nAssad has responded to the unrest with a mixture of reforms and force . \nHe granted citizenship to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds , ended a state of emergency and promised to let groups other than his Baath party run in elections . \nAnalysts and opposition figures said they expected the situation in Syria to deteriorate further , with authorities intensifying the crackdown and protesters not backing down . \n`` After what happened in Libya I think he -LRB- Assad -RRB- will be tougher with the security option he is taking , '' Boumonsef said . \n`` He sees what -LRB- he calls -RRB- the international conspiracy on him will be stronger and now that Gaddafi is out of the way it will move toward him in full strength ... This is imminent . '' \nSome opposition figures expressed fears that Libya 's endgame might encourage voices among the opposition calling for the arming of a hitherto largely peaceful movement in Syria . \n`` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said Hussein , who was detained during the uprising . \n`` But we will resist such proposals , regardless of where they are coming from . '' \nThe anti-Assad movement is fragmented . \n`` Despite everything that is happening , the opposition remains stuck over little issues like personal issues between its leaders , '' Kilo said . \nBoumonsef said it would try harder , with international help , to unify . \n`` The opposition will be motivated more . \nThere is no return and -LRB- Assad 's -RRB- reforms will not stop anything . \nIt is too late . '' \nEncouraged after Western leaders called on Assad to step down , Syrian opposition figures are holding talks in Istanbul to nominate a broad-based council that could aid in a transition of power if Assad is toppled . \nUnlike previous opposition conferences , which were marked by divisions between Islamists and liberals , participants said there was broad agreement on 120 nominees for the council from inside and outside Syria . \nThe council would speak for dissidents in exile and activists on the ground , opposition figures told Reuters . \nBut some poured cold water on the idea . \n`` There is no interest inside Syria in a conference happening outside because the public opinion and those inside Syria believe that what is happening outside is marginal , '' Kilo said . \n`` We do not need a transitional council ... the real challenge is not what should be done after the regime collapses but for us it is what should be done every day so that we remain standing .

I was concerned that a long period of above-target inflation might dislodge medium-term expectations of future inflation and find their way into other prices and wages , '' he added . \n`` That has n't happened and , as I say , the outlook for growth domestically as well as globally has weakened in the last three or four months , so I would describe myself now as much more in the middle of the debate . '' \nBroadbent said the MPC 's assumption was that there had been a permanent loss of output in Britain and appeared to hint at a scenario in which more quantitative easing would be considered . \n`` I still believe there 's significant spare capacity in the economy , and that means that interest rates are low , '' he said . \n`` If that outlook changed in a way which would lower the prospects for inflation over the medium term , maybe more could be done . '' \nThe Bank last week inched closer to launching a second round of quantitative easing after two policymakers unexpectedly dropped their call for higher interest rates . \nOnly long-standing dove Adam Posen called for more QE this month but other policymakers considered it . \nThe Bank has held rates at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009 and purchased 200 billion pounds of financial assets , mostly gilts , with newly-created money between then and January 2010 . \n-LRB- Reporting by Keith Weir and Olesya Dmitracova ; editing by Stephen Nisbet -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nRobertson added the government wanted to see the stadium re-open in 2014 , while West Ham were quick to express their desire to still become tenants at the venue which has cost around 500 million pounds to build . \nIf West Ham were to win the bid again , any rental agreement is likely to save the club money compared to the original plan , which is likely to be welcome news for the outfit who were relegated from the Premier League last season . \nThe 35 million pound cost of transforming the stadium after the Olympics is already budgeted for within the 9.3 billion pound public sector funding package for the Games . \nIt will be downsized from its 80,000 Olympic capacity . \n`` I believe it will ... put us in the place where we always intended to be -- delivering a lasting sustainable legacy for the stadium backed up by a robust but flexible business plan that provides a very good return to the taxpayer , '' London mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement . \nWest Ham were selected to inherit the stadium , the centrepiece of the July 27-August 12 Games , in February before Tottenham Hotspur sought a judicial review saying a 40 million pounds loan from Newham Council gave West Ham an unfair economic advantage and made the decision unlawful . \nTottenham had been given a three-week ultimatum to accept a 17 million pounds package to stay in north London and drop the legal battle over the future of the stadium , which is in east London and nearer to West Ham 's current Upton Park home . \nSpurs , who have alternative plans for a new ground close to their White Hart Lane stadium , backed the OPLC decision but gave no clues as to whether they would join the race to rent . \n`` We firmly believe that the bid we put forward was , in fact , a realistic sporting solution for the stadium , along with a substantial return to the taxpayer , community programming and athletics provision , '' they said on their website -LRB- www.tottenhamhotspur.com -RRB- . \nA joint statement by the West Ham vice chairman Karren Brady and Kim Bromley-Derry , chief executive of the London Borough of Newham , also welcomed decision and was more clear-cut about future plans . \n`` West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham will aim to help deliver the legacy , '' it said . \nKeeping the stadium in public ownership is likely to safeguard the athletics track , which was one of the key legacy promises London gave when bidding for the 2012 Games . \nThe track , which was laid earlier this month , is also vital to the capital 's bid to host the 2017 athletics world championships and the legal row with Spurs had threatened its existence given Tottenham are not in favor of keeping it . \nUK Athletics chairman Ed Warner said the government and OPLC had taken a `` bold , decisive move . '' \n`` I 'm absolutely delighted , '' he told Sky Sports News . \n`` It guarantees we are going to get this athletics stadium open , up and running , in the summer of 2014 and capable of hosting a world championships which is what we 've been after all along . '' \nAthletics world governing body the IAAF visited London last week to assess the 2017 bid in the wake of the Spurs row . \nQatar 's capital Doha is also bidding for the championships . \nAnother London football club , Leyton Orient , had also been part of a stadium legal challenge . \nThe third-tier side , also based near the venue in east London , feared they could lose fans and said Tuesday 's decision vindicated their actions . \n`` Today is a fabulous day for Leyton Orient fans , it puts the whole thing back in the public domain , '' Orient chairman Barry Hearn said . \n`` Now they have to go back to the beginning and start again and we will be an interested party in that bidding process , '' he added without specifying in what capacity , admitting his club would be `` lost '' in a 60,000-seater stadium . \n"}

'' \nTurkey has allowed opponents of Assad to meet in Turkish cities since anti-Assad protests started in March and has also given sanctuary to the most senior Syrian military to defect . \nDavutoglu 's talks followed one of the highest daily death tolls in Homs , the central Syrian city that has seen some of the most extensive protests against Assad . \nResidents said Syrian forces backed by tanks killed at least 25 people in a thrust into the opposition hotbed , 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north of Damascus , aimed at stemming growing armed resistance to Assad 's crackdown on the seven-month-old uprising . \nTanks firing machineguns swept into Sunni districts of Bab Sbaa , Bab Dreib and Bab Amro where large protests demanding the removal of Assad have taken place , residents and activists said . \nArmy deserters and armed residents hit back with rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- , hitting several tanks , they said . \nHoms is close to the border with Lebanon , which has begun to serve as a supply line to insurgents in the city and surrounding countryside , including army defectors who have increased in numbers since the crackdown intensified two months ago . \nTuesday , troops sealed off districts in the city and searched the countryside for army defectors , residents said . \n`` Bab Sbaa , Bab Amro , al-Khalidya and al-Baiyada are totally sealed and machinegun fire keeps being directed at these neighborhoods . \nThe only area where there are no troops or ` shabbiha ' is downtown , where only a few people are on the streets and there are virtually no cars , '' a resident of the city , who gave his name as Wael , told Reuters . \n`` Martyrs will be buried today , so we are expecting more deaths . \nA good number of the casualties yesterday occurred at funerals , '' another resident said . \nThe United Nations says Assad 's crackdown has killed 3,000 people across Syria since March including at least 187 children . \nSyrian authorities blame the unrest on `` armed terrorist groups '' which they say have killed 1,100 army and police and are operating in Homs , killing civilians and prominent figures . \nThe official news agency said troops had arrested `` the head of one of the leading terrorist groups '' in Homs and confiscated weapons , including RPGs and gunpowder . \nForeign reporters are largely banned from Syria , making independent confirmation of reported events difficult . \nMindful of the threat of civil war in Syria , which straddles major fault lines of Middle East conflict , the Arab League offered Sunday to host talks in Cairo between the opposition , who have formed a National Council , and the Damascus leadership . \nBut Syria 's representative to the League said Syria had major reservations about the offer , while the Syrian National Council said it could not engage in talks while Assad 's military continued to storm restive cities and towns . \n"}

There will be more discoveries . '' \nHowever , mining industry executives warn it will take years to build up gold output as only about three mining firms have started production -- the rest are still exploring . \nThe government predicts gold output will reach as much as 70 tonnes this year and bring in $ 3 billion of revenue , potentially making Sudan the third largest gold producer in Africa , after South Africa and Ghana and before Mali . \nBut the executives say that goal is well out of reach for now . \n`` I think if they make 20 to 30 percent of the $ 3 billion , that would be good , '' said a managing director of a Sudanese mining firm , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . \nThe official target is `` way too optimistic '' . \nEven the mining ministry admits that only 7 tonnes will be produced from mines such as Hassai ; the rest is projected to come from `` artisanal '' seekers like Mohamed , whose success is hard to track . \nA foreign mining expert working in Sudan said 4 tonnes of gold from mines would be a realistic target for 2011 . \nAnother obstacle is the U.S. trade embargo , which deters many Western firms from getting involved , leaving the field mainly to local or Chinese companies which may lack experience . \n`` It 's a bit of a hit and miss business with Sudanese firms . \nChinese firms are good at building mines but poor explorers , '' said a Western expert in exploration . \nAlso , few of the small entrepreneurs are selling their gold to the central bank ; much of their output ends up with traders who smuggle it to Dubai or other major gold markets . \nAs a result , Sudan made only $ 1.1 billion from gold exports in 2010 . \nThis year might see a modest increase due to a higher gold price , but revenues will be way below $ 3 billion , experts say . \nThe government is offering incentives to persuade unofficial seekers to sell their gold to the central bank , and plans to establish a refinery to enhance the value of gold products . \n`` You have to intervene to regulate the sector , '' said Abdelbagi Gailani , the minister of minerals . \nDespite the problems , Sudan 's gold output is likely to rise continuously over the next few years , experts say . \nBarrie estimated annual production could increase by a further 2.8 tonnes every three or four years as new mines came on stream . \nMeanwhile , a `` significant profit '' from the unofficial output would eventually end up in government coffers if regulation improved . \nBarrie said the gold rush had helped make the northeast one of the most stable regions in a country hit by insurgencies such as the rebellion in Darfur . \n`` We have benefited a lot from the gold mine . \nThe company built a health center , which you rarely find here , '' said Mohammed Mahmoud , another resident of Bir Ajam . \nUnder an expansion plan , the Hassai mine will build a pipeline from the Nile to obtain more water which engineers will use to drill deeper . \nAs a byproduct , villages on the way will be connected to the pipeline . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn Sabha , the biggest town in southern Libya , organisers said 250,000 people representing most of the tribes of the south turned out to show support for Gaddafi . \nBritain , one of the main backers of the campaign against Gaddafi , predicted that `` the writing is on the wall '' for the Libyan leader . \n`` I think it 's heading towards a clear conclusion -- eventually , we do n't know when that will be , when Colonel Gaddafi realizes that his departure is essential to the future of Libya and its people , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague told Reuters in an interview on Friday . \n`` I think the pressure on the regime is increasing all the time . \nWe have intensified the military campaign , it will be intensified further . \nThe economic pressure is intensifying also , and so is the diplomatic pressure , '' he said during a visit to Addis Ababa . \nIn what may be the latest financial squeeze on Gaddafi , Turkey has frozen $ 1 billion of Libyan central bank reserves deposited in its banks , a Turkish newspaper reported on Friday . \n"}

{"id": "201", "time": "2011-04-28", "text": "LONDON | Thu Apr 28 , 2011 12:30 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Wholesale UK gas prices should fall this summer as liquefied natural gas shipments rapidly replenish plentiful stocks , helping soften the blow of record high transport fuel prices for battered British business . \nAfter an unprecedented surge in gas costs last summer , Britain 's gas market should return to its normal mid-year price lull , offering some short-term relief to big industrial users who buy on the wholesale market in an economy barely staggering out of recession . \nWholesale gas prices in Britain -- a benchmark for global gas sales -- surged in mid-March on fears that leading liquefied natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- buyer Japan would need more fuel to make up for nuclear plants shut by the March 11 tsunami . \nBut fears of a resulting diminished supply to Europe have not been realized , and shipments from two huge new Qatari LNG plants , which together can produce 15.6 million tonnes a year -LRB- mtpa -RRB- , have already swollen UK gas stocks to more than double the levels seen last year . \nAnd despite a deal to sell Japan an extra 4 million tonnes of LNG from the new plants , Europe is still likely to get more LNG this summer than last , some analysts say . \n`` They can send 4 million tonnes to Japan and still send more to Europe , '' leading independent LNG consultant Andrew Flower said , adding Japan 's deal would probably only reduce the flood of Qatari LNG that would have otherwise have landed in Europe . \nInfluential U.S.-based investment bank Goldman Sachs sparked a rally in UK gas prices this week when it said UK gas prices were likely to rise significantly in 2011 and 2012 due to reduced gas supply from Libya and Japan 's newfound gas needs . \nBut other analysts say there should be plenty to spare . \n`` We project that Europe will import 6.18 million metric tons in May , a year-over-year increase of 0.52 million tonnes or 9.1 percent , '' Waterborne LNG analysts said in their latest European LNG outlook . \n`` That will be driven primarily by the ramp-up of Qatari volumes into the UK . '' \nThe U.S.-based LNG specialists revised up their EU import forecasts following surprisingly high imports in the weeks since the tsunami and now expect European imports for April to be 20 percent above the year-ago level . \nAlthough there appear to be fewer tankers heading for northwest Europe than the long line of vessels queuing up in late March , a steady stream of deliveries continues . \nGas prices usually wilt in English summers when heating demand is low , and stocking-up for the next winter is one of the few price supports . \nIn 2010 , a shutdown for maintenance of about half of Qatar 's LNG production trains provoked an unprecedented summer surge in prices on Europe 's biggest gas market . \nQatari exporters plan some maintenance this year , but last summer 's rally seems unlikely to be repeated , because Qatar has since increased production capacity by 25 percent , of which Japan bought only a quarter last week . \nUK gas prices for fuel delivered the next month surged about 15 percent from March 10 to March 16 , when front-month contracts hit a 26-month high of 65.95 pence per therm -LRB- $ 10.85 per mmbtu -RRB- . \nPrices have since fallen in a deluge of LNG from mostly Qatar and many other suppliers seeking to benefit from the UK price surge . \nBut prices for gas delivered in the UK market next month are still about 80 percent higher than a year ago and nearly double levels two years ago . \nPrices should fall as supply exceeds demand . \nSociete Generale said in an April 19 report that UK gas prices were `` much too high , '' pointing to weak demand , plentiful spare export capacity in Russia and few LNG diversions to Japan . \nThanks also to a mild end to winter , Britain 's biggest gas storage site has about 85 percent more gas than a year ago , while stocks at recently expanded LNG terminals are near record highs . \nSo there is a lot less space to stash excess fuel over the next few months , unless it can be re-exported to Belgium via a pipeline , which has already been pumping record volumes this year as European buyers gobble up cheap gas . \n`` With summer round the corner , I believe prices should fall further , '' senior SocGen gas and LNG analyst Thierry Bros said on Tuesday , after UK gas prices fell about 5 percent in the week since the bank published its latest European gas price outlook . \nSocGen says that producers would have to slash production to maintain gas prices above 50 pence per therm -LRB- $ 8.29 per mmbtu -RRB- over the summer , and the French bank doubts they would dare behave like a cartel for fear that European politicians turn away from an increasingly gas-reliant energy strategy . \nAnalysts ' estimates of the additional gas Japan will need this year vary from 5 bcm to nearly 15 bcm . \nLibya had exported about 10 bcm of gas a year to Italy and Spain before civil war shut its exports down in February . \nBy comparison with these numbers , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- forecast in November that the global oversupply of gas was set to rise above 200 billion cubic metres -LRB- bcm -RRB- in 2011 -- largely because of a boom in North American shale gas production that has left many LNG sellers including Qatar scrambling for new buyers . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "29", "time": "2011-04-28", "text": "LONDON | Thu Apr 28 , 2011 11:01 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Crowds camped out in London and foreign dignitaries flew in from around the world for Friday 's wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton , a service full of pomp and ceremony that has thrust the monarchy to center stage . \nUnderlying the diplomatic minefield of an event taking place in the full glare of the world 's media , Britain withdrew Syria 's invitation , saying Syria 's crackdown on calls for democracy made it inappropriate that its ambassador should attend . \nMiddleton , 29 , accompanied by William 's younger brother and best man Prince Harry , attended a rehearsal on Thursday at the wedding venue , Westminster Abbey , the coronation church for the monarchy since William the Conqueror in 1066 . \nIn the evening , Prince William reached into the crowds waiting on the Mall , the ceremonial avenue running from Buckingham Palace , shaking hands and telling delighted members of the public he was focusing on `` remembering the lines '' for the `` big day , '' a live BBC broadcast showed . \nIn a message of thanks to well-wishers worldwide , the couple said they were deeply touched by the outpouring of affection ahead of a wedding service that will combine ancient traditions of the monarchy with a sense of modernity to reflect the times . \nIn the service , Middleton will not promise to `` obey '' William as part of her wedding vows in front of a congregation gathering royals , politicians , celebrities and friends . \n`` We are both so delighted that you are able to join us in celebrating what we hope will be one of the happiest days of our lives , '' William , second in line to the throne , and Kate wrote in a statement printed in an official souvenir program . \nOn the street across from the abbey , crowds began to swell at a makeshift campsite , with tents draped in British `` Union Jack '' flags , pictures of the couple and banners reading `` It 's cold but worth it '' and `` It could have been me . '' \n`` I 'm a romance novelist so I had to come for the most romantic event in the world , '' said Sheree Zielke , 55 , who came from Canada to watch the event -- which is being met by republicans with indifference and by royalists with excitement . \nCindy Sagar , from Oxford in central England , said she had been one of about 600,000 who watched the 1981 wedding of William 's father Prince Charles to Princess Diana . \n`` It was electric , it was one of the best days of my life . '' \nTourism chiefs predict an extra 600,000 visitors will be in the capital on Friday , taking the total to about 1.1 million and bringing in up to 50 million pounds -LRB- $ 80 million -RRB- . \nSecurity will be tight , as Britain is on its second highest threat level meaning an attack by militants is considered `` highly likely , '' and police have carried out thorough searches along the route . \nMilitant Islamists and Irish republicans , anarchists , and stalkers are all seen by security experts as possible threats . \nAcross London , flags and red , white and blue bunting fluttered across buildings and shops , with similar scenes in cities , towns and villages across the country . \nPrime Minister David Cameron said Britons `` felt deeply '' about the constitutional monarchy , which went through scandals in the 1990s -- notably William 's parents ' divorce -- and has described the nuptials as `` unadulterated good news . '' \nSome Britons , however , are indifferent or hostile as the wedding comes at a time when government austerity measures are leading to deep spending cuts and large-scale job losses . \nWhile the royal family and the Middletons will pay for the ceremony and reception , the taxpayers will foot the bill for security costs , which republicans say could exceed 10 million pounds . \nAn Ipsos MORI poll for Reuters this month found 47 percent of Britons were not very , or not at all , interested . \n`` I want to get as far away as possible from the wedding because it really does n't mean anything to me , so my wife and I are going for a long weekend to Italy , '' Londoner Alex Joseph told Reuters . \nArtist Ollie Sam , 26 , commented : `` It makes me laugh that many people here are leaving town to get away for the long weekend , while foreigners are coming to see the wedding . \nI personally think it 's a waste of money . '' \nThe government estimates about two million people will join 5,500 street parties in England and Wales , though officials said the affluent south seemed more royalist than the poorer north . \nEconomists say the extra public holiday will cost billions of pounds and could damage Britain 's fragile economic recovery , one saying it will knock a quarter of a percentage point off second-quarter GDP growth . \nAbroad , the world 's fascination with the British royal family is undiminished . \nAn estimated 8,000 journalists have arrived in London to cover the ceremony , and hundreds of millions across the world will watch on television . \nThat interest stems partly from the lasting appeal of William 's mother Diana , particularly in the United States . \nFourteen years ago , the world 's gaze was upon William and Westminster Abbey for Diana 's funeral after her death in a Paris car crash , and William and Kate want her to be remembered on Friday . \nThey have included the final hymn sung at her funeral among their choices ; Diana 's friend Elton John , who sang `` Candle in the Wind '' at her funeral , will be a wedding guest ; and William gave Kate her dazzling sapphire and diamond engagement ring . \nWilliam , now 28 , was 15 when his hugely popular mother died and the image of the prince and his brother Harry walking behind their mother 's funeral cortege was striking . \nWhile Diana 's death marked a low point for senior royals -- their cool reaction in sharp contrast to a huge outpouring of public grief -- they hope William 's wedding will ignite enthusiasm and modernize the monarchy 's image . \nKate , from an affluent middle-class background , is seen as adding a dash of glamour , reportedly winning William 's attention by appearing at a charity fashion show in little more than her underwear . \nDiana 's death and other scandals saw support for the House of Windsor dive in the 1990s but their approval ratings are now much improved . \nThree-quarters of those polled for Reuters last week said they favored Britain remaining a monarchy . \nThe revival of the family fortunes meant there was little opposition when Charles married his long-term lover Camilla in 2005 , a marriage thought inconceivable less than a decade earlier because of Diana 's public standing . \nKate , whose parents run a successful business and whose mother 's ancestors were miners , will be the first commoner to marry a monarch-to-be since Anne Hyde wed the future James II in the 17th century . \n`` Their marriage will breathe new life into the monarchy as the queen enters the twilight of her reign , bringing new blood and a fresh perspective to an institution that faces criticism for being elitist and out of touch , '' royal biographer Claudia Joseph told Reuters . \n"}

However , a condemnation of Syrian actions by the U.

With the help of God , we will embark on freedom , '' a comment on a Facebook page run by activists said . \nEmergency rule has been used since Assad 's Baath Party seized power to justify arbitrary arrests and detention and a ban on all opposition . \nAssad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , and are usually followed by an intense crackdown . \nThe authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . \nWestern and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . \nSyria is technically at war with Israel but has kept its Golan Heights front with the Jewish state quiet since a 1974 ceasefire . \nIt has long borders with Iraq , and supports the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Shi'ite Hezbollah movement in neighboring Lebanon , also backed by Iran . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOn the other hand Cuba have seen democracy in the horizon for more than 40 years and figure out that it is just something in the horizon anyhow . \nThe smorgasbord is to small even if you would taste the communism . \nThe problem in Syria is not really the Emergency Law or other similar repressive laws on the books . \nOver the past 50 years of the Assad family dictatorship the pervasive state security apparatus has grown so entrenched and autonomous that it heeds no laws . \nThe feared mukhabarat , as the shadowy state security services are known in Syria , never think of law and order when they kidnap , torture , or disappear freedom activists . \nThe only way for the Assad regime is to disband the 15 + state security agencies it created over the decades and hand the power back to a new reformed judicial system , the first step in a transition of power to a democratically elected civilian government . \nThis would certainly mean the end of the Assad family rule of Syria and end to the monopoly on power by the small Allawite minority . \nIt would be very courageous of Bashar Al Assad to take such action and would save him and his children , but many of his relatives and close associates will be brought to justice over their past human rights abuses , especially the genocide in the city of Hama in 1982 . \nWithout this Syria is heading toward a vicious civil war in which the biggest losers will be the Alawites themselves . \nIt is in this minority 's best interest to negotiate a peaceful and orderly exit from power with the least bloodshed . \nThe Alawites need to be told by the international community that it is now 25 years after the fall of the Soviet Union , their protector , and that there are officials and ex-officials amongst them that are unsavable under international law for their bloody pasts . \nThe minority and its future should not be sacrificed for them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAuthorities have banned most international media from operating in Syria since the outbreak of the protests in March , making it difficult to verify reports from activists and authorities . \nState television said gunmen had fired on security forces in Homs in several other towns , wounding two of them . \nIn the old Homs district of Bab Sbaa , a witness said several armored vehicles deployed and soldiers fired at protesters from road blocks set up in main streets in the city of one million . \nAnother activist in Homs said troops surrounded a private hospital in Bab Sbaa and several wounded people rushed to another hospital on the outskirts of the city where security forces were not present . \nASSAD `` RUNNING OUT OF TIME '' Protesters have taken to the streets for 14 weeks to protest against Assad in unrest which has claimed the lives of around 1,300 civilians , with security forces arresting over 12,000 people and shooting security personnel who refused to fire on civilians , according to rights groups . \nAuthorities say 500 police and soldiers have been killed by gunmen they also blame for most of the civilian deaths . \nAlongside the military crackdown , Assad has promised a national dialogue on political reforms . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was `` disheartened '' by reports of continued violence near the Syrian border with Turkey . \nMonday 's meeting in Damascus , she said , was not enough on its own to address demands for reform . \n`` It is absolutely clear that the Syrian government is running out of time , '' she said during a visit to Lithuania . \n`` They are either going to allow a serious political process that will include peaceful protests to take place throughout Syria and engage in a productive dialogue with members of the opposition and civil society , or they 're going to continue to see increasingly organized resistance . '' \nAround 100 people crossed over into Lebanon early on Friday , witnesses said . \nThousands have fled to Lebanon during the three months of unrest , but many have returned and it is unclear how many remain in Lebanon . \nSyrian television showed a pro-Assad demonstration of around 100 people in the northern city of Aleppo on Friday , and state media reported several other large gatherings organized by the authorities on Thursday which they said expressed support for Assad 's proposed reforms . \nThe United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Assad and his top officials in response to the violent repression of the protests . \nOn Wednesday the U.S. Treasury Department said it was also imposing sanctions against Syria 's security forces for human rights abuses and against Iran for supporting them . \nThe Treasury named the four major branches of Syria 's security forces and said any assets they may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen and that Americans are barred from any dealings with them . \nDamascus and Tehran both deny Western accusations that Iran has supported the crackdown on Syrian protesters . \n"}

{"id": "19", "time": "2011-04-19", "text": "BEIRUT | Tue Apr 19 , 2011 6:25 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , facing the gravest challenge of his 11 years in power , has tried repression , economic handouts and promises of reform to quell an unprecedented month-long wave of popular protests . \nYet the unrest , which rights groups say has cost more than 200 lives , including 17 on Monday , shows no sign of abating . \nAssad and his father before him have ruled Syria under a tough emergency law in force since 1963 , bolstered by the Baath party , the military and an array of fearsome security agencies . \nWhile the Syrians demanding freedom seem far from dislodging Assad , no Arab ruler can feel secure in a region electrified by the swift fall of autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia this year . \nThe Assads , whose country sits on the fault lines of many Middle Eastern conflicts , have pursued relatively predictable external policies . \nAny political change in Syria would be a big deal for its friends and foes alike in a volatile region . \nFollowing are some scenarios of what could happen in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : \\* ASSAD KEEPS POWER , ENACTS REFORM Conceivably , the Syrian president may decide to bend with the wind and implement far-reaching reform . \nLast week he promised to replace emergency law and appointed a new cabinet . \nBut protesters will want proof the 45-year-old leader can make a real break with the past . \nPreviously he has resisted political reform . \nHis attempts to modernize a socialist-style economy have failed to create enough jobs or alleviate hardship . \nAssad 's problem is that dismantling the apparatus of repression , enshrining the rule of law to defeat corruption or allowing new parties to challenge his Baath party would remove the props of his power with no guarantees of political survival . \nSuch a high-risk course could regain popular support for Assad , but he would have to undermine his own entourage and ditch the authoritarian template used since his formidable father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970 . \n\\* PROTEST MOVEMENT IS CRUSHED Nearly 30 years ago , the elder Assad ruthlessly put down an armed Islamist uprising , killing thousands of people in the city of Hama in military operations cloaked from international view . \nThat degree of violence would be harder to get away with today , when Syrians , despite state curbs on media , can use their mobile phone cameras to post footage of protests on YouTube . \nNevertheless , the Interior Ministry now says Syria is facing an armed insurrection by Salafi Muslims . \nSecurity forces led by Assad relatives and allies have shown few qualms in detaining dissidents or using batons , bullets and tear gas on protesters . \nHanging tough seems the likeliest default option for an embattled Assad as he seeks to rally support from his own minority Alawite community , sections of the Sunni majority and many other Syrians with a stake in the status quo . \n\\* ASSAD QUITS OR IS OVERTHROWN Barely thinkable just a few weeks ago , regime change remains a long shot , although the persistence of protests despite bloody crackdowns has shortened the odds that Assad might buckle . \nWhat might come next -- a peaceful transition of power , a military coup , prolonged instability or civil war -- is anyone 's guess . \nThe 2003 removal of Saddam Hussein , the Arab world 's only other Baathist ruler , plunged Iraq into years of violent chaos . \nSunni-majority Syria , dominated under the Baathists by its 10 percent Alawite minority , has other ethnic-sectarian divides , with restive Kurds as well as Druze and Christian communities . \nAnti-Assad demonstrators have stressed national unity rather than narrower identities -- and many have called only for reform rather than regime change . \nBut if Baathist rule collapsed , Syria would enter the unknown and long-hidden strains could surface . \nUnder any scenario , Syria is likely to be preoccupied with its internal problems for many months , reducing the chances that it will undertake any major initiative such as resuming peace negotiations with Israel over the occupied Golan Heights . \nThe impact of any regime change would reverberate across the Arab world and Iran . \nSyria , still formally at war with Israel , also has borders with Lebanon , Turkey , Iraq and Jordan . \nIsrael might be sorry if Assad fell . \nAlthough he has helped arm Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and harbored Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , he has maintained the calm prevailing on the Israeli-Syrian border since the 1973 war . \nTurmoil in Syria might see the pragmatic Baathists dislodged by Islamist or nationalist groups more hostile to Israel . \nThe United States , its hands full in Afghanistan , Iraq and Libya , said on Monday it was not working to undermine the Syrian government -- although the Washington Post , citing leaked U.S. diplomatic cables , said Syrian exiles and other dissidents had received up to $ 6 million in U.S. funds since 2006 . \nFor all Syria 's opposition to U.S. and Israeli policies in the Middle East , it has played a cautious hand , balancing its Arab nationalist ideology and links with Iran against its desire for acceptance in the West and ultimately peace with Israel . \nOn the other hand , Washington would see advantages in a new Sunni leadership in Damascus that might end Syria 's three-decade alliance with Shi'ite Iran and support for Hezbollah , in favor of closer ties with Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab powers . \nThat would reshape the political landscape in Lebanon , where Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies now hold the upper hand over their U.S.-backed Sunni and Christian opponents . \nAny downgrading of Iran 's alliance with Syria , its main conduit for aid to Hezbollah and Hamas , would damage Tehran 's ability to project its influence in the Middle East . \nIraq , a former Baathist rival of Syria and still on uneasy terms , would also feel the ripples from any upheaval in Damascus , which has played an often ambivalent role in its eastern neighbor since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . \nMost combustible for Lebanon , Iraq and the region would be sectarian or ethnic conflict in Syria , should it lose its secular Baathist straitjacket , fuelling tensions elsewhere between Sunnis and Shi'ites , Arabs and Kurds , or Christians and Muslims . \nAn ultra-low latency

{"id": "159", "time": "2011-04-19", "text": "GENEVA | Tue Apr 19 , 2011 7:01 pm BST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ronald `` Ronnie '' Farquhar , who covered the East-West Cold War for Reuters from almost every East European capital and Beijing in the 1950s and 1960s , died in Geneva on Tuesday , aged 88 , his family said . \nA Scot from Glasgow who joined Reuters in 1952 , he drove over 500 miles -LRB- 800 km -RRB- in fog on crumbling roads from Warsaw to Budapest in October 1956 to be on the spot to break the news when the Soviet Army put down Hungary 's anti-communist uprising . \nOver several days he dodged bullets amid fierce fighting on the streets , filing stories with the help of a trio of women who worked as telephonists in his hotel and once from an ancient telex machine in a rebel command post . \nForced to take refuge in the British embassy when the Soviet command imposed a 24-hour curfew , he still managed to stay on in Budapest until January 1957 , becoming one of the last Western reporters to leave when the new authorities ordered him out . \nA trooper in the British Army during World War Two , Farquhar survived the destruction of his tank by a German shell in Tunisia , suffering serious facial burns . \nWhen he joined Reuters after six years with local newspapers in Scotland and England , the burns effectively decided his career path after a doctor decreed that he should not expose his face to strong sun and must never have a tropical posting . \nA German-speaker , he was first sent to Frankfurt and then in 1955 to Czechoslovakia where he met his future wife Vera , an editorial assistant in the Reuters office in Prague . \nLike many Cold War romances between Westerners and East Europeans at the time , theirs ran foul of the communist bureaucracy . \nThey were not allowed to marry and Vera was refused an exit visa when he was transferred to Warsaw in 1956 . \nFor five years they carried on a long-distance relationship , including during the two years he was in Beijing from 1958-60 . \nFinally , the Czechoslovak authorities relented and they were married in Prague in 1960 . \nIn Beijing , he reported on the gradual estrangement between Communist China and the Soviet Union and the flaring of a border dispute with India . \n`` It was a great place to be at the time , totally different to anything else I had known , '' he once said . \nAfter Beijing , now with Vera , he went to Belgrade for four years , tracking not only Marshal Josip Broz Tito 's improving relationship with Moscow but also the decline of the `` liberal '' Yugoslav version of communism . \nOver the following years he was in Geneva , specialising in disarmament issues , again in Warsaw and the West German capital Bonn and then back to Geneva from 1973 to 1980 . \nHis last posting before retiring in 1983 was to Vienna where he followed the decline of the Soviet empire and the economies of the Eastern European countries , training many young Reuters journalists whom he infected with his love for the region . \nHe and Vera , who died in 2008 , settled in Geneva , and he worked part-time for Reuters until 1992 . \nHe is survived by the couple 's two daughters , Helen and Katarina . \n-LRB- Editing by Stephanie Nebehay and Alastair Macdonald -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
