'' \nOne problem is that Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists are in Bani Walid and Sirte , which are densely populated . \nThat makes it risky to try to bomb them because of the danger of civilian casualties . \nNATO , argues Shashank Joshi , an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London , lacks sufficient intelligence to allow it to pinpoint targets in Sirte and Bani Walid without endangering civilians . \n`` We are in a fortress situation where the city is under siege . \nIf you do n't know that a particular building is being used as a school or a mosque , even the best intelligence wo n't give you the details , '' he said . \n`` In Tripoli , you had rebels , you had -LRB- Western -RRB- special forces , networks of resistance . \nWe do n't have that kind of information in Sirte or Bani Walid . \nSo targeting is inherently difficult . '' \nTo a degree , battle conditions with Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists necessitate a change of operational approach because of the limitations of NATO jets ' firepower which is to dangerous to use , said Ripley of Jane 's Defense Weekly . \n`` Gaddafi forces are no longer using tanks and artillery that were easier to hit and identify . \nThe NTC is using infantry to drive Gaddafi 's forces from building to building , '' Ripley said . \n`` Both sides are operating in such close proximity that differentiating between the sides is difficult . \nThat makes it very difficult to use air-drop weapons -LRB- bombs -RRB- . '' \nExperts say other constraints also complicate NATO 's operations in Sirte and Bani Walid as its military commanders plan how to fulfill the alliance 's United Nations mandate in Libya to protect civilians during the civil war . \nSo far , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said , there are no confirmed cases of civilians being killed by NATO power , although alliance officials say some can not be ruled out . \nHuman rights organizations have called on the alliance to lean on NTC fighters to do more to protect civilians as worries mount for people trapped in Sirte . \nDesperation is growing in the besieged city as civilians try to flee the battle , both sides are accusing each other of endangering civilians , and aid agencies say a humanitarian disaster is looming because of shrinking supplies of water , electricity and food . \n`` NATO has significant influence over the actions of -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces , '' said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . \n`` And needs to use it to ensure that the NTC meet their legal obligation under international law -LRB- to avoid civilian casualties -RRB- , '' he said . \nAnother challenge for NATO , Bouckaert added , was preventing NTC forces from taking action against civilians they suspect of siding with Gaddafi loyalists . \n`` It is essential that those civilian populations , even if they are pro-Gaddafi , do not suffer from vengeance , '' he said . \nNATO officials acknowledge difficulties they are facing in Gaddafi 's last strongholds but have given little indication of how much firepower the deposed leader has at his disposal , other than `` small logistical and mobility capabilities '' . \n`` Their actions are limited to tactical initiatives in isolated pockets , representing a fraction of Libya 's territory and population , '' said NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie . \n`` They do n't control many access routes within Libya . \nThe mission is not yet over but the end is near , '' Focusing on Gaddafi loyalists ' access routes to supplies or way out of their strongholds might be an important part of NATO tactics in the near future , military experts said . \n`` A very big role NATO can play is to dominate the terrain , the roads outside of town , '' said Ripley . \n`` They can enforce the siege but they can not finish off Gaddafi forces . \nThey can prevent them from rebuilding , replenishing or escaping . '' \nAlready , NATO figures from recent days show the alliance 's targeting has focused on storage and command facilities and less on tanks and artillery assets . \nOutside of Sirte and Bani Walid , NATO forces will likely concentrate on hunting down any weaponry left behind by the Gaddafi regime , experts said . \n`` There is a lot of kit left in the country , '' said Douglas Barrie , a military aviation specialist at London 's International Institute of Strategic Studies . \n`` The bombing campaign did n't destroy all of the regime 's military capacity by any stretch of imagination . \nWe did n't have enough aircraft , we did n't have enough time . \n`` I suppose the -LRB- NATO -RRB- thinking is they do n't want to leave any credible rump of military capabilities that could cause problems for the transitional council .

'' \n`` Everyone knows how to use a gun , '' he said . \n`` The Libyans are an armed people . \nEven my mother knows guns . '' \nYasser 's brigade is officially recognized by the higher rebel authorities . \nIt was raised in Benghazi by a handful of young men who took up guns to protect the neighborhood against Gaddafi forces and criminals , and now numbers over 100 fighters . \nAs the civil war enters its sixth month , armed groups roam the streets in the rebel stronghold , raising fears of creeping lawlessness . \nThey drive around in pickups , firing their assault rifles into the air . \nIt is not always clear to which group they belong or whether it is approved by the National Transitional Council , recognized by some Western powers as Libya 's legitimate government . \n`` In my neighborhood there are groups who guard the area , they are not officially organised , but they have guns , '' said a rebel official . \n`` Anybody can go to the front and fight . \nIt is easy to get a gun . \nIf I take my AK-47 and want to fight on the front line , no one can stop me . '' \nBenghazi resident Essa , a steel worker before the war , proudly shows a video of 7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers made in his workshop from army weapons parts . \nThe RPGs were used against Gaddafi 's troops on the western front in Misrata . \nOthers put their military loot to questionable use . \nDull explosions echo round Benghazi harbor as fishermen detonate explosives in the sea for a quick catch . \nU.S. officials say they are worried about reports that al Qaeda may already be smuggling arms and explosives out of Libya . \nA United Nations official draws a parallel with the mayhem in Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion and the fall of Saddam . \n`` We kept telling them in Iraq that they have to secure the -LRB- weapons -RRB- stores , but no one listened , '' he said . \n`` Next we would see these weapons being smuggled across the border to Iran . '' \nThe Mahdi Army of anti-American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr started as a neighborhood protection force , but grew quickly in strength and was later blamed for much of the 2006-07 sectarian slaughter that drove Iraq to the brink of civil war . \nThe killing of Younes has raised similar concerns here . \nSome rebel sources say it was the work of Islamist militiamen in the rebel ranks , and exposed the opposition to the risk of a split that could spark a tribal feud . \nArmed groups such as Obaida Ibn Jarrah and Okbah Ibn Nafih brigades have been named as possible perpetrators . \nBoth are named after companions of the Prophet Mohammad . \nSome say Gaddafi loyalists were obviously behind the killing of Younes , who defected after holding top government posts for 40 years -- including that of interior minister , which would have put him at odds with Islamist opponents of Gaddafi . \nYounes 's tribe has sworn to get justice itself if the rebel leaders fail to investigate his death and catch his killers . \nHis death was followed by a prison break by some 300 Gaddafi loyalists and a battle between rebels and the militia who helped the prisoners to escape in the center of Benghazi . \nThe militiamen belong to a group called Nedaa Libya , or Libya 's Call , which is not an official force under rebel authority . \nFighters in Benghazi who know them never thought they might be Gaddafi loyalists until the prison break . \n`` We heard about them before but did n't know they were fifth columnists , '' said Faraj al-Sharif , a rebel fighter from the Martyrs of February 17th brigade . \nHe estimates their number at 1,000 fighters , many of them still at large . \n`` Every time we ask them to surrender , they stop for a while then they start firing at us and shout Allah , Muammar , Libya and that 's all , '' he said . \nBenghazi residents now talk of Gaddafi `` sleeper cells '' in guerrilla ranks and mistrust is spreading among the locals , who treat everyone with suspicion . \nRebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , trying to soothe public anger and avert a feud , urged militias to lay down their arms or come under the orders of the Defense or Interior ministries . \nIt remains unclear how he can follow up such exhortations . \n-LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Tim Pearce -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi toward Tripoli and regained control of major oil terminals in the OPEC state . \nA U.S. Treasury Department official said rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . \nWith its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . \nSome energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . \nOn Monday rebels met sporadic resistance as they pushed their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns . \nJust west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . \n`` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . \nRebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . \n`` We are advancing one , two kilometers at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . \nBut the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . \n`` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . \nReuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , saw police and military but no sign of fighting . \nSoldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . \nMilitiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . \n`` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . \nIn Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . \nSome housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out across the city . \nSeveral civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . \n`` Misrata is ours , there are still some bad guys in other parts , but Gaddafi is winning , the city is ours , '' resident Abduq Karim said . \n`` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . \n`` Everything you are hearing is a lie . \nThe function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . \nWe can not kill our own people .

Security Council authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . \nBut from the outset , the mission faced questions about its scope and aims , including the extent to which it will actively back the rebel side and whether it might target Gaddafi himself . \nThe start of allied bombings proved a turning point for the rebels who were hemmed into Benghazi at the time . \nRussia , which abstained in the U.N. vote , said Western attacks on Gaddafi forces amounted to taking sides . \n`` We consider that intervention by the coalition in what is essentially an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N.

'' \nHam , head of the U.S. military 's Africa Command , later acknowledged that the likelihood of a stalemate was higher now than before the United States passed control of the air campaign to NATO on March 31 . \n`` So right now we are facing the prospect of a stalemate , which then means Gaddafi remains in power , '' McCain said . \n`` Which then means that we will then have a very , very serious situation with Mr. Gaddafi in the future if he remains in power , particularly given his past record . '' \nThe debate underscored tensions within Washington about how to best influence events in Libya , where poorly trained rebels are outgunned by Gaddafi 's loyalist forces despite a coalition air campaign . \nAsked by Senator Lindsey Graham how the war would end , Ham said : `` I think it does not end militarily . '' \nHe said there was a low likelihood that rebels would be able to fight their way to Tripoli and oust Gaddafi by force . \n`` That 's a very honest answer . \nI would assess -LRB- the chance -RRB- as almost impossible , '' replied Graham , a Republican . \nBut Washington has also been reluctant to firmly side with the rebels , citing concerns that extremists might be among their ranks . \nA U.S. commander recently said that intelligence detected `` flickers '' of a possible al Qaeda presence among the rebels , and an Algerian official said al Qaeda had acquired some arms in Libya . \nHam renewed that cautious line on Thursday . \n`` We would need , I think , necessarily to be careful about providing lethal means to a group unless we are assured that those U.S.-provided weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist organizations , '' Ham said . \nHe cited the stated intent of al Qaeda 's North Africa arm , al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , to aid the opposition . \n`` It has been very difficult to ascertain whether that intent to support the opposition with AQIM personnel has actually materialized in anything on the ground , '' Ham said . \n`` We 're watching that for indications of that very clearly . '' \nHam defended the work of NATO in the face of criticism by the head of Libya 's rebels , who condemned the alliance this week for its slow chain of command in ordering air strikes to protect civilians . \nA NATO air strike on Thursday killed at least five rebels near the Libyan port of Brega . \nIt was the second time in less than a week that rebels had blamed NATO for bombing their comrades by mistake . \n-LRB- Editing by Vicki Allen and Laura MacInnis -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAnd now a US General says we do n't know the people of whom we have chosen sides in this civil war . \nThis is 100 % on Obama 's hands . \nHe committed our forces without going through the Congress . \nThis is what qualifies for a Nobel Peace Prize ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about deteriorating conditions for civilians in Misrata and Zintan in the west , and Brega in the east . \nHe said the situation in Misrata was particularly grave with the city under heavy bombardment and shortages of food , water and medical supplies . \nThe civil war has cut Libyan oil output by 80 percent , a senior government official said on Thursday , as rebels and Gaddafi 's forces traded charges over who had attacked oil fields vital to both sides . \nRebels say government attacks on three different installations in the east have halted production of the oil they desperately need to finance the uprising against Gaddafi . \nThe government 's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters the British air force had damaged an oil pipeline in a strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three guards . \nNATO denied the alliance carried out any air strikes in the Sarir area and said forces loyal to Gaddafi were responsible for an attack which started a fire in the oilfield . \nIt said Gaddafi was trying to disrupt oil supplies to the rebel-held port of Tobruk . \nAn oil executive in rebel territory called for more NATO air strikes to defend the fields , saying government forces were exposed in open areas away from civilians . \nShokri Ghanem , chairman of the government National Oil Corporation , told Reuters on Thursday the country 's production had fallen to 250,000 to 300,000 barrels per day compared with 1.6 million before the uprising . \nHe called a reported shipment of Libyan oil by the rebels `` very sad '' and said it would only contribute to tension and divide the country . \nThe Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from the port of Marsa el-Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday , apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since their uprising began in February . \nOil traders said the cargo , vital to fund the uprising , was headed for China . \nAfter reported advances by Gaddafi forces from Brega towards Ajdabiyah during the day , both sides appeared to have withdrawn within their secure lines by nightfall , following a familiar pattern . \nA senior U.S. Treasury official said Washington had frozen more than $ 34 billion of Libyan assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . \nEuropean governments had also frozen a substantial amount he said . \nGaddafi appealed for a halt in the air campaign in a rambling three-page letter to U.S. President Barack Obama bluntly dismissed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday . \n`` Mr. Gaddafi knows what he must do , '' Clinton told a news conference with Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , reiterating calls for a ceasefire , the withdrawal of his forces from cities they have stormed and his departure from Libya . \nCivil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year-old rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other rulers across the Arab world . \nA senior aid worker said on Thursday desperate refugees from North Africa had dragged each other under water and drowned when an overloaded migrant boat sank off Sicily . \nUp to 250 people were still missing from the capsized boat , which was said to have left Libya on Monday . \n"}

That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' \nBut General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . \n`` Day by day people are dying . \nHundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . \nPatience has its limits , '' he said . \nAsked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . \nNATO has other means . \nI requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . \nThese damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' \nLibyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . \nAccounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . \nRebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . \nSpokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . \nThe ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed '' . \nNATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . \nRelieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . \n`` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . \nGaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . \nMisrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . \n`` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . \nMortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . \n`` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' \nMeanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . \n`` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . \nMost people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . \nPeople are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . \nThe upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' \nOn the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . \nIll-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . \nRebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . \nRebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed concern about deteriorating conditions for civilians in Misrata and Zintan in the west , and Brega in the east . \nHe said the situation in Misrata was particularly grave with the city under heavy bombardment and shortages of food , water and medical supplies . \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was working on a `` road map '' to end the war in Libya which would include a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Gaddafi 's forces from some cities . \nTurkey has held talks with envoys from Gaddafi 's government and representatives of the opposition . \nA rebel spokesman said later the rebels rejected talks with Gaddafi and demanded he leave power . \nSweden said its warplanes operating from Sicily took part in NATO operations against Gaddafi on Thursday , the first combat sortie by the Nordic country 's air force since the early 1960s . \nThe civil war has cut Libyan oil output by 80 percent , a senior government official said on Thursday , as rebels and Gaddafi 's forces traded exchanged accusations over who had attacked oil fields vital to both sides . \nRebels say government attacks on three different installations in the east have halted production of the oil they desperately need to finance the uprising against Gaddafi . \nThe government 's Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters the British air force had damaged an oil pipeline in a strike against the Sarir oilfield which killed three guards . \nNATO denied the alliance carried out any air strikes in the Sarir area and said forces loyal to Gaddafi were responsible for an attack which started a fire in the oilfield . \nShokri Ghanem , chairman of the government National Oil Corporation , told Reuters on Thursday the country 's production had fallen to 250,000 to 300,000 barrels per day compared with 1.6 million before the uprising . \nThe Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from the port of Marsa el-Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday , apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since their uprising began in February . \nOil traders said the cargo , vital to fund the uprising , was headed for China . \nAfter reported advances by Gaddafi forces from Brega toward Ajdabiyah during the day , both sides appeared to have withdrawn within their secure lines by nightfall , following a familiar pattern . \nA senior Treasury official said Washington had frozen more than $ 34 billion of Libyan assets as part of sanctions against Gaddafi and his top officials . \nEuropean governments had also frozen a substantial amount he said . \n`` Mr. Gaddafi knows what he must do , '' Clinton told a news conference with Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , reiterating calls for a ceasefire , the withdrawal of his forces from cities they have stormed and his departure from Libya . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt is morally incorrect to support a rebellion , whose leaders one does not know , whose aims one is not sure of , I mean how would it turn out if say the rebels turned out to be Al Qaeda ? \nI dont know if they are , maybe they are all very nice people , but so was Qaddafi when he first took power . \nThis is an ill conceived mission that makes no sense at all . \nGaddafi and some people say that NATO is killing innocent civilians and it has to stop because it is unacceptable . \nFor some reason I do n't hear anyone saying that someone has to stop Gaddafi because he is using Human Shields and killing innocent civilians now and for 41 years for his and his sons amussment . \nWhat has to happen is that NATO needs to find a way aroung Gaddafi 's tactics and save the rebels that are being killed in Misrata and around Libya before it 's too late . \nAll the rebels want is to be free of a tyrant and to live in a Democratic country . \nThe other day I saw a picture of a little girl in Misrata with a severe wound caused by Gaddafi 's fighters firing wildly into Misrata . \nTell me is a little girl no more then ten years old a rebel fighter or an innocent civilian , now who is killing innocent civilians , I believe Gaddafi 's govenment fighters are killing more innocent civilians then NATO by a far amount . \nThis is an Unconstitutional war that we have no right being in . \nWhen will Obama be held accountable for this war ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "30", "time": "2011-03-10", "text": "RAS LANUF , Libya | Thu Mar 10 , 2011 6:41 pm EST RAS LANUF , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan tanks fired on rebel positions around the oil port of Ras Lanuf and warplanes hit another oil hub further east Thursday as Muammar Gaddafi carried counter-attacks deeper into the insurgent heartland . \nIn the west , Gaddafi 's army laid siege to try to starve out insurgents clinging to parts of the shattered city of Zawiyah , strategically significant because it is close to his powerbase in the capital Tripoli , after fierce see-saw battles this week . \nBut the rebels took an important step toward international legitimacy when France recognized their national council . \nWhile oil prices have been kept high by the bombardments in the east of the Arab North African state , there was no clear sign of deliberate intent by Gaddafi to ruin oil infrastructure . \nNATO and the European Union were looking into imposing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya to stop the government using jets and helicopters against the outgunned rebels , who seized a string of cities east and west of Tripoli early in the three-week-old war to end Gaddafi 's 41 years of iron-fisted rule . \nDespite rebel appeals to take the skies away from Gaddafi 's forces , no quick action was expected as NATO has made clear it needs wider , United Nations endorsement for such a move . \nMore than 500 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , Gaddafi 's warplanes and gunboats off the Mediterranean coast bombarded rebels around Ras Lanuf , with projectiles crashing close to a building of the Libyan Emirates Oil Refinery Company . \nThere was a series of air strikes , and insurgents fired anti-aircraft guns toward warplanes and rockets out to sea toward Gaddafi 's naval forces , without visible effect . \nTwo rebel fighters said they saw Ras Lanuf 's residential area , including the vicinity of its hospital , get bombed and that government forces had fired rockets from sea , air and ground . \nThere was no apparent damage to the hospital . \nLater , at least two tanks were seen bearing down on ragged rebel lines outside Ras Lanuf and opening fire . \nThe rebels also reported an air strike on Brega , another oil port 90 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- east of Ras Lanuf , indicating that Gaddafi loyalists had not only halted a westwards insurgent push in its tracks but were making inroads into the rebels ' eastern centers . \nState television said rebels had been ousted from the port and airport of Es Sider , a further oil terminus about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- up the coast west of Ras Lanuf . \nOPEC member Libya was turning away tankers from ports as storage depots dried up because of supply disruptions caused by the fighting . \nLibya 's oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks refuse to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , cutting off major importers such as Italy and France . \nThe intensified fighting near oil installations kept crude prices hovering near recent 2.5-year highs , with Brent crude trading at $ 114.55 a barrel . \nThe rebels , hitherto bursting with confidence that they would soon charge hundreds of km -LRB- miles -RRB- up the Mediterranean desert coast , overwhelming any resistance , to capture Gaddafi 's main bastion Tripoli , now conceded they were struggling to hold ground against the government 's vastly superior firepower . '' \n-LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- might take it . \nWith planes , tanks , mortars and rockets , he might take it , '' said rebel fighter Basim Khaled . \n`` A no-fly zone would be great , '' said rebel fighter Salem al-Burqy , echoing the view of many beleaguered cohorts . \nGaddafi 's counter-offensive has stymied a rebel advance from their eastern power base of Benghazi . \nThey were forced to withdraw from the front-line town of Bin Jawad , just west of Ras Lanuf , after coming under heavy shelling earlier this week . \nOne fighter said rebels had retaken the heart of Zawiyah , the closest city -- 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west -- to Tripoli , from the army overnight . \nZawiyah 's center appeared to change hands twice during the day in a fierce battle . \n`` We fought until after three in the morning . \nIt 's all quiet here this morning , '' said the insurgent , named Ibrahim , by phone . \nMohamed , a Libyan in exile abroad who got through to a relative on the outskirts of Zawiyah Thursday morning , said it was simply not clear who was winning the battle for the city but the army had it under siege to break the rebels ' will . \n`` Yesterday -LRB- rebel sympathizers -RRB- tried to bring food and medicine from Subratha but failed . \nGovernment troops surround Zawiyah from everywhere . \nIt is unclear who controls the center . \nIt changes all the time . \nIt 's street to street fighting . '' \nAuthorities have kept journalists away from Zawiyah . \nFrance became the first significant country Thursday to recognize the rebel Libyan National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . \nAn official at President Nicolas Sarkozy 's office said France would send an ambassador to Benghazi and receive a Libyan envoy in Paris . \nHe was speaking after Sarkozy met officials from the Libyan National Council . \nBritain 's Foreign Office suggested it could make the same opening as France , saying Libyan National Council members were `` valid interlocutors '' and Gaddafi should step down now . \n`` The UK recognizes states , not governments . \nThe interim national council are valid interlocutors , with whom we wish to work closely , '' a Foreign Office spokesman said . \nThe U.S. Defense Department said it was preparing a `` full range '' of military options for Libya , including a no-fly zone . \nNATO ministers were to weigh up options at talks in Brussels on Thursday . \nMilitary officers said a zone could be set up quickly . \nRebel forces have appealed to Washington and its allies to impose a no-fly zone to deny Gaddafi 's forces the advantage of using warplanes and prevent him moving troops by helicopter . \nA no-fly zone could also help protect civilians who have been caught in the fighting , with scores if not more people reported killed so far in cities like Zawiyah . \nA burgeoning humanitarian emergency could hasten a no-fly decision . \nCALL TO AVOID SHOOTING AT CIVILIANS In Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Libya had descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in the east . \nICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli and reminded both sides that civilians and medical facilities must not be targeted . \nGeneral Raymond Odierno , commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , said the U.S. military was probably capable of establishing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya `` within a couple of days '' if the international community so decided . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made it clear imposing a no-fly zone is a matter for the United Nations and should not be a U.S.-led initiative . \nRussia and China , permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , oppose the idea , which could entail bombing Libyan air defenses as a first step . \nRussia said Thursday military intervention would be unacceptable , but acted to help isolate Gaddafi by banning all weapons sales to Libya , effectively suspending major arms contracts with his government . \nItaly , whose bases could play a critical role in any military action , has said it will back any decisions taken by NATO , the EU or the United Nations , clearing the way for U.S. naval forces based in Naples to be deployed if needed . \nTwo members of Libya 's opposition council visited the European Parliament Wednesday and said they wanted EU moral support , political recognition and a no-fly zone shielding the territory they hold -- but not any form of military intervention in a country sensitive about former colonial domination . \nCounter-attacks by Gaddafi loyalists suggest the flamboyant leader , in power since a 1969 coup , will not go as quietly or quickly as fellow leaders in Egypt and Tunisia did in a tide of popular unrest rolling across the Arab world . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt is simply a fantasy he wo n't attack them . \nWhen loyalists can not overtake the strong-hold of the rebels , the pro-Gadi camp is likely to destroy the enemy 's wealth i.e. oil facilities . \nWhat a tragedy the world is watching unfold in front of us . \nNot for Gaddafi or the rebels but for the hundreds of innocent men women and children who a getting killed as a result of this battle . \nEvery day I read in news items of what the world s powers are going to do or can do but the bottom line while they are all thinking about it nothing is getting done . \nThe truth is that no matter what they say they are doing they in fact are waiting to see how this conflict unfolds and then they can take the appropriate action that will not leave them with egg on their face . \nHilary Clinton like a school kid when asked to participate is saying `` We will if you will `` . \nCan we really blame the Americans for this attitude when they are already extremely unpopular because of their involvement in other Arab world issues , not forgetting Israel . \nEurope don t seem to be rushing to Hilary s aid and are making statements such as `` we could have this No fly zone in place very quickly if necessary `` but they are not implemeting it , and if Italy are seen to be pro rebels they have a lot to lose if Gaddafi wins . \nThe Russians and China have their own agendas for reasons similar to Italy , what if Gaddafi wins , all their trade with Lybia goes down the pan . \nFinally the Arab world , they may not like Gaddafi but they have seen rebellions in other Arab countries oust their presidents , a win for the rebels in Lybia would really open the flood gates for the remaining Arab world . \nSaudia rulers have already stated that protests in their country will not be allowed so a win for Gaddafi will strengthen their position . \nThe bottom line is that the Lybian rebels based on what they saw in Egypt hoped they could topple Gaddafi easily , and if needed the rest of the world would support them . \nWell I m sorry folks but it appears that the rest of the world are thinking about it and thinking about and thinking about it . \n`` Libya will turn into civil war if my father steps down '' , so said by Gaddafi 's son . \nThe civil war already started 3 weeks ago , it will end when his father flees or faces death penalty . \n`` The no-fly zone has to be sanctioned by U.N. security council '' , so said by Hillary Clinton . \nWhy participation in Afghan and Iraq wars were not ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Navy photo\\/Handout By Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy TRIPOLI | Sat Mar 19 , 2011 7:34 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western forces hit targets along the Libyan coast on Saturday , using strikes from air and sea to force Muammar Gaddafi 's troops to cease fire and end attacks on civilians . \nFrench planes fired the first shots in what is the biggest international military intervention in the Arab world since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , destroying tanks and armored vehicles in the region of the rebels ' eastern stronghold , Benghazi . \nHours later , U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles against air defenses around the capital Tripoli and the western city of Misrata , which has been besieged by Gaddafi 's forces , U.S. military officials said . \nThey said U.S. forces and planes were working with Britain , France , Canada and Italy in operation `` Odyssey Dawn '' . \nGaddafi called it `` colonial , crusader '' aggression . \n`` It is now necessary to open the stores and arm all the masses with all types of weapons to defend the independence , unity and honor of Libya , '' he said in an audio message broadcast on state television hours after the strikes began . \nState television said the `` crusader enemy '' hit civilian areas of Tripoli and fuel storage tanks that supplied Misrata . \nResidents in Misrata said air strikes had targeted a military airbase where Gaddafi loyalists were based . \nSeveral Tripoli residents said they heard an explosion near the eastern Tajoura district . \n`` I heard an explosion . \nI saw a flash , it was a very strong explosion , '' said one . \nIn Benghazi , where earlier on Saturday rebels said they had beaten back an advance by Gaddafi 's troops , residents welcomed the military intervention but were also apprehensive . \n`` We think this will end Gaddafi 's rule . \nLibyans will never forget France 's stand with them . \nIf it were n't for them , then Benghazi would have been overrun tonight , '' said Iyad Ali , 37 . \n`` We salute , France , Britain , the United States and the Arab countries for standing with Libya . \nBut we think Gaddafi will take out his anger on civilians . \nSo the West has to hit him hard , '' said Khalid al-Ghurfaly , a civil servant , 38 . \nEarlier on Saturday , leaders meeting in Paris announced the start of military intervention after Gaddafi 's troops pushed into the outskirts of Benghazi in spite of a U.N. resolution passed on Thursday calling for an end to attacks on civilians . \n`` Those taking part agreed to put in place all necessary means , especially military , to enforce the decisions of the United Nations Security Council , '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy said after the meeting of Western and Arab leaders . \n`` Colonel Gaddafi has made this happen , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting . \n`` We can not allow the slaughter of civilians to continue . '' \nSome analysts have questioned the strategy for the military intervention , fearing western forces might be sucked into a long civil war despite a U.S. insistence -- repeated on Saturday -- that it has no plans to send ground troops into Libya . \nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper suggested that outside powers hoped their intervention would be enough to turn the tide against Gaddafi and allow Libyans to force him out . \n`` It is our belief that if Mr. Gaddafi loses the capacity to enforce his will through vastly superior armed forces , he simply will not be able to sustain his grip on the country . '' \nA U.S. military slide showed some 25 coalition ships , including three U.S. submarines armed with Tomahawk missiles , are stationed in the Mediterranean . \nThe Libyan government has blamed rebels , who it says belong to al Qaeda , for breaking a ceasefire it announced on Friday . \nIn Tripoli , several thousand people gathered at the Bab al-Aziziyah palace , Gaddafi 's compound that was bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 , to show their support . \n`` There are 5,000 tribesmen that are preparing to come here to fight with our leader . \nThey better not try to attack our country , '' said farmer Mahmoud el-Mansouri . \n`` We will open up Libya 's deserts and allow Africans to flood to Europe to blow themselves up as suicide bombers . '' \nU.S. SAYS NOT LEADING INTERVENTION France and Britain have taken a lead role in pushing for international intervention in Libya and the United States -- after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- has been at pains to stress it is supporting , not leading , the operation . \nIn announcing the missile strikes , which came eight years to the day after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , Obama said the effort was intended to protect the Libyan people . \n`` Today I authorized the armed forces of the United States to begin a limited action in Libya in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians , '' Obama told reporters in Brasilia , where he had begun a five-day tour of Latin America . \nHe said U.S. troops were acting in support of allies , who would lead the enforcement of a no-fly zone to stop Gaddafi 's attacks on rebels . \n`` As I said yesterday , we will not , I repeat , we will not deploy any U.S. troops on the ground , '' Obama said . \nBut despite Washington 's determination to stress the limits of its role , Vice Admiral Bill Gortney , director of the U.S. military 's Joint Staff , said the missile strikes were only the first phase of a multiphase action . \nMany analysts do not think Western powers would be satisfied with a de facto partition which left the rebels in control in the east and Gaddafi running a rump state in the west . \nOne participant at the Paris meeting said that Clinton and others had stressed Libya should not be split in two . \nAnd Obama on Friday specifically called on Gaddafi 's forces to pull back from the western cities of Zawiyah and Misrata as well from the east . \nBut security analysts have questioned what western powers will do if Gaddafi digs in . \n`` It 's going to be far less straightforward if Gaddafi starts to move troops into the cities which is what he has been trying to do for the past 24 hours , '' said Marko Papic at the STRATFOR global intelligence group . \n`` Once he does that it becomes a little bit more of an urban combat environment and at that point it 's going to be difficult to use air power from 15,000 feet to neutralize that . '' \nEarlier on Saturday hundreds of cars full of refugees fled Benghazi toward the Egyptian border after the city came under a bombardment overnight . \nOne family of 13 women from a grandmother to small children , rested at a roadside hotel . \n`` I 'm here because when the bombing started last night my children were vomiting from fear , '' said one of them , a doctor . \n`` All I want to do is get my family to a safe place and then get back to Benghazi to help . \nMy husband is still there . '' \nThose who remained set up make-shift barricades with furniture , benches , road signs and even a barbecue in one case at intervals along main streets . \nEach barricade was manned by half a dozen rebels , but only about half of those were armed . \nIn the besieged western city of Misrata , residents said government forces shelled the rebel town again early on Saturday , while water supplies had been cut off for a third day . \n`` I am telling you , we are scared and we are alone '' , a Misrata resident , called Saadoun , told Reuters by telephone . \n-LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Abbas and Angus MacSwan in Benghazi , Tom Perry in Cairo , Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy in Tripoli , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Christian Lowe in Algiers ; John Irish and Elizabeth Pineau in Paris , Missy Ryan in Washington , Writing by Myra MacDonald ; Editing by Jon Boyle -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nFor once , Obama acted the way we all hoped he would act . \nWith reason , sane , and decidedly , but in way to prevent war or destruction with war action as much as possible . \nIt will obviously be in Gaddafi 's interest not to contravene the no-fly order because he stands to loose his fleet and anti-aircraft defenses . \nIronically , that he entire struggle of the tow opposing sides has to be stopped now and that it will need diplomacy to find a way that includes all sides ' necessities , results in the negotiations which Venezuelan president Chavez suggested . \nLets see if anyone has the stones to enforce it . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nHis defiance came a day after Western and Arab powers , led by the United States , said the rebel leadership was the legitimate government of Libya . \nReports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis . \nLibyan television also reported what it called an `` enemy attack '' on Tajoura district east of Tripoli early on Sunday , the first such bombing raid by NATO near the capital in several nights , a Reuters witness said . \nThe television said the strike had hit `` civilian and military sites '' but did not specify what they were or mention if there had been any casualties . \nBrega 's oil resources make it a prize for the rebels , who have been trying to dislodge Gaddafi 's troops in the face of rocket bombardments , according to Al Jazeera television . \nMost opposition fighters are about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- outside Brega , kept back by Grad rockets fired by government forces , the network reported . \nThe rebels had however captured four government soldiers . \nIn the Western Mountains , where insurgents are trying to push toward Tripoli , heavy fighting erupted on Saturday . \nSustained gunfire and volleys of artillery could be heard from the village of Bir Ayad , 15 km -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- south of the front line at the town of Bir Ghanam . \nRebels at Bir Ghanam hold the high ground on the outskirts of the town , their closest position to Tripoli , about 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away . \nAhmed , a rebel fighter in Bir Ayad , said a convoy of about 15 vehicles from Gaddafi 's forces tried to approach Bir Ghanam , but the rebels fired at it and the convoy retreated after a about an hour of shooting . \n`` They were in a column at first but when we started firing they split into groups of three or four vehicles and all of them fled , '' local rebel commander Fathi Alzintani told Reuters . \nRebels in the Western Mountains have made progress in recent weeks after repelling assaults by Gaddafi 's forces . \nTheir next goal is Garyan , a town that controls the highway south from Tripoli . \nBut the rebels have been hampered by divisions , ill-discipline and supply problems . \nIn Misrata , the rebels ' main stronghold in the west , six rebel fighters have been killed and four injured in the past 24 hours , hospital staff said . \nAway from the battlefield , Gaddafi has made a series of audio speeches to coincide with state television broadcasts of rallies attended by thousands of people in Tripoli and elsewhere . \nAs loyalists gathered on the streets of the town of Zawiyah , near the capital , on Saturday , Gaddafi said the rebels were `` apostates '' who had `` become Christians . '' \nCalling on the rebels to lay down their arms , he said : `` Islam is being humiliated by the cross ... They are burning mosques with bombs . '' \n`` We have given martyrs , yes ... It 's impossible to compromise or make the slightest concession . '' \nCrowds were shown firing to the air at the end of the speech . \nRebel leaders received a boost in their campaign to oust Gaddafi on Friday when they won recognition as the legitimate government of Libya from the United States and other powers . \nWestern nations said they planned to increase the military pressure on Gaddafi 's forces to make him to give up power after 41 years at the head of the North African state . \nRecognition of the rebels by the international contact group on Libya is an important diplomatic step that could unlock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . \nThe decision came as reports circulated Gaddafi had sent out emissaries seeking a negotiated end to the conflict , although he remains defiant in public . \nThe contact group also agreed on a road map whereby Gaddafi should relinquish power and put forward plans for Libya 's transition to democracy under the rebel National Transitional Council . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe 're nothing but war mongers anyway . \nMaybe God has chosen us for destruction , and with good reason ! \nAbove all , the European Union must start acting like a responsible force in world affairs , not a many-headed monster . \nThe Financial Times published that on February 23 , right as the civil war in Libya erupted . \nUnfortunately , Europe along with America has continued to act like a many-headed monster , particularly in Libya . \nTo begin with , the West failed to help countries like Libya develop their economies before the war began . \nIn fact , the West promised to help Libya develop its economy after Libya agreed to abandon its nuclear program . \nBut instead of doing that , the West seemed happy to support and encourage organizations intent on overthrowing the existing regime . \nIn particular , Britain supported the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , a terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda whose objective was to overthrow Gaddafi . \nIn 1996 , British intelligence even hired that organization to assassinate Gaddafi . \nBritain has connections to several members of LIFG . \nThe founder of LIFG , Norman Benotman , has lived in London since 1995 . \nWhile living in London , he met members of Al Qaeda such as Abu Qatada and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar . \nBefore moving to London , he lived in Sudan where he met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri . \nBritain also has connections to another member of LIFG , Anas al-Liby . \nHe also knew Osama bin Laden . \nDespite the fact that America believes he had a role in the 1998 African embassy bombings , Britain gave him political asylum and allowed him to live in Manchester until May of 2000 . \nInterestingly , Libya issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March of 1998 . \nAt that time , British and American intelligence tried to conceal the origins of the arrest warrant and they minimized the danger of bin Laden . \nThe fact that Britain provided sanctuary to two members of LIFG and the fact the Britain paid LIFG to assassinate Gaddafi suggests strongly that Britain controls the organization . \nAnd the fact that British and American intelligence tried to squash an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden suggests they controlled him as well . \nRead the rest of the article at : This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "213", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "TRIPOLI | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 11:00 pm GMT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Attacks on Libya are likely to slow in the coming days , a U.S. general said on Monday , as Western powers consolidate a no-fly zone that some say is unlikely to bring an early end to the country 's civil war . \nRebels who began a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi a month ago have so far done little to capitalize on a two-day bombardment that halted an advance by government forces on their Benghazi stronghold and targeted Libya 's air defences . \nBut Washington , wary of being sucked into another war after long campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out specific action to overthrow Gaddafi , though France said on Monday it hoped the Libyan government would collapse from within . \n`` My sense is that -- that unless something unusual or unexpected happens , we may see a decline in the frequency of attacks , '' General Carter Ham , who is leading U.S. forces in the Libyan operation , told reporters in Washington . \nHe added , however , that `` we possess the capability to bring overwhelming combat power to bear , as we have done in the initial stages of this , where it 's been required . '' \nLibyan state television reported that several sites in the capital Tripoli had been subject to new attacks by what it called the `` crusader enemy '' on Monday . \nReuters reporters heard two big explosions followed by anti-aircraft fire in Tripoli on Monday evening . \nThe United States has run into some criticism for the intensity of the firepower used on Libya , which included more than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired on Saturday to take out Libya 's air defences and allow Western planes to patrol the skies . \nAlthough a U.N. resolution authorised `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , Arab League chief Amr Moussa has questioned the methods used , while Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air campaign to `` medieval crusades . '' \nPresident Barack Obama said the United States , which has been joined by Britain , France , Canada and Italy among others in the air campaign , planned to transfer the lead military role shortly . \nBritain and France led calls for the intervention . \n`` We anticipate this transition to take place in a matter of days and not in a matter of weeks , '' Obama told a news conference during a visit to Chile . \nLibyan rebels have welcomed the air strikes and at the frontline along the coast from Benghazi have cheered warplanes as they roar overhead . \nRebel headquarters also say they are coordinating with the Western powers launching air strikes . \nBut there was little sign at the vanguard of battle in east Libya that this communication extended to forward rebel units . \nWestern powers say they are not providing close air support to rebels or seeking to destroy Gaddafi 's army , but rather only protecting civilians , as their U.N. mandate allows , leaving disorganised rebel fighters struggling to make headway . \n`` If we do n't get more help from the West , Gaddafi 's forces will eat us alive , '' rebel fighter Nouh Musmari told Reuters . \nLeaders of the rebel movement in Benghazi have admitted their forces need more training . \nIn the past , they also complained their over-enthusiastic fighters were too quick to race ahead , only to be driven back by Gaddafi 's army . \nGaddafi 's forces have also tried to push into cities where they would be less vulnerable to attack from the air , while in the capital Tripoli people have rallied to support their leader . \nSecurity analysts say they are unclear what will happen if the Libyan leader digs in , especially since Western powers have made clear they would be unwilling to see Libya partitioned between a rebel-held east and Gaddafi-controlled west . \n`` Libya will not be a cakewalk , '' said Glen Howard , president of the Jamestown Foundation think tank . \nHe added that the conflict 's current phase was reminiscent of the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 , which failed to meet expectations it would bring down Slobodan Milosevic within days . \n`` There is still a real risk of a protracted stalemate , with neither side wanting to negotiate . \nSo the endgame remains very unclear , '' said Jeremy Binnie , a senior analyst with IHS Jane 's . \nIn an appearance on Libyan television on Sunday , Gaddafi promised his enemies a `` long war . '' \nOfficials in Tripoli said earlier that one missile in the second wave of attacks , which they said was intended to kill Gaddafi , had destroyed a building in his fortified compound , heavily bombed in 1986 by the Reagan administration . \n`` It was a barbaric bombing , '' said government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim , showing pieces of shrapnel that he said came from the missile . \n`` This contradicts American and Western -LRB- statements -RRB- ... that it is not their target to attack this place . '' \nA Libyan government spokesman also said that foreign attacks had killed many people by bombing ports and Sirte airport . \n`` You saw that place -LRB- Sirte airport -RRB- , '' Mussa Ibrahim told a news conference . \n`` It 's a civilian airport . \nIt was bombarded and many people were killed . \nHarbours were also bombarded . '' \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said there were no plans to target Gaddafi . \n`` The U.N. resolution is limited in its scope , it explicitly does not provide legal authority for action to bring about Gaddafi 's removal from power by military means , '' Cameron told parliament . \n`` We will help fulfil the U.N. Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- , it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny , but our view is clear , there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power .

Bush 's decision to invade in March 2003 . \n`` This is different to Iraq . \nThis is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' Cameron said . \n`` This is about protecting people and giving the Libyan people a chance to shape their own destiny , '' he said . \nForeign Secretary William Hague said the Libya operation would be funded from a Treasury reserve and not from the defense budget , which faces a real-terms cut of 8 percent over the next four years as part of efforts to curb a big budget deficit . \nIn a debate almost exactly eight years ago , the British parliament gave Blair a green light to wage war on Iraq despite a massive revolt within his own party . \nThe 10-month-old Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has stressed that the Libya situation is very different from the Iraq war , which clouded Blair 's premiership . \nUnlike the Iraq invasion , the Libya no-fly zone has been authorised by the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council resolution expressly bars occupation . \nLabor leader Ed Miliband supported Cameron , saying : `` We have seen with our own eyes what the Libyan regime is capable of . \nWe 've seen guns being turned on unarmed demonstrators . '' \nBut some MPs , particularly left-wing Labor members , voiced doubts about what Britain was getting into . \n`` I 'm far from convinced that the public are behind this , '' Labor legislator Jeremy Corbyn said . \n`` They are very concerned about where it leads to because they 've been through the miserable experience of Iraq and they have deep concerns additionally about Afghanistan , '' he said . \nBritain has 10,000 troops fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan . \n`` We should n't be in there , we 've got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35-year-old pipe fitter , told Reuters when asked about the Libya campaign . \n`` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Zimbabwe . \nWe ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . '' \nConservative MP Edward Leigh called for a rethink of last year 's British defense review which he said had been a `` disaster . '' \nThe review has paved the way for sharp cuts in armed forces ' equipment and personnel . \nCameron said there was no action without risk . \n`` But ... we have to weigh the risks of inaction ... the consequences for Europe of a failed pariah state on its southern border . \nAll of these , in my view , are simply too great to ignore , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "286", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "Analysis : Recent history points to host of Libya war risks LONDON | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 10:22 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers attacking Libya may hope air and missile strikes alone will topple Muammar Gaddafi and perhaps usher in democracy -- but recent history suggests they could be in for a long and complex engagement . \nAir strikes aimed at halting ethnic violence had only limited effect in achieving their goals in Bosnia and Kosovo until backed with the threat of effective ground action or at least the deployment of well-armed peacekeepers . \nIn Afghanistan , an air campaign and special forces support was enough to oust the Taliban from power after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks -- but that war is far from over a decade on with thousands of NATO troops battling an ongoing insurgency . \nIn Iraq , more than a decade of sanctions , a no-fly zone and repeated bouts of air strikes that followed the end of the 1991 war helped Kurdish regions remain largely free from Saddam Hussein but otherwise allowed him to remain in power . \nA change in western policy and overwhelming military force swiftly ended his rule in 2003 , but that proved the beginning of a bloody civil war and protracted U.S.-led military intervention is only just drawing to a close . \nThe speed with which Britain , the United States and France have found themselves effectively at war in Libya at a time when much attention was focused on Japan 's earthquake has meant there was little of the public debate that preceded the 2003 Iraq war . \n`` There 's obviously the issue of timing -- that leaving things any longer would have allowed Gaddafi to produce a bloodbath , '' said Anthony Skinner , associate director of political risk consultancy Maplecroft . \n`` But it 's still far from a foregone conclusion that this will work . \nGaddafi obviously has a vested interest in dragging things out in the hope that he will survive . \nIn the long run , stopping him might require the deployment of ground troops and there seems very little appetite for that and resources are very thin . '' \nThe United Nations resolution that ushered in action to protect civilians specifically ruled out a foreign occupation but endorsed `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . \nPerhaps deliberately , that leaves many options including limited ground intervention in support of rebels already recognized by France as the legitimate government of Libya . \nThe question , analysts say , is how much political will is really there -- and what they want to achieve with it . \n`` The long-term goal , unspoken but well understood , is regime change , '' wrote George Friedman , head of political risk consultancy Stratfor . \n`` It should be remembered that in Iraq and Afghanistan ... regime change was merely the opening act . \nIt is possible that the coalition partners have n't decided on the strategy yet , or may not be in agreement . '' \nFrance and Britain have both occasionally intervened in African civil wars in the past decade -- such as in Sierra Leone in 2001 -- but on the side of governments . \nBacking rebels against a strong central authority is a different matter -- likely requiring more outside intervention should Gaddafi 's rule crumble or collapse . \n`` Once it looks possible to force a political process , the international community will need to back a diplomatic engagement , '' said senior policy fellow Daniel Korski at the European Council on Foreign Relations , a veteran of reconstruction efforts in Iraq , Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia and strong supporter of intervention in Libya . \nHe said the European Union and NATO might have to be involved perhaps with the Arab League or African Union in what he called a `` light-touch monitoring mission . '' \nWith French jets targeting Libyan armored vehicles on the outskirts of Benghazi on Saturday , military action has already gone well beyond the `` no-fly zone '' initially suggested by Britain and France and endorsed by the Arab League . \nEven with air strikes , most experts believe the rebels will need outside help to improve their currently near-nonexistent command and control capabilities . \nThe bottom line , some strategists say , is that there are some things only ground forces can do . \nOnce Gaddafi 's forces are mixed amongst civilian areas , there may be little air strikes can achieve without considerable `` collateral damage . '' \n`` Air power has its limitations , '' said Henry Wilkinson , lead analyst at security consultancy Janusian . \n`` It will not inflict a decisive blow , nor prevent attacks on civilians in all cases . \nOnly ground forces can take territory , provide local security and impose their political will upon an enemy . '' \nAnalysts point to many unknowns . \nWill intervention in Libya give new confidence to protesters in other autocratic Middle Eastern states including oil producers -- and how might the West respond ? \nCould civilian casualties turn local , regional and domestic Western opinion against the campaign and play into the hands of Islamist militants ? \n`` The early days will go extremely well but will not define whether or not the war is successful , '' wrote Stratfor 's Friedman . \n`` The test will come if a war designed to stop human suffering begins to inflict human suffering . \nThat is when the difficult political decisions have to be made .

{"id": "42", "time": "2011-03-21", "text": "Western powers launched a second wave of air strikes on Libya on Monday after halting the advance of Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on Benghazi and targeting air defenses to let their planes patrol the skies . \nThe U.N.-mandated intervention to protect civilians drew criticism from Arab League chief Amr Moussa , who questioned the need for a heavy bombardment , which he said had killed many civilians . \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the U.N. resolution resembled `` medieval calls for crusades . '' \nBut the United States , carrying out the air strikes in a coalition with Britain , France , Italy and Canada among others , said the campaign was working . \nThe intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . \nDo you support the U.N.-mandated intervention in Libya ? \nYes I support the air strikes No I do not support the air strikes Have the Western forces been prudent in their air strikes or shown disregard for civilian casualties ? \nCivilian casualties are an unfortunate and unavoidable side effect of the Western airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths where does it end ? \nIn Yeme , Syria , Bahrein , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , UAE , Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Thailand , Venezuela ? \nThis is a slippery slope caused by Anderson Cooper and Fouad Ajami `` greased '' by oil . \nDo we never learn ? \nHow many wars will it take till we know , that too many people have died ? \nThe majority of them at the hands of U.S. weaponry . \nhere we go wading in again blinkered , what is the end game if mr. gaddafi do n't play ball with the west ? \nanother occupation of another muslim country ? \nmore overstretched british forces poured into another conflict ? \nwhy ar n't the arab nations taking the lead and dealing with the problem surely the political implications for western involvement is obvious . \nIt is no business of the west . \nI from Canada do not support our military action in Libya . \nThere are better ways and it saddens me to see Canada jump on the US bandwagon . \nThis military action does not benefit the world as a whole , and I hope that Canadians as well as the rest of the world can see this . \nThe end does not justify the means . \nAt the end of the day , this is a civil war , and 2 % of the world s oil production is simply not worth it ladies and gentlemen of the United Nations . \nIt is extremely unfortunate that the innocent citizens of Libya are the victims of Muammar Gaddafi s crazy antics , but ultimately this is their war , and it should remain as such . \nThe United States and its allies should seek to help those on their own sidewalks prior to lending it s resources to other nations . \nWe too vote strongly for an end to all violence and world peace , but we do not have a magic wand to do so immediately , and as history has proven over and over again , before any major reform or change , war precedes . \nSo the rebels are now jumping for joy . \nThere is an old saying that says people who jump for joy should beware of the ground moving beneath their feet . \nIt 's a bit too soon to know how this will play out . \nOne thing for certain is that there will be winners and more losers . \nThe last formal declaration of war was 70 years ago ... `` Only the dead have seen the end of war '' . \n-LRB- Plato -RRB- War , will never end . \nFrom one side or the other , there will be someone who star killing for money or power . \nEven if you pick a side or not , the effects of war will affect your way of living . \nSo now the Arab League -- whatever the h3ll that is -- has done a 180 and jumps on us for attacking Qaddafi 's air control system . \nThis is exactly why we should never get involved with this stupidity . \nFor heaven 's sake Americans -- wake up ! \nAnd Obama was gonna get us out of Iraq and Afghanistan ? \n-- yeah , right ! \nThe Arab league , the African Union , China , Russia -- a paltry few other nations are against this . \nWould it have passed a vote in the General assembly , not a pedophile 's chance in Hell . \nThank goodness for the Security Council and those who wo n't use their veto . \nHear that Mssrs Putin and JinTou ? \nYou used poor phrasing in the second question and you will note that you had the lowest participation in that question . \nYour question : `` Have the Western forces been prudent in their air strikes or shown disregard for civilian casualties ? '' \nshould have had the following choices : \\* Western forces have demonstrated care in avoiding civilian casualties during the airstrikes Western forces have shown disregard for civilian deaths Why should Western power take notice of this small African nation in turmoil ? \nIt is because of oil , not because of democrazy . \nIn any conflict , Western people are always the aggressors . \nHistory is the witness to this . \nYou know the truth is that it does n't end . \nOf course it does n't end as long as there are ruthless dictators like Gaddafi on the planet , and people who are willing to stand and fight . \nFor those of you who think we can just sit here and watch the stock market in the safety of our own nation , wake up . \nWe do n't control the world anymore , and the only reason we ever came close to doing it was that the rest of the world was bombed back into the middle ages after WW II . \nNow we are learning that unless we have that kind of a head start , we ca n't compete . \nIf we do n't start standing for Democracy again instead of big money , we will be a has-been in a very short time . \nThe big money is moving quickly to Asia , so now is the time to get back to our principles instead of our financial interests . \nThis exercise by the US , UK , and France has nothing to do with Gaddafi . \nWe do n't know exactly the reasons but it is not about a `` ruthless dictator . '' \nIf that were the case , we would have been bombing most of Africa and the middle east . \nUse your brains , people . \nAll of the arab nations even Saudi Arabia will be burning under the bombs of the US . \nThis is it boys the final battle between Muslims and Christians . \nIt 's the crusades all over again just like George W. Bush said when he invaded Iraq . \nMan your weapons the fight is going to Iran soon . \nWe should have used those resources to bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities and their mullahs . \nThey are the real threat to us . \nLibya was of no particular importance to us and was not a threat . \nThe rebels want us to do the heavy lifting so they can take over , but they will hate us as much as Qadaffi does . \nI must say , today 's comments here are some of the dumbest I 've seen in a long time ... If there had n't been airstrikes , Gaddafi was about to slaughter thousands , and then the chant would 've been `` Oh , the USA can go into countries that benefit them , but they let this slaughter happen , just like in Rwanda ! '' \nNow that the US has followed the request of the Arab League , African Org . \n, to stop a slaughter in a very limited engagement and the same accusations pop up . \nOne ca n't have it both ways ; accuse the international community of `` allowing '' slaughter to happen in Rwanda , then criticizing us for trying to stop it this time . \nAnd how about we wait for data on the ground to tell us whether US forces killed civilians and not take the King of Liars , Gaddafi 's word for it ? \nRussia and China 's playing both sides of the fence is getting EXTREMELY tiring at this point . \nI agree the USA should back away now that we 've dropped the air defenses , but I wanted to post here lamenting the extremely poor quality of the comments here today . \nBomb Gaddafi 's airforces and ammo dumps . \nAny military columns that appear from Gaddafi 's side . \nLet the rebels fight their way to freedom . \nThey are doing the heavy lifting -LRB- fighting and dying -RRB- . \nOur Air Forces and Navys are flying jets and pressing buttons . \nThis is the kind of war we should have brought to Iraq in 1991 . \nWe should have been protecting the citizens in the north and south when they tried to rebel against Hussein . \nWe should have protected them . \nIt would have been easier and cheaper than invading the country for a ground war the second time ' round . \nInstead the Republican President and his men told us stories about WMD . \nWhat the Republicans are doing now as a party to run inteference on Obama amounts to hypocrisy . \nI 'm sure if Obama did nothing then the Republicans would have roasted him for that too . \nThe Republicans have been completely counter-productive for the past 6-8 years . \nThey supported the people who took down our economy . \nTurned a blind eye . \nSpent our wealth on two unnecessary unproductive ground wars . \nNow they 've done everything they could to undermine our current president when our country needs all our leaders to make productive suggestions and carefully steer our country out of this economic quagmire . \nI supported them in previous elections but NEVER again . \nI 'll vote 3rd or 4th party if necessary . \nI 'll always vote against them . \nIf the West had n't gone in there would have been a brutal slaughter and the maniac would have still been in charge -LRB- recharged too -RRB- . \nHe would have cracked down that much harder on his own people . \nAll he had to do was step down . \nDuring all these protests in every case the gov ' ts have started shooting first . \nThey have started killing their own peoples , their own neighbors . \nLet 's help the Middle East leave the 6th century behind and join the 21st century . \nOur gov ' t also needs to quit funding these kinds of dictators -- see Yemen and Egypt for examples . \nWhile I do support the NATO action , I would rather see Quadaffi step down , with a Diplomatic soloution . \nthe Libyan civilians must be protected from both air and land . \nPerhaps UN blue helmets can be sent in to protect civilians from Quadaffi 's ground assault that cont . \nIf the Arab League of Nations , France , and the UK feel it is necessary to attack Libya then we should let them do so . \nQuadaffi must be stopped . \nHowever , who says the U.S. should have to lead or be involved ? \nWe are already fighting two wars and we can not afford a third . \nThese other countries have missiles and bombs , why the hell do n't they take care of it ? \nThese countries appear to have no conviction . \nThey want us to lead so they will have someone to blame if it does n't pan out the way they want it to . \nWe should have submitted our approval at the UN and then been done with it . \nWe , the United States , can not police the world . \nFor once I 'd like to see the Arab League of Nations take care of their own ! \nThey have the means to get rid of Quadaffi . \nNow they are criticizing us as usual . \nWhy do n't they just admit that they support the governing methods of Quadaffi and reveal their true colors . \nFrance and Britain need to step up if they really want to do something about this . \nWe should support them , short of being involved . \nGaddafi must be eliminated '' a la Saddam '' Gaddafi is a psychopath who abused Libya , had scores of innocent people in Libya , Europe , etc killed Gaddafi abused human rights for more than 41 years Like David Koresh or Rev Jones of Jonestown , he thinks he is a prophet ... . . \nhe has always overestimated himself ... . . \nnow he must go and let Libya live in peace and prosperity He dilapidated Libya 's resources for his own gratification . \nHe is a murderous dictator and must go now Obama opted for the lesser of two evils . \nAnd now he is working to minimize US exposure to the financial and geopolitical blowback by pressing to have allies carry the load for a change . \nAnd yes , those nations that believe democracy and freedom are what is best for people around the world should stand up and help defend those who would fight for it , no matter where they exist . \nYemen , Syria , Iran , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , anywhere . \nThis is n't about religion Mr. Putin and others who prefer the status quo , it is about one less dictatorship or theocratic regime in the world capable of supressing human rights , democracy , and personal freedoms ... including the right to worship as you choose , and to speak your minds as you choose , absent violent repression . \nSo where are all the people calling Obama a war criminal ? \nI guess it 's just criminal when a Republican is in office . \nOr I am to gather that finally people have woken up a bit to realize the world is better off without tyrants and that doing nothing really means supporting those tyrants actions ? \nThe difference between what happened in Egypt versus what happened in Libya is that Libyan citizens took up arms against their government . \nThe moment they did that , civil disobedience became a civil war . \nIt seems to me that deciding to support a military action like this is a low cost opportunity to pick up GW Bush 's baton in trying to encourage democracy to be adopted in the area . \nThere must be a strategic benefit or we would n't act . \nthis war is not about the freedom of Libyans . \nIt is all about controlling Libyan OIL . \nWhat about the democracy in Saudi Srabia -LRB- one of the most brutal regimes in the world -RRB- !! What about Bahrain ? \nThey wont do anything to these countries coz they already have the control over their OIL . \nAnd what about the other half of Libyans who support Gaddafi ? \nTheir opinion doesnt count ? \nWhy doesnt the west bomb China then , poor Tibetans , under brutal Chinese rule for more than 50 years ? \nCoz Tibet doesnt have any OIL that the west can not exploit . \nWhy no fly zone in Ivory Coast ... more people dead there than in Libya . \nIts so sad to see that western powers ignoring all these and expecting the people around the world believe their selfish reasoning . \nYou really gotta love these polls . \nYou got a majority supporting Obama 's cowardly air strikes , while at the same time , that same majority opposes sending in ground troops that can effectively end the whole situation immediately . \nPlease I pray to my GOD that we do not let this golden chance to take out this insane madman now that we have been given the green light to go for it pass us by ? \nRecently Ireland changed its government , in peaceful election . \nThe people voted to change a government that was damaging the interests of the people of Ireland . \nUntil the people in countries across the world want to vote to change their governments , dictators like Gadaffi and his ilk steal away peoples freedom and there precious lives . \nFreedom has to be taken by you , or is taken from you . \nGeorge W. Bush stated that the Iraq war was justified to free the Iraqi people and spread democracy . \nThat was a full invasion . \nNow we have potentially the whole Arab world doing exactly that -LRB- take matters in their own hand -RRB- and we do n't even want to give them aircover and drop some bombs ?? Come on people , stop the hypocrisy . \nHave you seen anyone burning US flags ? \nI have n't and I think that is a good thing for once . \nSo let 's give them a helping hand . \nThey may thank us . \nOther than that , we should stop buying their oil . \nNo oil , no money for their leaders\\/dictators . \nThe US Constitution demands that every US President obtain a Declaration of War from Congress unless the US is in imminent danger . \n-- - President Obama ignored Congress and went on a junket . \n-- - President Bush II was guilty of the same crimes and it 's a pity and an indictment of our society that he was n't impeached . \n-- - Just because we ` do n't like ' a foreign leader does not give our country the right or the moral imperitive to meddle offensively in their matters . \n-- - Having the UN front for our trespasses does n't make them right . \nWe were supposed to be in and out of Korea , Vietnam , Iraq , and Afghanistan . \nNone of these predictions came true . \nWe ca n't afford to be the world 's policeman . \nIt is interesting to read historical accounts of those actually subject to tyranny such as a Russian in a Stalin gulag and a Jew in Auschwitz both wished for the bombs to rain from the sky to release them from their hell on earth . \nThey did not care if they were killed in the process but at least it would be an indication fellow humanity was willing to fight to save them . \nAlas the Berlin wall came down to late for most and the Allies were not able to prevent the worst of the genocide against other by the German Nazi not only against Jews . \nAre we now to condemn these victims of tyranny to a similar fate as we sit on the side lines pontificating on how nasty war is and gee why don t they just sit down nicely and work it out ? \nIf we lived in pacifist fairy land great idea but we do not and never have . \nSo for those on the streets now of Africa and the Middle East bravely facing death unarmed or with comparatively less fire power than their rivals as in Libya . \nDo we once again forsake them because it is none of our business given they are other or do we realize finally we are as responsible for them and their families happiness as we are for our own ? \nOne day soon we may search vainly the sky and horizon for release from heavy chains or imminent destruction of all we love and cherish . \n100 cruise missiles shot over the first day or two alone at a reported $ 700,000 a piece -LRB- $ 70 million dollars for the first day alone -RRB- a downed fighter jet I would imagine is somewhere between $ 15 - $ 22 million dollars for a total of $ 92 million dollars and that 's just for a few different types of equipment during the first few days the tip of the ice berg that is n't counting all money it costs to move aircraft carriers , battle ships , fuel and everything else involved with this silliness . \nTo get some rebel fighters who no one knows who they are who appear to be hardcore muslim radicals -LRB- some interviewed said they did n't like Gaddafi because he was n't muslim enough -RRB- and may even have ties to al queda into power ? \nWhat a waste of American money , time and resources . \nNot good times for anyone any where in the world mostly brought on by greed around the world but at no time can any of us avoid an opportunity to support a democratic development where dictatorships have forever kept the world on edge and caste a dark shadow on human hope . \nAs weary tired and broke as we can be . . \nWe have to help those who are even more weary and tired of living but not living at all . \nWhat the hell happened to North Korea ? \nIn Libya , the opposition has guns . \nIn North Korea , the people are getting raped but are too brainwashed to realize . \nKim Jong-Il is literally starving his people while eating food from his 5-star chef ! \nSo let me get this straight . \nMost of Europe , and a good many Americans -- especially Obama -- decried our move to take out Saddam , but this is OK ? \nAside from the fact that Saddam owned - and used - chemical weapons , could 've taught Gaddafi a thing or two about killing his own people , Iraq is strategically positioned on the border of Iran and the Persian gulf . \nWhat in the world will taking out Gaddafi do for us ? \nAnd besides , do the Western leaders really believe they can `` sort of '' make war ? \nThe world has been feminized . \nOur leaders do n't have balls anymore -- and I 'm talking about the men ! \nWe have a thing which the artist Mel Chin has represented in full size and it has allegedly been dropped on civilians . \nIt is known as a Daisy Cutter , a ten-thousand pound bomb . \nIts name is a clue : it detonates above ground and for acres there will stand nothing taller than a Daisy . \nWe target and murder people often , and while I do not approve and I believe it is counterproductive , why is a mass murdering dictator given diplomatic immunity ? \nJust one at his last known address would either finish the problem , or demoralize the survivors . \nOne Daisy Cutter , not scattered strikes on private soldiers , would stop MoMo G. , and only two more would stop his sons . \nIf Saddam ever had and used chemical weapons , and at one time he did , he got them from US Taxpayers . \nWe bought them and gave them to him to use against Iran and the Kurds . \nWe stripped him of these weapons before the eight year idiot war was started by bush . \nbush lied , and we still have billions a week expense doing it . \nWe fund most of the dictators in the world . \nDemocracy will break out eventually , in spite of our efforts . \nDaisy Cut MoMo and let Libya try to get some democracy . \nWho is going to pay for the wars ? \nWe are already under water for national budget and also big deficit . \nI see no reason to pick up another `` easy '' war . \nThis will not benefit the cotry a a whole only the military industry . \nBy the way , congress did n't authorize the launch of airstike . \nIt is against constitution . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n"}

'' \nSoon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise . \n`` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' it said in a written reply to a query . \nIt also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping to up the pressure on Gaddafi . \nIn an interview published on Monday by the Algerian El Khabar newspaper , Saif al-Islam , a son of the Libyan leader , said his father 's administration was in talks with the French government . \nSpeaking from Tripoli , the newspaper quoted him as saying : `` The truth is that we are negotiating with France and not with the rebels . \n`` Our envoy to -LRB- Nicolas -RRB- Sarkozy said that the French president was very clear and told him ` We created the -LRB- rebel -RRB- council , and without our support , and money , and our weapons , the council would have never existed . \n`` France said : ` When we reach an agreement with you -LRB- Tripoli -RRB- , we will force the council to cease fire ' , '' he was quoted as saying . \nGaddafi has been holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41-year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government . \nWith no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance . \nSome member states are balking at the burden on their recession-hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough . \nBut even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation . \nStrains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on Friday when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting . \nThere was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . \nOn the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in the past week , but the fighting on Sunday underlined it would be a long slog . \nGaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who last week seized the village of Al-Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . \nAl-Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli . \nA rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters shells had been landing repeatedly over the past 24 hours from pro-Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east . \nBut he said : `` No one was hurt , thank God . '' \nDuring a 20-minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al-Qawalish , at least five shells landed . \nHowever , they did not appear to be well targeted . \nLibyan state television reported on Sunday that NATO forces had struck an `` educational institution '' in Tripoli . \nJamahiriyah Television quoted a military spokesman as saying there were `` human and material '' casualties in the air strike in the district of Tajoura , but gave no specific details . \nLibya has been convulsed by a civil war since February when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against Gaddafi 's rule . \nHundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al-Qawalish , another force of rebels is trying to push towards Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance . \nFighters from the rebel-held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress towards the capital . \nNATO launched its bombing campaign in March after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi . \nGaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants . \nHe has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil . \n"}

'' \nHe was forced to register her with the Arabic name Hala instead . \nFRIENDS ... FOR THE REVOLUTION Even the Berber name of the Nafusa mountain range was banned . \nOn Gaddafi 's maps , the region is known only as the Western Mountains . \nGaddafi 's government still uses hostility to the Amazigh as part of its propaganda , warning Arabs in nearby towns that Berbers are coming out of the hills to attack them . \nInside rebel-held territory , Arabs and Berbers say they are united . \nRebel units from Berber towns like Yefren and Jadu have been fighting side by side with units from Arab towns in the mountains , such as Zintan . \nAll fly the same pre-Gaddafi flag and profess similar goals of creating a democratic state . \nBut although they fight side by side , the units are still kept separate . \nWhen they captured the village of al-Qawalish last week , one of the first acts of the rival units was to hurriedly spray-paint the names of their Arab or Berber home towns on village walls . \nAn Arab rebel fighter in Zintan winced when this reporter referred to the Nafusa Mountains . \n`` Never say the Nafusa Mountains . \nThat 's what the Berbers call it . \nWe call it the Western Mountains , '' he said . \nBut are n't you all friends ? . \n`` We are friends for now , '' the fighter replied , pausing for a moment to consider . \n`` For the revolution . '' \nAnfusi acknowledges that hostility between Arabs and Berbers will probably outlast Gaddafi 's time in power . \n`` We will discover about each other . \nThis will need time . \nMaybe we need five years . \nMaybe ten years to build our country . \nThis is our opportunity , '' he said . \nBut in his own way , Gaddafi had inadvertently helped . \nThe Libyan leader 's crackdown on the rebellion this year had united the Arabs and Berbers of the mountains for the first time , Anfusi said . \n`` The people , they all hate Gaddafi .

{"id": "208", "time": "2011-08-05", "text": "LONDON | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 12:48 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mired in a slow-moving ground war , Libya 's warring parties are turning to propaganda to try to splinter each other 's support base and gain leverage in talks on a political settlement . \nMuammar Gaddafi is playing on fears among Libyans that Western-backed rebels will tip the country deeper into chaos . \nThe opposition 's message is that only an end to Gaddafi 's 41-year-old rule can bring peace , stability and justice . \nThe war of words is not new : Both sides took to the airwaves and the Internet within hours of the February start of a revolt against Gaddafi 's government . \nBut now international contacts are under way on a political solution , both sides are looking more urgently at psychological warfare to boost negotiating clout in the absence of a decisive military move in Libya 's deserts , mountains and towns . \nAn eye-catching example of the information struggle emerged on Wednesday when one of Gaddafi 's sons aired the possibility of an alliance with Islamist `` terrorists , '' a startling U-turn after the government 's previous insistence that its main enemy in the conflict was al Qaeda . \n`` Libya will look like Saudi Arabia , like Iran . \nSaif al-Islam told the New York Times , adding he would now form an alliance with Islamists among the rebels . \nSaif al-Islam has campaigned prominently for reconciliation with Islamist militants over the past five years , and helped arrange the release of hundreds of them from prison . \nBut the killing by Gaddafi loyalists of civilians in the 2011 uprising destroyed Saif al-Islam 's credibility with Islamists , analysts say . \nHis latest remarks were greeted with derision by a wide range of Libyan opposition commentators . \n`` It 's childish scare tactics , '' U.S.-based Libyan activist Hafed al-Ghwell told Reuters . \n`` The logic is , ` Let 's frighten the hell out of the West by suggesting we 'll ally with Islamists . ' '' \n`` He knows very well that if Islamists ever move on Tripoli , their first target will be Gaddafi and his family . '' \nAshour Shamis , a UK-based opposition activist and editor , said Islam 's remarks showed the Gaddafi camp was `` absolutely desperate . \nIt 's pathetic . '' \n`` They are clutching at straws , '' he said . \nNoman Benotman , a former opposition guerrilla commander who once worked closely with Saif al-Islam on his reconciliation program , said the government had started to work with some members of a highly conservative , apolitical group of Salafi Islamists in Tripoli to try to counter rebel influence . \nState television has also spoken vaguely of a possible Islamist tie-up . \nBenotman said , however , that Saif al-Islam 's claim of a link to Islamists working within the rebel camp were false and `` psychological warfare . '' \nBut if the purported Gaddafi-Islamist tie-up sounds outlandish , the rebels ' credibility is if anything more compromised . \nDespite weeks of sporadic gains on the ground and advances on the diplomatic arena , the rebels are on the defensive in the battle for Libyan hearts and minds as never before following the unexplained death on July 28 of their military leader Abdel Fattah Younes . \nHis killing has drawn attention to rifts in the rebel camp , an assortment of armed groups that , especially in the east , has struggled to project an image of unity -LRB- ID : nLDE7731AF -RRB- Younes 's family has criticised the handling of the murky case by the rebel National Transitional Council and said it might take justice into its own hands unless rebel leaders come clean over exactly who killed him . \nA propaganda gift to Gaddafi , the killing has raised concerns over instability and sustained trouble even if the opposition ousts the veteran leader . \nGADDAFI POINTS TO EGYPT , TUNISIA UNREST Worries are running so deep that when a rebel spokesman on Friday reported the death of another of Gaddafi 's sons , Khamis , Libya-watchers immediately suspected it was a propaganda ploy to distract attention from Saif al-Islam 's New York Times interview , which received wide attention in the Arab world . \n`` It 's probably just propaganda , '' one Libya analyst said . \n`` It looks a bit desperate . '' \nThe report was denied with hours by a Gaddafi spokesman . \nApparently buoyed by Younes 's death , Saif al-Islam on Aug 2 seemed to remove a government offer of ceasefire talks if NATO stopped bombing , saying regardless of whether NATO disengaged from Libya , the war would continue until all Libya was freed . \nPointing to post-revolution unrest in Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi said in a July 23 audio address that the uprisings there had resulted in looting and destruction . \nThe message may well have been intended for a local audience , analysts say . \nGaddafi in June posed playing chess with a senior Russian chess player , looking relaxed and focus . \nAl-Ghwell , the U.S.-based Libya activist , said he worried that the ousting of Gaddafi was taking such a long time , although he was confident the rebels would eventually win . \n`` The fact is that the longer this lasts the more likely we 'll have more incidents like the killing of Younes and the more likely we 'll have a messy situation in general .

there is no other explanation , '' neighbor Atiya Mohamed shouted as he stood among the rubble that was Marabit 's home . \nYet NATO and the rebels hoping to seize Zlitan and eventually capture the fortified capital will likely portray it as more evidence of Gaddafi stationing civilians at military sites as he seeks to avoid further damage to his fighting prowess . \nThe Gaddafi government routinely reports deaths inflicted by NATO airstrikes , whose victims it calls ` martyrs , ' but Thursday 's events marked the first time in weeks officials had offered details of the identities of those it said were killed by NATO bombs . \nIt was also the first time in weeks it had offered journalists an opportunity to report on human victims of airstrikes at close range . \nAfter the attack , NATO acknowledged it had hit a military command site in the area around 6:30 a.m. , approximately the time officials and neighbors said Marabit 's house was struck . \n`` We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it , but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike , '' a NATO official in Naples said . \nWhile there was no evidence of any military activity among the shattered cinderblock and cushions strewn around Marabit 's destroyed home , rebels fighting for control of Zlitan raised questions about the building 's true use . \nIf confirmed , the attack near Zlitan would not be the first time since Western-led airstrikes began in Libya in late March that NATO activity has resulted in civilian deaths . \nIn June , NATO admitted it destroyed a house in Tripoli in which Libyan officials said nine civilians were killed . \nShortly afterwards , the Libyan government reported almost 20 people were killed in a strike on the home of a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . \nMore such incidents could undermine support for a campaign already on shaky ground in some NATO nations , where financial pressures have added to doubts about a campaign that has yet to bring peace in Libya . \nLibyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the incident would stoke anti-Western rage . \n`` What NATO is doing is very dangerous . \nIt is planting the seeds of hatred in the hearts of millions of Libyans , '' he said . \nResidents of Zlitan and Souq al-Jumaa , on the town 's western outskirts , brushed aside rebel claims this week Gaddafi 's opponents were on the cusp of capturing the town . \nZlitan was quiet as foreign journalists toured the center of the town on Thursday afternoon , as fasting Muslims rested or stayed indoors due to the heat . \nBut the silence was interrupted regularly by the thuds of shelling or rocket attacks just to the east . \nGovernment minders took journalists to see several other sites apparently hit by NATO strikes , including a large school and the local law college , where among rubble and law books lay empty ammunition boxes and green military clothing in the dirt . \nMohamed Salim , minding a deserted toy store , said some Zlitan residents had fled and power cuts had become more frequent as fighting had increased in the past few weeks . \nBut he said he was n't afraid of the advance of rebels . \n`` I only fear god , '' he said . \n-LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Sophie Hares -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

production at Wafa is also restarted . \n\\* The Bouri field will restart production of both oil and gas by the end of the month . \n\\* AGOCO 's eastern fields of Sarir and Mesla are currently pumping , with traders noting that the first cargo of crude to ship to Asia from Libya was probably Sarir . \n\\* Hamada : Smaller fields like the 15,000 bpd Hamada field will resume production within days , Berouin said , while Nafoora was due to restart on October 5 and Beda on the 15 . \n\\* Waha Oil 's Waha and Samah fields are currently not safe , while Gialo suffered a great degree of damage , according to company officials . \n\\* No information has yet emerged on the state of fields such as Dahra , Nasser or Raguba , Beida or Intisar among others . \n\\* In September , two cargoes of crude oil were exported for Tesoro and Conoco refineries and a third one was sent to Zawiyah refinery for domestic needs , easing the cost of purchasing fuel on the spot market . \n\\* `` Some of the oil is going to internal refiners so it will still be a while before we see a real push on exports , '' said Olivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix . \n\\* A third cargo of condensate , sold to Austrian oil and gas company OMV in early October , was deliveried to the Italian port of Trieste loaded from storage tanks filled prior to the war , Berouin said . \n\\* The same month , European trading company Gunvor booked oil tanker Wilmina to load 950,000 barrels of Libyan crude , according to shipping fixtures . \nThe destination was given as east of Suez , which traders said meant it was likely heading to China . \n\\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials in July forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \n\\* The chairman of the NOC Nouir Berouin reiterated that it could take up to 15 months for output to return to pre-war levels , although many analysts have been surprised by the speed with which operations have resumed . \n\\* Consultants Petroleum Policy Intelligence estimated that output could reach 1 million bpd by the end of November . \n\\* FACTS Energy analysts expects Libyan crude production to rise to 800,000 bpd by the end of this year and to return to the pre-crisis level of 1.6 million bpd by end-2012 . \n\\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it would take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . \nIt estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . \nBut the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \n\\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \n\\* `` The ramp-up stage -LRB- of oil production -RRB- is where quick decision-making will be needed most and where the recovery could be derailed from the very good pace at which is has initially picked up , '' said Ciszuk . \n`` We said from the beginning the main challenge might be the ramp-up , rather than the re-start so most of that is still to be seen . '' \n\\* In August , the longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . \nHe said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \n\\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \n\\* The NOC plans to resume marketing within the next month , although some subsidiaries have expressed resistance to the idea of an all-powerful NOC . \nThe future division of responsibilities between the NOC and the oil and finance ministry , headed by Ali Tarhouni , is unclear . \nEarlier plans to form a separate oil ministry for shaping policy appear to be floundering . \n\\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \n\\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . \nIts contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \n\\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . \nThe legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified . \nThe table below is based on previous data from consultancy IHS Herold and Reuters reports : -LRB- Reporting by Christopher Johnson and Zaida Espana ; Editing by William Hardy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAsked if it was possible to hold talks if Gaddafi had not stepped down , Longuet said : `` He will be in another room in his palace with another title . '' \nSoon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise . \n`` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' the department said in a written reply to a query . \nIt also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping ratchet up the pressure on Gaddafi . \nGaddafi has been defiantly holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41-year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government . \nWith no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance . \nSome member states are balking at the burden on their recession-hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough . \nBut even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation . \nStrains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on Friday when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting . \nThere was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . \nOn the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in the past week , but the fighting on Sunday underlined it would a long slog . \nGaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who last week seized the village of Al-Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli . \nAl-Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli . \nA rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters that shells had been landing repeatedly over the past 24 hours from pro-Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east . \nBut he said : `` No one was hurt , thank God . '' \nDuring a 20-minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al-Qawalish , at least five shells landed . \nHowever , they did not appear to be well targeted , striking random spots in the nearby hills . \nLibya has been convulsed by a civil war since February when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against his 41-year-rule . \nThat rebellion has now turned into the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping the region . \nGaddafi sounded a new note of defiance on Friday . \nIn an audio recording broadcast on state television , he threatened to export the war to Europe in revenge for the NATO-led military campaign against him . \n`` Hundreds of Libyans will martyr in Europe . \nI told you it is eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth , '' he said . \n`` You will regret it , NATO , when the war moves to Europe . '' \nHundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al-Qawalish , another force of rebels is also trying to push toward Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance . \nFighters from the rebel-held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress toward the capital . \nA spokesman for insurgents who are behind the pro-Gaddafi lines and inside Zlitan itself , said they had mounted their second attack on government troops in a week . \n`` The revolutionaries inside the town of Zlitan shelled the -LRB- pro-Gaddafi -RRB- brigades positioned on the coastal road on Sunday at 1:00 a.m. -LRB- 2300 GMT -RRB- , killing at least seven people , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from Zlitan . \nThe account could not be verified independently because journalists have not been able to reach the town . \nNATO launched its bombing campaign in March after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi . \nGaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants . \nHe has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHey rebels you should never have trusted the old colonial powers . \nThey just wanted to stop the flow of oil to get the price up for the real powers which is the big money that owns the oil of the world . \nYou should have expected that the french would get you killed in large numbers and do nothing for you . \nUS position is simply for Obama to save face . \nHis unwise , untimely call for regime change inserted the USA into the domestic politics of Libya ... for no reason . \nLibya 's government if for Libyans to determine , not Barak H. Obama ! \nThey were the very first to help the Libyan citizens fighting for their very lives and family members when Kadhafi began slaughtering them . \nNow that the Libyan citizens are on the offensive , the French tell the Libyan citizens to make peace with Khadafi . \nThe French politicians should put themselves in the mental shoes of those Libyans that have lost mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters , neighbors , and friends because Kadhafi the `` King of Kings , '' declared war on his own citizens . \nJustice for the Libyan citizens will not be achieved until Kadhafi and his Nazi goons are dead or imprisoned for life . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "23", "time": "2011-03-20", "text": "TRIPOLI | Sun Mar 20 , 2011 7:55 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western powers pressed ahead on Sunday with a campaign of air attacks in Libya , promising more strikes despite criticism by the Arab League . \nU.S. military officials said Saturday 's strikes had halted an advance by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern rebel stronghold Benghazi and hit his air defenses , allowing western powers to send in planes to impose a no-fly zone . \nBut the day-old U.N.-mandated military intervention to force Gaddafi 's troops to end attacks on civilians hit a diplomatic setback when the Arab League chief questioned the bombardment . \n`` What is happening in Libya differs from the aim of imposing a no-fly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , '' Egypt 's state news agency quoted Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as saying . \nGaddafi himself said the air strikes amounted to terrorism and vowed to fight to the death , although at 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB- on Sunday an armed forces spokesman said the army was ordering all troops to cease fire immediately . \nThe United States and Britain , who along with France , Italy and Canada have joined operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' dismissed the ceasefire announcement , arguing that Gaddafi 's government had promised and then broken a ceasefire on Friday . \nIn central Benghazi , sporadic explosions and heavy firing could be heard in the streets late in the evening . \nA Reuters witness said the firing lasted about 40 minutes . \nResidents had said they feared some of Gaddafi 's troops could try to force their way into the city , where they would be surrounded by civilians and protected from attacks from the air . \nOutside Benghazi , the advance by Gaddafi 's troops was stopped in its tracks , with smoldering , shattered tanks and troop carriers littering the main road . \nThe charred bodies of at least 14 government soldiers lay scattered in the desert . \nHowever , government tanks did move into Misrata , the last rebel-held city in western Libya , seeking the shelter of built-up areas after a base used by Gaddafi 's forces outside was hit by Western air strikes , residents said . \nAbdelbasset , a spokesman for the rebels in Misrata , told Reuters : `` There is fighting between the rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . \nTheir tanks are in the center of Misrata ... There are so many casualties we can not count them . '' \nA Libyan government health official said 64 people had been killed in the Western bombardment overnight from Saturday to Sunday , but it was impossible to verify the report . \nThe Arab League 's Moussa called for an emergency meeting of the group of 22 states to discuss Libya . \nHe requested a report into the bombardment , which he said had `` led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians . '' \nArab backing for a no-fly zone provided crucial underpinning for the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution last week that paved the way for Western action to stop Gaddafi killing civilians as he fights an uprising against his rule . \nThe intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . \nWithdrawal of Arab support would make it much harder to pursue what some defense analysts say could in any case be a difficult , open-ended campaign with an uncertain outcome . \nBritain and the United States rebuffed Moussa 's comments . \nA senior U.S. official said a U.N. resolution endorsed by Arab states covered `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , `` which we made very clear includes , but goes beyond , a no-fly zone . '' \nThe safe enforcement of the no-fly zone required the targeting of Libya 's air defense capabilities , a British Foreign Ministry spokesman said . \nA spokesman for the rebel movement criticized Moussa 's comments , telling Al Jazeera that more than 8,000 Libyans aligned with the rebel movement had been killed . \n`` Today , when the secretary-general spoke , I was surprised , '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said . \n`` What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya , what is the mechanism , Mr Secretary-General ? \nIf the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation , what is the mechanism that you propose to us ? '' \nThe U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the no-fly zone was now in place . \nBut he told CBS television the endgame of military action was `` very uncertain '' and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi . \nMullen said he had seen no reports of civilian casualties from the Western strikes . \nBut Russia said there had been such casualties and called on Britain , France and the United States to halt the `` non-selective use of force . '' \nLibyan state television showed footage from an unidentified hospital of what it called victims of the `` colonial enemy .

{"id": "94", "time": "2011-03-18", "text": "BRUSSELS | Fri Mar 18 , 2011 12:45 pm EDT BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Western and Arab military campaign against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi could be launched within hours and cripple his forces -- perhaps drive him from power -- within weeks . \nBut it is not without risks . \nThursday 's U.N. Security Council vote backing military action in Libya offers intervening powers a very broad mandate , by authorizing `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . \nIt is unclear how far the allies want to go , notably in view of Gaddafi 's initial response of offering a ceasefire . \nBut it is clear their firepower gives them many possibilities . \nMilitary analysts said the resolution could mean a campaign extending beyond simply preventing government planes operating in a no-fly zone around Benghazi and other rebel-held areas and might be expected to include strikes against air bases , missile sites , command centers , heavy artillery units and tanks . \nThey said a coalition led by Britain and France and backed by the United States and Arab countries would be able to deploy formidable air capabilities -- including French Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighters , British Typhoon and Tornado strike aircraft and U.S. F-22s -- against Gaddafi 's fairly ragged resources . \n`` The terms of the resolution are very wide-ranging , '' said Shashank Joshi at London 's Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- , suggesting it could lead to overthrowing Gaddafi . \n`` Over time we may not just see bombing of units close to Benghazi ; we may see powers saying we are authorized to remove this threat . '' \nThe air armada would be backed by airborne early-warning and tanker aircraft and British Nimrod spy planes , against a Libyan air force that may be able to field as few as 40 of its notional combat strength of 200-plus aircraft , said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies . \nAnalysts said the attackers could use a broad range of bases across southern Europe , including in Italy , British bases in Cyprus and Gibraltar and French bases in Corsica and southern France -- as well as , potentially , bases in Gulf states . \nA French official said the operation could also involve missiles fired from warships in the Mediterranean . \nBarak Seener , a Middle East expert at RUSI said the Libyan armed forces would be able to put up little contest : `` I would give it a month , '' he said . \n`` It will be striking targets of the regime and it will be rapidly eroding the regime 's command and control . \nI do n't see this as a time-consuming exercise . '' \nSeener said Western forces , sticking to U.N. instructions not to invade , would seek to turn the war decisively against Gaddafi by aiding the nearly defeated rebels . \nThey would supply them with communication equipment , anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and also send special forces to train their troops . \n`` And they will use the no-fly zone to offer the opposition intelligence on the regime 's movements and force concentrations , '' he said , painting a picture of a decisive intervention on the hitherto losing side in Libya 's civil war . \nSeener said that as well as the Rafale , a multi-purpose strike aircraft , France could use the Super Etendard , a carrier-borne strike fighter supported by VC-10 and C-135 FR refueling tankers and AWACS reconnaissance aircraft . \nHe said France would have about 30 carrier-based aircraft available , while the United State had indicated it would only use land-based aircraft . \nThese may come from Italy . \nFrench aircraft could also fly out of land bases in mainland France and Corsica and from Italy , 500-1 ,400 km from Tripoli . \nBritain , meanwhile would employ Tornado GR4s , Typhoons and air-to-air refueling and surveillance aircraft , while Canada is sending six CF-18 Hornets . \nSaudi Arabia , which has Tornados , F-15s and Typhoons , and other Arabs states -- the UAE and Qatar -- would probably provide a token number of aircraft , he said . \n`` The first ground strikes will be carried out by Rafales , Mirage 2000Ds and Tornado GR4s , firing precision weapons -- laser-guided bombs , GPS guided -LRB- A2SM -RRB- and Scalp or Storm Shadow missiles , '' he said . \n`` The bombers will be escorted by fighters to protect them and go after any Libyan planes sent to intercept . '' \nJoshi said that because the rebels lacked the power to topple Gaddafi militarily the allies ' strategy would have to be based on first removing his ability to threaten Benghazi , then a combination of political and military pressure . \n`` The hope will be that there will either be a coup or disintegration of the regime from the top , '' he said . \nWhile analysts forecast that first strikes against Gaddafi could be launched in the next day or two -- possibly as early as Saturday , when Arab and Western leaders are scheduled to meet in Paris -- some analysts cautioned it could be too late to avoid a messy partition of the country . \n`` It looks like Gaddafi will stay in power in Tripoli for some time to come and a form of stalemate will emerge , bringing a partition between the east and west , '' said Henry Wilkinson of the Janusian Security Consultants . \nJoshi said it was hard to predict how long the campaign would last , but noted that the NATO operation in Kosovo in 1999 , which was forecast to take weeks , had dragged on for months . \n`` There 's no guarantee , '' he said . \n`` Gaddafi could pull back to Sirte and make clear he 's no longer threatening Benghazi and put the coalition in a position of having to decide whether to bomb him there , which could look like a provocative act . \n`` So it could result in stalemate that could go on for months . \nAnd the longer it goes on the more Arab public opinion will go against it , because you will see creeping civilian casualties , and the more you will see this coalition , which is a very artificial thing , slowly fracture . '' \nAnalysts also pointed to the potential costs of a long drawn out campaign , at a time of economic crisis and austerity . \nWhile an initial air campaign could be launched with `` tens of aircraft , '' Joshi said , it was eventually likely to have to involve hundreds and cost in excess of $ 100 million a week . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nYet there is no international consensus on robust action . \nJudging by Thursday 's meetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- , the African Union and NATO , none will emerge soon . \nEuropean Union leaders were meeting on Friday to discuss Libya . \nMany fear mission creep if , say , a no-fly zone were imposed . \n`` What happens if it is not the Libyan air force that is gaining ground , but their armor ... and heavy artillery ? '' \nasked Timur Goksel , a former U.N. peacekeeping adviser in Beirut . \n`` Then what do you do , attack those ? \nBecause that 's not a no-fly zone , it 's war . \nIt 's a very complicated decision . \nThe Western countries have to think very hard , '' Goksel said . \nFor all their anti-Gaddafi rhetoric , Western powers are wary of plunging into another conflict in a Muslim nation in the absence of any simple way to remove a leader bent on survival . \nThe United States is hamstrung by its costly and contentious military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nRussia and China , along with Arab nations such as Algeria and Syria , are queasy about any precedent for meddling in another country 's affairs . \nSo it is hard to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize military action -- no-fly zones or sending military advisers or weapons to rebels are arguably acts of war -- and no nation or alliance is yet ready to step in without such approval . \nThe International Crisis Group has argued instead for a ceasefire and negotiations to end a burgeoning Libyan civil war . \n`` Western calls for military intervention of one kind or another are perilous and potentially counter-productive . \nThere are no quick or easy fixes , '' the conflict resolution group says . \n`` Insisting that Gaddafi step down will not make it happen . \nImposing a no-fly zone , bombing airfields or arming the rebels could tilt the balance of power in the rebels ' favor , but is unlikely to swiftly bring down the regime . '' \nThe African Union , rejecting any military intervention , plans to send five heads of state to Libya to seek a truce . \nThe Arab League has suspended Libya 's membership . \nSaudi Arabia and its five partners in the GCC have voiced support for a no-fly zone and declared Gaddafi 's rule illegitimate . \nThe Arab League was due to meet in Cairo on Saturday and officials said it would not let a delegation from Tripoli attend . \nBut decisive action from the League would be a surprise . \n`` The Arab League has become an entirely emasculated body that is essentially capable of doing nothing except rhetoric and speeches , '' said Karim Makdisi , who teaches international relations at the American University of Beirut -LRB- AUB -RRB- . \nHe said most Arab regimes remained intact despite the overthrow of leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and popular unrest against others . \nNone of them wanted the Arab League to lead the way in intervening against the government of a member state . \nNATO is also skittish about proposals to crimp Gaddafi 's military with a no-fly zone . \nThis would require evidence of war crimes against civilians , a clear legal basis and firm regional support , said its secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasumussen . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has signaled that her country will not go solo in imposing a no-fly zone on Libya . \n`` Absent international authorization , the United States acting alone would be stepping into a situation whose consequences are unforeseeable , '' she said on Thursday , belittling the effect of past no-fly zones in Iraq and Serbia . \nGaddafi , like Iraq 's Saddam Hussein , would portray any Western intervention as a selfish , colonial venture -- rhetoric that for many Arabs is grounded in decades of bitter reality . \n`` What we fear most is this European and Western eagerness to take control of Libya 's oil , '' said Omar Nashabe , an editor at Beirut 's al-Akhbar newspaper , which is sympathetic to Hezbollah . \nMany Arabs feel outraged by Gaddafi 's bloody strikes against his foes , but might also mistrust Western action , especially if an air embargo produced unintended civilian casualties . \n`` There is no belief that U.S. intervention will be brief , in the interests of Arabs , or serve the interests of stability , '' said AUB 's Makdisi . \nMany Arabs would see it as oil-motivated or as a U.S. bid to get ahead of the curve after failing to respond adequately to the pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and Tunisia . \n`` The wider context is the abysmal failure of the Obama administration to have any coherent U.S. policy toward the Middle East , '' Makdisi said , citing its past support for Arab strongmen and its ill-starred Israeli-Palestinian peace drive . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nNATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . \nCivil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . \nStalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . \nBut such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratization but insists he stay in power . \nIn a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . \nRebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . \nOilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nThe Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . \nU.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . \n`` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . \nThe head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day . '' \nJuppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' \nBut General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . \n`` Day by day people are dying . \nHundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . \nPatience has its limits , '' he said . \nAsked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . \nNATO has other means . \nI requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . \nThese damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' \nLibyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . \nAccounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . \nRebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . \nSpokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . \nThe ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed . '' \nNATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . \nRelieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . \n`` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . \nGaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . \nMisrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . \n`` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . \nMortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . \n`` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' \nMeanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . \n`` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . \nMost people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . \nPeople are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . \nThe upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' \nOn the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . \nIll-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . \nRebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . \nRebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' \n-LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . \n`` There have been no air strikes . \nWe hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . \n`` What is NATO waiting for ? \nWe have cities being destroyed . \nRas Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nYounes needs to stop the politics game playing with NATO . \nLet s look at the facts . \nNATO , as requested , has taken command for operations in the Libyan theater . \nHaving assumed control it is apparent NATO is interpreting the requirement to protect civilians in a narrower vein to of the coalition ; that is NATO acts where there is an imminent danger to the unarmed civilian population , as opposed to initiating pre-emptive strikes against Qaddafi forces . \nRegrettably much as the West fears and seeks to avoid civilian deaths it is unavoidable . \nThe truth is that as a rule , in any conflict civilians will die . \nWe continue to lie to ourselves and the public by perpetuating the lie . \nThe best that any force can hope to achieve is to limit as far as possible the loss of innocent life . \nInstead of blaming NATO for civilian deaths , Younes needs to question the position of the opposition for the safety of innocent civilians . \nIf he truly believes what he professes , that is , that his first priority is the unarmed civilian population , then he as leader of the opposition should call a halt to operations . \nIf on the other hand , his aim is free and open representative government for the people , then his needs to recognize the reality of the situation on the ground , and work with NATO to minimize casualties , as opposed to undermining the NATO effort . \nWhere is the United States , The Airforce pilots are better trained then other pilots around the world . \nA lot of Pilots around the world apply for trainning in the United States . \nAs for the disaster that is going on in Misrata , `` DAFFY '' should n't be allowed to go off into exile . \nThat Sick Person -LRB- DAFFY -RRB- should be bought before the World Courts and found guilty , Then Hung by the neck until very dead , the only problem is this faith is an easy way for all the killings over 42 year that him and his sons commited for there amussment . \nAlso , Hang his Sons . \nBack to Misrata , United States how long are you going to sit on the side lines while the Blood of Misrata is stainning our Flag . \nGet back into the fight , you know that we can make a differents . \nThe USA just ca n't win . \nIf we bomb Gaddafi 's military and accidentally hit civilians -LRB- who were allegedly placed near military targets by the enemy -RRB- we are evil and careless ; if we do n't bomb them we are n't helping out even though we `` should '' . \nWhen we hand over operations to NATO , people complain that they do n't blow stuff up as efficiently as we had been doing . \nMeanwhile , it 's our taxes paying for most of this , during a time when the Federal government is close to shutting down for lack of funds due to them being wasteful and inefficient . \nI am glad that we threw our UN vote towards helping the rebels , but I wish we were less gung-ho about sending our military around the world . \nI have a bad feeling that my taxes are going to pay for rebuilding yet another foreign country instead of paying off our national debt or -LRB- gasp -RRB- improving our own situation . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "160", "time": "2011-07-21", "text": "LONDON | Thu Jul 21 , 2011 1:05 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Military pressure alone may not end Libya 's war , but neither is diplomacy proving to be the fast track to peace that impatient Western powers had hoped . \nIneptly deployed , it may even put a brake on the deal-making a resolution will almost certainly require , analysts say . \nJust how slippery the political track has become for the West emerged on Wednesday , when France , a leading nation in the coalition attacking Gaddafi 's forces , said the Libyan leader could remain in the country if he relinquished power . \nThe idea floated by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe will be anathema to many in the rebel opposition who insist Gaddafi not only end his 41-year-old rule but also leave the country . \nThe notion also looks at odds with a Gaddafi arrest warrant issued by The Hague court for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by state forces against civilian demonstrators . \nPerhaps most starkly of all , Juppe 's remark shows how far Gaddafi 's resilience has diluted Western ambitions five months after the start of an anti-government revolt and four months after NATO began air strikes . \nThen , back on February 24 , Juppe , echoing the aspirations of officials in many Western states , said : `` I hope wholeheartedly Gaddafi is living his last moments as leader . '' \nThe more modest the West 's expectations , the better the deal Gaddafi may eventually be able to strike . \nForeign powers are eager for a rapid end to hostilities , because they want the oil-exporting nation of 6 million to emerge as a stable democracy rather than fall prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or become a haven for Islamist militants -- both outcomes a prolonged conflict might produce . \nBut the remarks by Juppe , the first senior Western official to express the Gaddafi-can-stay option in such a direct manner , will `` give great comfort '' to the leader , said Jon Marks , a veteran Libya watcher and chairman of Cross Border Information , a UK-based consultancy . \nIt would encourage the Colonel in a belief that he can widen rifts within the international community by stringing out talks with Western powers on a potential exit strategy , he said . \nOpposition activist and journalist Ashour Shamis said it was impossible to imagine Gaddafi , a proven survivor who ruled for years under sanctions , remaining in Libya in retirement `` keeping quiet and not making trouble . '' \n`` In his mind he is Libya and therefore has the natural right to intervene . \nSo this idea of Gaddafi staying in the country undermines the whole project -LRB- or reaching a workable solution -RRB- . '' \n`` It will create more problems than it solves . '' \nWestern officials have said they are receiving continual approaches by Libyan officials expressing contradictory messages on how to bring peace to the country . \nSome indicate a willingness to step down and help with transitional elections . \nBut on the record , Gaddafi appears defiant . \nEarlier this month he even threatened to take the war to Europe . \nHis foreign minister , Abdelati Obeidi , said on Wednesday that the government was not in any discussions about Gaddafi 's potential departure from power . \nAs a result of the mixed messages , no one appears sure whether Gaddafi intends to fight in hope of keeping his grip on the territory around Tripoli or seek an exit strategy that guarantees security for himself and his family . \nGaddafi is under huge pressure from dwindling fuel supplies and a broadening network of diplomatic acceptance of the rebels , notably Washington 's July 15 recognition of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council as Libya 's government . \n`` The colonel 's best hope of survival is for a large-scale fallout between NATO members and a scaling back or cessation of air strikes , '' a briefing by risk analysis firm Maplecroft said . \n`` This , however , is unlikely to occur in the near term . \nAs such , the noose continues to tighten around Gaddafi . '' \nBut Oliver Miles , a former British ambassador to Libya , said behind-the-scenes contacts had clearly not clinched agreement about Gaddafi 's evident desire to stay in Libya . \n`` There 's no real indication that that difference has been bridged yet . '' \nSome analysts say Gaddafi is not likely to embrace the notion of asylum in a third country , even if the U.N. Security Council voted to give him immunity from prosecution . \nUppermost in the minds of Gaddafi 's aides , Miles said , was the case of former Liberian President Charles Taylor , who was arrested in March 2006 for crimes committed in Sierra Leone 's 1991-2002 civil war . \nTaylor was in exile in Nigeria from 2003 until March 2006 , when he briefly disappeared before Nigerian police arrested him at a remote border post as he tried to flee into Cameroon . \n`` The version of the Charles Taylor story that seems to be believed in Libya is that he was given assurances of asylum by the Nigerians and they welshed on this and handed him over to the court , '' Miles said . \n`` That must be in anyone 's mind if they are thinking in terms of asylum in Africa .

{"id": "128", "time": "2011-03-29", "text": "TRIPOLI | Tue Mar 29 , 2011 7:12 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi 's better armed and organized troops reversed the rapid westward advance of rebels on Tuesday as world powers meeting in London piled pressure on the Libyan leader to step down . \nA conference of 40 governments and international bodies agreed to press on with a NATO-led aerial bombardment of Libyan forces until Gaddafi complied with a U.N. resolution to end violence against civilians . \nIt also set up a contact group comprising 20 countries and organizations , including Arab states , the African Union and the Arab League , to coordinate international support for an orderly transition to democracy in Libya . \n`` All of us must continue to increase the pressure on and deepen the isolation of the Gaddafi regime through other means as well , '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said after the London talks finished . \n`` This includes a unified front of political and diplomatic pressure that makes clear to Gaddafi that he must go . '' \nThe United States , Britain and Qatar suggested that Gaddafi and his family could be allowed to go into exile if they took up the offer quickly to end six weeks of bloodshed . \nWashington and Paris also raised the possibility of arming the rebels , although both stressed no decision had been taken . \nHowever , U.S. President Barack Obama told NBC television that he had already agreed to provide aid such as communications equipment , medical supplies and potentially transportation aid to the Libyan opposition , but no military hardware . \nWithout the help of air strikes , the rebels seem unable to make advances or even hold positions , and on the ground the pendulum of fighting swung back Gaddafi 's way . \nIt took five days of foreign air strikes to pulverize Libyan government tanks around the town of Ajdabiyah before Gaddafi 's troops fled and the rebels rushed in and began a 300-km -LRB- 200-mile -RRB- , two-day dash across the desert to within 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- of the Gaddafi loyalist stronghold of Sirte . \nBut the rebel pick-up truck cavalcade was first ambushed , then outflanked by Gaddafi troops . \nGovernment forces retook the small town of Nawfaliyah , 120 km -LRB- 75 miles -RRB- east of Sirte , and rebels said they had been pushed back a further 25 km -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- to the outskirts of the larger Bin Jawad . \n`` The Gaddafi guys hit us with Grads -LRB- rockets -RRB- and they came round our flanks , '' Ashraf Mohammed , a 28-year-old rebel wearing a bandolier of bullets , told a Reuters reporter at the front . \nAs the onslaught began , rebels leapt behind sand dunes to fire back . \nAfter a few minutes they gave up , jumped into their pick-up trucks and sped off back toward Bin Jawad . \nReports that some Nawfaliyah residents fought alongside government troops were an ominous sign for world powers hoping to end Gaddafi 's rule without a descent into all-out civil war . \nIn western Libya , rebels and forces loyal to Gaddafi both claimed control over parts of Misrata , Libya 's third city , which has been besieged by government forces for more than a month . \nState television said thousands of people were taking part in a march in support of Gaddafi in Misrata , which it said had been `` cleansed of armed terrorist gangs . '' \nIt was the third time the channel said Misrata had been recaptured from rebels . \nA rebel spokesman called Sami said Gaddafi 's forces had tried to enter the town from the east . \n`` Fighting is still taking place now . \nRandom bombardment is continuing , '' he told Reuters by telephone from the city . \n`` The humanitarian situation is catastrophic . \nThere is a shortage of food and medicine . \nThe hospital is no longer able to deal with the situation . '' \nAid agencies are increasingly worried about a lack of food and medicines , especially in towns such as Misrata where a siege by Gaddafi 's forces deprives them of access . \n`` It is difficult to even get water in from wells outside the town because of the positions of the forces , '' said Abdulrahman , a resident of Zintan in the west , cut off by pro-Gaddafi forces . \nThe U.N. refugee agency said it had reports of thousands of families living in makeshift shelters cut off from assistance . \nProtection of civilians remains the most urgent goal of the air strikes , and British Prime Minister David Cameron accused Gaddafi 's supporters of `` murderous attacks '' on Misrata . \nA series of powerful explosions rocked Tripoli on Tuesday and state television said several targets in the Libyan capital had come under attack in rare daytime strikes . \nThe Pentagon said 115 strike sorties had been flown against Gaddafi 's forces in the last 24 hours , and 22 Tomahawk cruise missiles had been fired . \nThe United States is scaling back to a `` supporting role '' to let NATO take full command of the air campaign from U.S. forces on Wednesday , but air strikes by U.S. , French and British planes remain key to smashing Gaddafi 's armor . \nObama told NBC that military pressure and international sanctions had `` greatly weakened '' Gaddafi , adding : `` He does not have control over most of Libya at this point . '' \nWashington says it has seen no evidence of civilian casualties of the bombardment , but Gaddafi accused Western powers of massacres of Libyan civilians in alliance with rebels who he said were al Qaeda members . \n`` Stop your brutal and unjust attack on our country ... Hundreds of Libyans are being killed because of this bombardment . \nMassacres are being mercilessly committed against the Libyan people , '' he said in a letter to world leaders . \n`` We are a people united behind the leadership of the revolution , facing the terrorism of al Qaeda on the one hand and on the other hand terrorism by NATO , which now directly supports al Qaeda , '' Libya 's official news agency quoted him as saying . \nThe rebels deny any al Qaeda links and on Tuesday promised free and fair elections if Gaddafi is forced from power . \nAdmiral James Stavridis , head of U.S. European Command , told the U.S. Senate that intelligence on the rebel forces had shown ` flickers ' of al Qaeda or Hezbollah presence , but no `` detail sufficient to say there is a significant al Qaeda presence . '' \nClinton met the opposition Libyan National Council envoy Mahmoud Jebril before the London talks . \nAfter the conference , she said a political resolution could include Gaddafi leaving the country , and noted that a U.N. special envoy would visit Tripoli soon to explore that option and urge Gaddafi to implement a real ceasefire . \n`` As you know there is a lot of reaching out that is occurring , a lot of conversations that are going on , '' she said . \n`` He will have to make a decision and that decision , so far as we 're aware , has not yet been made . '' \nObama once again ruled out sending ground troops to Libya or directly toppling Gaddafi militarily . \n`` To be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq , '' Obama said in a televised address before the conference . \nHowever , the United States and France both said they could consider arming the rebels . \n`` I 'm not ruling it in , I 'm not ruling it out , '' Obama told NBC . \nWashington argues that this possibility is covered by the U.N. resolution , but even its allies disagree . \n`` I remind you it is not part of the U.N. resolution , which France sticks to , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters , `` but we are ready to discuss it with our partners .

'' \nIn the nine days since the start of the Western-led bombing , the motley volunteer force of rebels has pressed half-way along the coast from its stronghold of Benghazi towards the capital Tripoli and regained control of most major oil terminals in the OPEC member state . \nA U.S. Treasury Department official said the rebels could sell Libyan crude without being subject to U.S. sanctions if they conducted the transactions outside the National Oil Corporation and other entities in Gaddafi 's administration subject to sanctions . \nWith its finances under pressure , the rebel leadership said it hopes to restart oil exports within a week . \nSome energy traders said that , sanctions aside , they could not touch Libyan oil because of shipping and legal risks . \nOn Monday the rebels met sporadic resistance as they continued their advance in convoys of pick-up trucks with machineguns mounted on them . \nJust west of sandy , barren Nawfaliyah , bursts of sustained machinegun fire and the whoosh of several rockets could be heard , and plumes of black smoke rose ahead . \n`` Those are from our guns , '' said Faisal Bozgaia , 28 , a hospital worker turned rebel fighter , pointing to the smoke . \nRebels said occasional ambushes by Gaddafi forces had pushed them back but that they later regained their positions . \n`` We are advancing one , two kilometres at a time , '' rebel Khalif Ali , 22 , said in the town of Harawah , west of Nawfaliyah . \nBut the rapid advance is stretching rebel supply lines . \n`` We have a serious problem with petrol , '' said a volunteer fighter waiting to fill up in the oil town of Ras Lanuf . \nReuters correspondent Michael Georgy , reporting from Sirte to the west , said he saw police and military but no sign of fighting . \nSoldiers were manning checkpoints and green Libyan flags flapped in the wind . \nMilitiamen fired AK-47 rifles defiantly into the air . \n`` If they come to Sirte , we will defend our city , '' said Osama bin Nafaa , 32 , a policeman . \nIn Misrata , Gaddafi soldiers manned checkpoints and took up position on rooftops . \nSome housefronts were smashed , smoke was rising from several areas and gunfire rang out constantly across the city . \nSeveral civilians approached a group of journalists , some of them woman and children waving green flags . \n`` Civilians are happy , '' said an army official who declined to be named . \n`` Everything you are hearing is a lie . \nThe function of our army is to save the people and to protect the leader . \nWe can not kill our own people .

'' \nAid agencies , based in the rebel-held east , were able to bring in supplies via Misrata 's Mediterranean port last week but it is uncertain if they can deliver more because control over the port has seesawed between rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces . \n`` We are very concerned -LRB- about Misrata -RRB- , '' said Eman Moankar , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross operations in eastern Libya . \n`` The consequences of this fighting is a worry for us .

'' \nThe World Health Organization , present at the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , has propositioned drugs and medical equipment there . \n`` As soon as we have access to Libya , as other U.N. agencies , we will help in providing these drugs to centers and hospitals , '' spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said . \nIn the capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's main power base , residents are also facing tough conditions . \nPrices have soared , basic items such as milk and cooking gas have grown scarce , and people must spend hours queuing as the war hits daily life . \n`` Tripoli is suffering , '' a resident , who did not want to be identified , said by phone . \n`` This is the life in Tripoli . \nIt 's getting worse every day . '' \nShop shelves have fast emptied and gas canisters as well as electric hot plates to warm coffee and tea without using gas have become scarce . \n`` Most of the products have now disappeared , children 's milk , for example , '' he said . \nAs residents have rushed to stock up for what international observers say could be weeks or months of war , some have hoarded supplies , resulting in steep price hikes . \n`` Most of the commodities like oil , the basic needs , prices are increasing , '' the resident said . \n`` For example , we used to buy one can of oil for cars , it used to cost 1.25 dinars , now it costs almost five dinars . \nWhen you come to cooking oil , it 's also double the price . '' \n`` If you want to buy it you have to go early , maybe you will find it , maybe you wo n't . \nPeople are very frightened so they store these things in their house , and some they store and sell for double the prices . '' \nAs is typical in an economy of shortage , especially in a country under international embargo , Libyans must spend hours in line to obtain basic goods . \nAdding to the difficulties are shorter store hours than usual . \n`` There are very big queues in the banks and sometimes they do n't have currency . \nSo they have queues in the banks , queues in the gas stations , queues in the shops , '' the resident said . \nLibyan national television has said little about the hardships of current daily life , showing mainly pro-Gaddafi rallies and events for many hours of its broadcast day . \nShokri Ghanem , the chairman of Libya 's National Oil Corporation , said on Tuesday oil output had `` dramatically declined '' and that there was a petrol shortage . \n`` There is a crisis because of what is happening in Libya . \nI hope there will be a solution soon , '' he said on state TV . \n`` Many oil fields have halted because the foreign work force left the country . \nMany refineries have also stopped producing including Brega . \nIt 's difficult to return to normal in a short period . \nThat needs time .

{"id": "150", "time": "2011-07-26", "text": "TRIPOLI | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 2:51 pm BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Efforts to find a deal to end the civil war in Libya intensified on Tuesday , with a U.N. special envoy heading for Tripoli and Western powers signalling that Muammar Gaddafi could stay in the country if he gives up power . \nU.N. envoy Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who visited the rebels in Benghazi on Monday , is looking for a `` political process '' that will end a war that has failed to dislodge Gaddafi despite months of rebel attacks backed by NATO bombing raids . \nFrance and other Western members of the anti-Gaddafi coalition have signalled that the Libyan leader could stay in the country provided he and his circle agree to step down . \nA rebel leader this week appeared to endorse this view , which would mark a major shift in policy as previous demands have insisted that Gaddafi must leave the country . \nDeadlines are approaching for the NATO-led alliance , whose mandate for military action expires on September 27 . \nHopes have also been expressed that some agreement could be reached before the holy month of Ramadan begins at the start of August . \nBritain and France , two of the main backers of the campaign to end Gaddafi 's four decades in charge of the North African oil-producing nation , held talks in London at which they called once more for Gaddafi to leave power . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague and his French counterpart Alain Juppe also said that it was up to the Libyan people to decide their own future . \nBritish officials said there had been no change of policy direction , but the comments were interpreted as tacit backing for the proposal that Gaddafi can remain in Libya after quitting . \n`` Gaddafi must leave power , '' Hague told reporters on Monday evening . \n`` The best way of showing the Libyan people they need no longer be in fear of Gaddafi would be for him to leave Libya . \n`` So that very much remains our position , but it 's also very clear that whatever is settled is a settlement which the Libyan people are happy with . \nIt 's for them to determine their future , not for those outside to try to lay down that future . '' \nJuppe , who has already endorsed the idea of Gaddafi remaining in Libya after leaving power , added : `` As far as we are concerned , Gaddafi should renounce any kind of power in Libya and he must commit himself to not play any kind of role . '' \n`` Gaddafi is going to have to abandon power and then it will be for the Libyan people to decide what their future will be , '' Juppe said . \nGaddafi has supported talks with the rebels and with the West . \nBut while he has made clear he backs the idea of his remaining in Libya , he has shown no sign in public of agreeing to the other part of the deal -- stepping down from power . \nWhile rebel forces have been unable to move decisively against Gaddafi , they have accused neighbouring Algeria of bolstering his troops by turning a blind eye to an arms shipment . \nAlgeria denied it had allowed the weapons to be offloaded at an Algerian port . \nIn his talks with the Benghazi-based rebel leadership council , Khatib , the U.N. envoy , discussed ideas for ending the war but said a firm initiative had yet to take shape . \nWith a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Khatib told Reuters he would canvass government views in Tripoli on Tuesday . \n`` We did not put a plan in front of them . \nWe discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . \nLibyan officials said they expected the Tripoli talks , with senior Gaddafi aides , would cover peace negotiations . \nBut they also wanted to focus on civilian casualties and a desire to urge NATO to stop its air strikes . \nNATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during Ramadan . \nBut hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . \nSpeaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibril said he had underlined that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . \nKhatib , a senior Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a cease-fire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . \nHe has not given details . \n`` So far , there is no initiative . \nHe is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . \nThe rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . \nIn the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . \n`` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . \n`` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . \nThe same conditions will apply to his family . '' \nThe poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . \nRebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . \nWhile rebels in the east received a boost this week when Turkey delivered its first cargo of fuel under a multi-million dollar supply deal , a government rocket attack has cut fuel supplies in the frontline western town of Misrata . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe has fought the rebels and NATO to a standstill . \nHe has effectively won . \nNATO will , in a few months , make some kind of excuse for leaving Libya , and then Gaddafi 's army will move in decisively on the rebels and finish them off . \nThousands will be executed and Gaddafi will go down in history as the man who beat us all . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "254", "time": "2011-04-01", "text": "Vehicles belonging to forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi explode after an air strike by coalition forces , along a road between Benghazi and Ajdabiyah March 20 , 2011 . \nIt is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . \nPARIS | Fri Apr 1 , 2011 9:14 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . \nOnly Nicolas Sarkozy saw the popular revolt that began in Libya on February 15 as an opportunity for political and diplomatic redemption . \nWhether the French president 's energetic leadership of an international coalition to protect the Libyan people from Muammar Gaddafi will be enough to revive his sagging domestic fortunes in next year 's election is highly uncertain . \nBut by pushing for military strikes that he hopes might repair France 's reputation in the Arab world , Sarkozy helped shape what type of war it would be . \nThe road to Western military intervention was paved with mutual suspicion , fears of another quagmire in a Muslim country and doubts about the largely unknown ragtag Libyan opposition with which the West has thrown in its lot . \nThat will make it harder to hold together an uneasy coalition of Americans , Europeans and Arabs , the longer Gaddafi holds out . \nAlmost two weeks into the air campaign , Western policymakers fret about the risk of a stray bomb hitting a hospital or an orphanage , or of the conflict sliding into a prolonged stalemate . \nThere is no doubt the outcome in Tripoli will have a bearing on the fate of the popular movement for change across the Arab world . \nBut because this war was born in Paris it will also have consequences for Europe . \n`` It 's high time that Europeans stopped exporting their own responsibilities to Washington , '' says Nick Witney , a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . \n`` If the West fails in Libya , it will be primarily a European failure . '' \nWhen the first Arab pro-democracy uprisings shook the thrones of aging autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt in January , France had got itself on the wrong side of history . \nForeign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie had enjoyed a winter holiday in Tunisia , a former French colony , oblivious to the rising revolt . \nShe and her family had taken free flights on the private jet of a businessman close to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , and then publicly offered the government French assistance with riot control just a few days before Ben Ali was ousted by popular protests . \nWorse was to come . \nIt turned out that French Prime Minister Francois Fillon had spent his Christmas vacation up the Nile as the guest of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the next autocrat in the Arab democracy movement 's firing line , while Sarkozy and his wife Carla had soaked up the winter sunshine in Morocco , another former French territory ruled by a barely more liberal divine-right monarch . \nTelevision stations were re-running embarrassing footage of the president giving Gaddafi a red-carpet welcome in Paris in 2007 , when Libya 's `` brother leader '' planted his tent in the grounds of the Hotel de Marigny state guest house across the road from the Elysee presidential palace . \nOn February 27 , a few days after Libyan rebels hoisted the pre-Gaddafi tricolor flag defiantly in Benghazi , Sarkozy fired his foreign minister . \nIn a speech announcing the appointment of Alain Juppe as her successor , Sarkozy cited the need to adapt France 's foreign and security policy to the new situation created by the Arab uprisings . \n`` This is an historic change , '' he said . \n`` We must not be afraid of it . \nWe must have one sole aim : to accompany , support and help the people who have chosen freedom . '' \nMAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT Yet the international air campaign against Gaddafi 's forces might never have happened without the self-appointed activism of French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy , a left-leaning philosopher and talk-show groupie , who lobbied Sarkozy to take up the cause of Libya 's pro-democracy rebels . \nLibya was the latest of a string of international causes that the libertarian icon with his unbuttoned white designer shirts and flowing mane of greying hair has championed over the last two decades after Bosnian Muslims , Algerian secularists , Afghan rebels and Georgia 's side in the conflict with Russia . \nLevy went to meet the Libyan rebels and telephoned Sarkozy from Benghazi in early March . \n`` I 'd like to bring you the Libyan Massouds , '' Levy says he told the president , comparing the anti-Gaddafi opposition with former Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud , who fought against the Islamist Taliban before being assassinated . \n`` As Gaddafi only clings on through violence , I think he 'll collapse , '' the philosopher told Reuters in an interview . \nOn March 10 , Levy accompanied two envoys of the Libyan Transitional Council to Sarkozy 's office . \nTo their surprise and to the consternation of France 's allies , the president recognized the council as the `` legitimate representative of the Libyan people '' and told them he favored not only establishing a no-fly zone to protect them but also carrying out `` limited targeted strikes '' against Gaddafi 's forces . \nIn doing so without consultation on the eve of a European Union summit called to discuss Libya , Sarkozy upstaged Washington , which was still debating what to do , embarrassed London , which wanted broad support for a no-fly zone , and infuriated Berlin , France 's closest European partner . \nHe also stunned his own foreign minister , who learned about the decision to recognize the opposition from a news agency dispatch , aides said , while in Brussels trying to coax the EU into backing a no-fly zone . \n`` Quite a lot of members of the European Council were irritated to discover that France had recognized the Libyan opposition council and the Elysee was talking of targeted strikes , '' a senior European diplomat said . \nAcross the Channel , British Prime Minister David Cameron , aware of the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war , had turned his back on Tony Blair 's doctrine of liberal interventionism when he took office in 2010 . \nBut after facing criticism over the slow evacuation of British nationals from Libya and a trade-promotion trip to the Gulf in the midst of the Arab uprisings , he overruled cabinet skeptics , military doubters and critics among his own Conservative lawmakers to join Sarkozy in campaigning for military action . \nHowever , Cameron sought to reassure parliament that he was not entering an Iraq-style open-ended military commitment . \n`` This is different to Iraq . \nThis is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' he said . \nIn Britain , as in France , the government won bipartisan support for intervention . \nIn Germany , on the other hand , the Libyan uprising was an unwelcome distraction from domestic politics . \nIt played directly into the campaign for regional elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg , a south-western state which Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats had governed since 1953 . \nForeign Minister Guido Westerwelle , leader of the Free Democrats , the liberal junior partners in Merkel 's coalition , tried to surf on pacifist public opinion by opposing military action . \nPolls showed two-thirds of voters opposed German involvement in Libya , a country where Nazi Germany 's Afrika Korps had suffered desert defeats in World War Two . \nPresent-day Germany 's armed forces were already overstretched in Afghanistan , where some 5,000 soldiers are engaged in an unpopular long-term mission . \nWesterwelle made it impossible for Merkel to support a no-fly zone , even without participating . \nHe publicly criticized the Franco-British proposal for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent Gaddafi using his air force against Libyan civilians . \nMerkel said she was skeptical . \nThe Germans prevented a March 11 EU summit from making any call for a no-fly zone , much to the frustration of the French and British . \nRelations between France 's Juppe and Westerwelle deteriorated further the following week when Germany prevented foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized powers from calling for a no-fly zone in Libya . \nWesterwelle told reporters : `` Military intervention is not the solution . \nFrom our point of view , it is very difficult and dangerous . \nWe do not want to get sucked into a war in North Africa . \nWe would not like to step on a slippery slope where we all are at the end in a war . '' \nThat argument angered allies . \nAs the meeting broke up , a senior European diplomat tells Reuters , Juppe turned to Westerwelle and said : `` Now that you have achieved everything you wanted , Gaddafi can go ahead and massacre his people . '' \nWhen the issue came to the U.N. Security Council on March 17 , 10 days before the Baden-Wuerttemberg election , Germany abstained , along with Russia , China , India and Brazil , and said it would take no part in military operations . \nIronically , that stance seems to have been politically counterproductive . \nThe center-right coalition lost the regional election anyway , and both leaders were severely criticized by German media for having isolated Germany from its western partners , including the United States . \nThe main political beneficiaries were the ecologist Greens , seen as both anti-nuclear and anti-war . \nIn Washington , meanwhile , President Barack Obama was , as usual , taking his time to make up his mind . \nMilitary action in Libya was the last thing the U.S. president needed , just when he was trying to extricate American troops from two unpopular wars in Muslim countries launched by his predecessor , George W. Bush . \nObama had sought to rebuild damaged relations with the Muslim world , seen as a key driver of radicalization and terrorism against the United States . \nThe president trod a fine line in embracing pro-democracy and reform movements in the Arab world and Iran while trying to avoid undermining vital U.S. interests in the absolute monarchies of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and other Gulf states . \nCompared to those challenges , Libya was a sideshow . \nThe United States had no big economic or political interests in the North African oil and gas producing state and instinctively saw it as part of Europe 's backyard . \nObama had also sought to encourage allies , notably in Europe , to take more responsibility for their own security issues . \nSpelling out the administration 's deep reluctance to get dragged into another potential Arab quagmire , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a farewell speech to officer cadets at the West Point military academy on March 4 : `` In my opinion , any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should ` have his head examined ' , as General -LRB- Douglas -RRB- MacArthur so delicately put it . '' \nProminent U.S. foreign policy lawmakers , including Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator John McCain pressed the Obama administration in early March to impose a `` no - fly '' zone over Libya and explore other military options , such as bombing runways . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton had said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on February 28 that a `` no-fly '' zone was `` an option which we are actively considering '' . \nBut the White House pushed back against pressure from lawmakers . \n`` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said on March 7 . \n`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' \nWhile Carney said a no-fly zone was a serious option , other U.S. civilian and military officials cautioned that it would be difficult to enforce . \nOn March 10 , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper forecast in Congress that Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces would prevail in the long term , saying Gaddafi appeared to be `` hunkering down for the duration '' . \nIf there was to be intervention , it had become clear , it would have to come quickly . \nU.S. officials say the key event that helped Clinton and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , persuade Obama of the need for intervention was a March 12 decision by the Arab League to ask the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone to protect the Libyan population . \nThe Arab League 's unprecedented resolve -- the organization has long been plagued by chronic divisions and a lack of spine -- reflected the degree to which Gaddafi had alienated his peers , especially Saudi Arabia . \nWhen the quixotic colonel bothered to attend Arab summits , it was usually to insult the Saudi king and other veteran rulers . \nThe Arab League decision gave a regional seal of approval that Western nations regarded as vital for military action . \nMoreover , two Arab states - Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - soon said they would participate in enforcing a no-fly zone , and a third , Lebanon , co-sponsored a United Nations resolution to authorize the use of force . \nArab diplomats said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister with presidential ambitions , played the key role in squeezing an agreement out of the closed-door meeting . \nSyria , Sudan , Algeria and Yemen were all against any move to invite foreign intervention in an Arab state . \nBut diplomats said that by couching the resolution as an appeal to the U.N. Security Council , Moussa maneuvered his way around Article VI of the Arab League 's statutes requiring that such decisions be taken unanimously . \nIt was he who announced the outcome , saying Gaddafi 's government had lost legitimacy because of its `` crimes against the Libyan people '' . \nThe African Union , in which Gaddafi played an active but idiosyncratic role , condemned the Libyan leader 's crackdown but rejected foreign military intervention and created a panel of leaders to try to resolve the conflict through dialogue . \nHowever , all three African states on the Security Council - South Africa , Nigeria and Gabon - voted for the resolution . \nFrance acted as if it had AU support anyway . \nSarkozy invited the organization 's secretary-general , Jean Ping , to the Elysee palace for a showcase summit of coalition countries on the day military action began , and he attended , providing African political cover for the operation . \nHaving failed to win either EU or G8 backing for a no-fly zone , and with the United States internally divided and holding back , France and Britain were in trouble in their quest for a U.N. resolution despite the Arab League support . \nGaddafi 's forces had regrouped and recaptured a swathe of the western and central coastal plain , including some key oil terminals , and were advancing fast on Benghazi , a city of 700,000 and the rebels ' stronghold . \nIf international intervention did not come within days , it would be too late . \nGaddafi 's troops would be in the population centers , making surgical air strikes impossible without inflicting civilian casualties . \nIn the nick of time , Obama came off the fence on March 15 at a two-part meeting of his National Security Council . \nHillary Clinton participated by telephone from Paris , Susan Rice by secure video link from New York . \nBoth were deeply aware of the events of the 1990s , when Bill Clinton 's administration , in which Rice was an adviser on Africa , had failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda , and only intervened in Bosnia after the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two . \nThey reviewed what was at stake now . \nThere were credible reports that Gaddafi forces were preparing to massacre the rebels . \nWhat signal would it send to Arab democrats if the West let him get away with that , and if Mubarak and Ben Ali , whose armies refused to turn their guns on the people , were overthrown while Gaddafi , who had used his airforce , tanks and artillery against civilian protesters , survived in office ? \nThe president overruled doubters among his military and national security advisers and decided the United States would support an ambitious U.N. resolution going beyond just a no-fly zone , on the strict condition that Washington would quickly hand over leadership of the military action to its allies . \n`` Within days , not weeks , '' one participant quoted him as saying . \nA senior administration official , speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity , said the key concern was to avoid any impression that the United States was once again unilaterally bombing an Arab country . \nAsked what had swung Washington toward agreeing to join military action in Libya , he said : `` It 's more that events were evolving and so positions had to address the change of events . '' \n`` The key elements were the Arab League statement , the Lebanese support , co-sponsorship of the actual resolution as the Arab representative on the Security Council , a series of conversations with Arab leaders over the course of that week , leading up to the resolution . \nAll of that convinced us that the Arab countries were fully supportive of the broad resolution that would provide the authorization necessary to protect civilians and to provide humanitarian relief , and then the -LRB- March 19 -RRB- gathering in Paris , confirmed that there was support for the means necessary to carry out the resolution , namely the use of military force , '' the official said . \nWhen Rice told her French and British counterparts at the United Nations that Washington now favored a far more aggressive Security Council resolution , including air and sea strikes , they first feared a trap . \nWas Obama deliberately trying to provoke a Russian veto , a French official mused privately . \n`` I had a phone call from Susan Rice , Tuesday 8 p.m. , and a phone call from Susan Rice at 11 p.m. , and everything had changed in three hours , '' a senior Western envoy told Reuters . \n`` On Wednesday morning , at the -LRB- Security -RRB- Council , in a sort of totally awed silence , Susan Rice said : ` We want to be allowed to strike Libyan forces on the ground . ' \nThere was a sort of a bit surprised silence . '' \nRight up to the day of the vote , when Juppe took a plane to New York to swing vital votes behind the resolution , Moscow 's attitude was uncertain . \nSo too were the three African votes . \nBritish and French diplomats tried desperately to contact the Nigerian , South African and Gabonese ambassadors but kept being told they were in a meeting . \n`` There was drama right up to the last minute , '' another U.N. diplomat said . \nThat day , March 17 , Clinton had just come out of a television studio in Tunis , epicenter of the first Arab democratic revolution , when she spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on a secure cellphone . \nLavrov , who had strongly opposed a no-fly zone when they met in Geneva on February 28 and remained skeptical when they talked again in Paris on March 14 , told her Moscow would not block the resolution . \nThe senior U.S. official denied that Washington had offered Russia trade and diplomatic benefits in return for acquiescence , as suggested by a senior non-American diplomat . \nHowever , Obama telephoned President Dimitry Medvedev the following week and reaffirmed his support for Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organization , which U.S. ally Georgia is blocking . \nChina too abstained , allowing the resolution to pass with 10 votes in favor , five abstentions and none against . \nIt authorized the use of `` all necessary measures '' - code for military action -- to protect the civilian population but expressly ruled out a foreign occupation force in any part of Libya . \nThe United States construes it to allow arms sales to the rebels . \nMost others do not . \nReuters reported exclusively on March 29 that Obama had signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces . \nThe White House and the Central Intelligence Agency declined comment . \nClinton said no decision had been taken on whether to arm the rebels . \nNo sooner had the first cruise missiles been fired than the Arab League 's Moussa complained that the Western powers had gone beyond the U.N. resolution and caused civilian casualties . \nHis outburst appeared mainly aimed at assuaging Arab public opinion , particularly in Egypt , and he muted his criticism after telephone calls from Paris , London and Washington . \nTurkey , the leading Muslim power in NATO with big economic interests in Libya , bitterly criticized the military action in an Islamic country . \nThe Turks were exasperated to see France , the most vociferous adversary of its EU membership bid , leading the coalition . \nSarkozy , who alternated on a brief maiden visit to Ankara on February 25 between trying to sell Turkish leaders French nuclear power plants and telling them bluntly to drop their EU ambitions , further angered Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan by failing to invite Turkey to the Paris conference on Libya . \nItaly , the former colonial power which had Europe 's biggest trade and investment ties with Libya , had publicly opposed military action until the last minute , but opened its air bases to coalition forces as soon as the U.N. resolution passed . \nHowever , Rome quickly demanded that NATO , in which it had a seat at the decision-making table , should take over command of the whole operation . \nForeign Minister Franco Frattini threatened to take back control of the vital Italian bases unless the mission was placed under NATO . \nBut Turkey and France were fighting diplomatic dogfights at NATO headquarters . \nAnkara wanted to use its NATO veto put the handcuffs on the coalition to stop offensive operations . \nFrance wanted to keep political leadership away from the U.S.-led military alliance to avoid a hostile reaction in the Arab world . \nThe United States signaled its determination to hand over operational command within days , not weeks , as Obama had promised , and wanted tried-and-trusted NATO at the wheel . \nIt took a week of wrangling before agreement was reached for NATO to take charge of the entire military campaign . \nIn return , France won agreement to create a `` contact group '' including Arab and African partners , to coordinate political efforts on Libya 's future . \nTurkey was assuaged by being invited to a London international conference that launched that process . \nThat enabled the United States to lower its profile and Obama to declare that Washington would not act alone as the world 's policeman `` wherever repression occurs '' . \nWhile the president promised to scale back U.S. involvement to a `` supporting role '' , the military statistics tell a different tale . \nAs of March 29 , the United States had fired all but 7 of the 214 cruise missiles used in the conflict and flown 1,103 sorties compared to 669 for all other allies combined . \nIt also dropped 455 of the first 600 bombs , according to the Pentagon . \nFor all the showcasing of Arab involvement , only six military aircraft from Qatar had arrived in theater by March 30 . \nThey joined French air patrols but did not fly combat missions , a military source said . \nSarkozy announced that the United Arab Emirates would send 12 F16 fighters , but NATO and UAE officials refused to say when they would arrive . \nBritain 's Cameron spoke of unspecified logistical contributions from Kuwait and Jordan . \nThe main Arab contribution is clearly political cover rather than military assets . \nWhile the duration and the outcome of the war remain uncertain , some political casualties are already visible . \nUnless the conflict ends in disaster , Germany and its chancellor and foreign minister - particularly the latter - are set to emerge as losers . \n`` I can tell you there are people in London and Paris who are asking themselves whether this Germany is the kind of country we would like to have as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council . \nThat 's a legitimate question which was n't posed before , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters . \nGerman officials brush aside such talk , saying Berlin would have the backing of its western partners and needs support from developing and emerging countries more in tune with its abstention on the Libya resolution . \nMerkel has moved quickly to try to limit the damage . \nShe attended the Paris conference and went along with an EU summit statement on March 25 welcoming the U.N. resolution on which her own government had abstained a week earlier . \nShe also offered NATO extra help in aerial surveillance in Afghanistan to free up Western resources for the Libya campaign . \nA second conspicuous casualty has been the European Union 's attempt to build a common foreign , security and Defense policy , and the official meant to personify that ambition , High Representative Catherine Ashton . \nMany in Paris , London , Brussels and Washington have drawn the conclusion that European Defense is an illusion , given Germany 's visceral reticence about military action . \nFuture serious operations are more likely to be left to NATO , or to coalitions of the willing around Britain and France . \nBy general agreement , Ashton has so far had a bad war . \nDespite having been among the first European officials to embrace the Arab uprisings and urge the EU to engage with democracy movements in North Africa , she angered both the British and French by airing her doubts about a no-fly zone and the Germans by subsequently welcoming the U.N. resolution . \nUnable to please everyone , she managed to please no one . \nAs for Sarkozy , whether he emerges as a hero or a reckless adventurer may depend on events beyond his control in the sands of Libya . \nJustin Vaisse , a Frenchman who heads the Center for the Study of the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington , detected an undertone of `` Francophobia and Sarkophobia '' among U.S. policy elites as the war began . \n`` Either the war will go well , and he will look like a far-sighted , decisive leader , or it will go badly and reinforce the image of a showboating cowboy driving the world into war , '' Vaisse said . \nThe jury is still out . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIncome should be much more to the content producer and web publisher . \nOnce upon a time , a market seller in Tunisia set fire to ... the Arab order , NATO , European unity , US politics , ... Big fuel buildup problem if you are a firefighter . \nI now pity the rebels in Libya . \nThey are needing to rely now on the same Europe that could n't even defend its own territory in two World Wars without a massive American commitment , and which needded U. S. military punch even to settle the conflict the Balkansafter European soldiers stood by during masacres . \nPerhaps the rebels should have learned a lesson from Croatia after it got its no fly zone and built an Army before trying to take back the rest of their nation . \nI hope the rebels win and do in fact create a democracy in Libya , but the way the Syrian dictator is acting , he no longer fears a successful revolt in his nation . \nGaddafi is showing that guns for hire do work . \nI just wonder why the rebels have n't also hired mercenaries to form a leadership cohort in conjunction with the soldiers who switched to the rebellion . \nPerhaps though NATO is waiting for Gaddafi to put his tanks and artellery on exposed terrain during their long march to Bengazi . \nWe can only hope . \nThere were some news items reporting that a few big tribes are spproting Mr. G.

'' \nIt was not possible to call Misrata later in the day . \nOn Wednesday evening , the online news website Brnieq quoted a telecommunications official in Tripoli as saying Libyan authorities had ordered all mobile and land services cut . \nEarlier , residents and rebel fighters who spoke to Reuters said Gaddafi loyalists had begun to bombard the city at 7:00 a.m -LRB- 0500 GMT -RRB- with tanks , artillery and rockets , in what appeared to be preparation for an assault . \nBut they said that ground forces had yet to enter Misrata and were still in the outskirts . \nAccounts of fighting in Misrata could not be verified because Libyan authorities have barred reporters from the city . \nLibyan officials had no immediate comment on reports of an attack . \nA doctor at Misrata hospital said 11 people had been killed and 20 wounded in the fighting . \nHe said the wounded were being brought to hospital in private cars because ambulance drivers were afraid of being hit by shells . \n`` We have enough medicine but we are short on staff , '' said the doctor , who gave his name as Muftah . \nA rebel fighter in Misrata , who did not give his name , said the city would make a stand . \n`` They are trying to enter the city . \nI do not think they will be able to do it , at least not today , '' he said . \nThe assault on Misrata , Libya 's third-biggest city with a population of about 300,000 , coincides with a rapid advance by Gaddafi 's forces on rebel strongholds in eastern Libya . \nGaddafi , in power since a military coup in 1969 , lost control of large swathes of Libya in a revolt last month , but since then his security forces have fought back . \nState television made an appeal to the people of Misrata to support the security forces and turn their back on the rebels . \n`` The armed forces are from you and for you , '' the appeal said . \n`` Avoid strife ... This is a call for stability and security for everybody . \nDo not listen to provocation and avoid discord . '' \n"}

Libya action 1 of 2 . \nUnited Nations Security Council diplomats vote on a resolution during a meeting on Libya at U.N. headquarters in New York February 26 , 2011 . \nUNITED NATIONS | Wed Mar 16 , 2011 7:06 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United States , France and Britain on Wednesday urged the U.N. Security Council to take swift action on a proposed no-fly zone over Libya , as Washington suggested it might have decided to back the plan . \nThe Security Council met through the day behind closed doors to discuss a draft resolution authorizing a no-fly zone to halt Libyan government air strikes on rebels . \nBut some council members , including veto powers Russia and China , are either undecided or have doubts . \nBritish , French and Lebanese envoys distributed the draft on Tuesday after the Arab League called on the council to approve a no-fly zone in Libya . \nLibya 's deputy U.N. envoy Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of leader Muammar Gaddafi last month inspired dozens of similar defections by Tripoli 's diplomats worldwide , said there was no time for delays as Gaddafi 's forces continue to pummel rebel forces in the east . \n`` The international community has to act within the next 10 hours , '' said Dabbashi . \nIn remarks that suggested a reluctant Washington had now agreed to support the idea of a no-fly zone , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was hopeful the council would take a vote on a Libya resolution no later than Thursday . \n`` We are moving as rapidly as we can in New York to see whether we can get additional authorization for the international community to look at a broad range of actions , not just a no-fly zone but other actions as well , '' Clinton told reporters in Cairo . \n`` We wo n't know until there is an actual vote . \nWe 're hoping that will be no later than tomorrow , '' she said . \nClinton told CBS television that the Arab League call for a no-fly zone had caused a `` sea change '' in thinking . \n`` For the Arab League to call for military action to protect civilians in Libya , against a member of the Arab League , was an extraordinary statement of leadership and real conviction , '' she said . \n`` That has changed the thinking of a lot of people . '' \nWashington had reacted cautiously to the calls for a no-fly zone over Libya , with some officials concerned it could be militarily ineffective or politically damaging . \nIt has insisted Arab nations actively participate in any such zone over Libya . \nFrench U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters he had formally submitted the draft to the U.N. secretariat with a view to putting it to a vote on Thursday . \nHe said council members could propose final amendments overnight . \nDiplomats said Araud was trying to force a vote . \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in a letter to the council that it was `` high time for the international community ... to pull together ... and respond without delay to the urgent appeal of the League of Arab States . '' \n`` Together , we can save the martyred people of Libya , '' he said . \n`` It is now a matter of days , if not hours . \nThe worst would be that the appeal of the -LRB- Arab League -RRB- and the Security Council decisions be overruled by the force of arms . '' \nLebanese Ambassador Nawaf Salam urged the council to act before it was too late for a no-fly zone to have any impact . \nHe cited a prediction by Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam that the rebels would be defeated within two days . \n`` It is our hope that the Security Council will impose a no-fly zone quickly and prove him wrong , '' he said . \nSalam said one concern raised by Germany and others -- the apparent clash between the Arab League 's call for a no-fly zone and its opposition to foreign military intervention -- was not a contradiction . \nHe said Arab nations would help enforce any no-fly zone authorized by the council . \n`` There will be a significant Arab participation , '' he said . \nClinton told CBS the Arabs should play a prominent role . \n`` The Arab League statement , their very courageous stance , suggests that they know that they have to step up and lead and participate in any action that would be internationally authorized , '' she said . \nThe draft resolution , obtained by Reuters , says the council `` decides to establish a ban on all flights in the airspace of -LRB- Libya -RRB- in order to help protect civilians . '' \nIt authorizes member states to `` take all necessary measures to enforce compliance '' and says countries implementing the ban would be doing so in cooperation with the Arab League and in coordination with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . \nThe draft also provides for expanding sanctions already slapped by the U.N. council on Libyan leaders on February 26 -- including asset freezes , travel bans and an arms embargo -- to cover all assets abroad of the Gaddafi government . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe creators of both knew this truth yet dishonored the memory of the many millions of lost souls who staked their lives that it would never happen again not once but twice . \nOh God , let not this war be fought in vain , Show us where we failed and help us to bring Peace on earth and goodwill among men . \n-LRB- The late Captain G.V.

'' \nGamaty reaffirmed the council 's commitment to a `` clear road map '' to democracy , including a constitution to be drafted within eight months , a referendum and then full elections in 2013 . \n`` By the end of about 20 months the Libyan people will have elected the leaders they want to lead their country , '' he said . \nAs the rebels hunt Gaddafi , a spokesman for his son Saif al-Islam said he has been traveling around close to Tripoli , meeting tribal leaders and preparing to retake the capital . \nIn a telephone call to Reuters in Tunisia from what he said was a `` southern suburb of Tripoli , '' Moussa Ibrahim derided the ability of the NTC to run the country and said their Western backers should negotiate with the ousted leader . \nThere was no way to verify his comments which , like those broadcast this week by Gaddafi himself , serve as a public reminder to Libyans he remains at large and may pose a threat , at least by means of a guerrilla war , to the new authorities . \nEchoing comments made by Gaddafi and his son in recent broadcasts from hiding , Ibrahim said : `` Our army still controls many regions of Libya . \nWe will be able to capture Tripoli back and many other cities in the near future . \nThe fight is very , very far from over . \nWithin even a few weeks , a few months , even a couple of years , we will have Libya back . '' \nIn Tripoli , life was returning to normal . \nMunicipal street sweepers picked up litter and spent bullet casings on Martyrs Square , known under Gaddafi as Green Square . \nNTC fighters had removed some roadblocks on a main road along the shoreline and more foodstores were open , although water supplies and power remained erratic . \nSeveral thousands of people , mainly women , later gathered in the square singing a new national anthem and carrying banners , which read `` For the first time we are free . '' \nNTC education chief Soliman el-Sahli told Reuters that schools would reopen on September 17 , despite some bombed-out classrooms , scarce transport and a curriculum until this year based on Gaddafi 's personal `` Green Book '' -- an eclectic account of the `` Brother Leader 's '' views of the world . \nOne unknown in the process of installing an elected president and parliament is when the timetable will start running . \nThe council road map says the process would begin once the NTC declares Libya `` liberated '' from Gaddafi . \nIts leaders have said the war will not end until he is found `` dead or alive '' so it is unclear when liberation might be achieved . \nOn Thursday , the 42nd anniversary of the military coup which brought him to power as a 27-year-old army captain , Gaddafi , who is now 69 , declared his defiance in messages on satellite television . \nNTC commanders say they think he is hiding in the tribal bastion of Bani Walid , some 100 miles southeast of Tripoli . \nThere are also suggestions he may be in his hometown of Sirte on the coast , or indeed elsewhere . \n`` Let it be a long battle . \nWe will fight from place to place , from town to town , from valley to valley , from mountain to mountain , '' Gaddafi said in one message . \nIn later comments he threatened urban warfare . \nNTC commanders say they are taking their time trying to cajole pro-Gaddafi holdouts like Bani Walid and Sirte into surrender in the interest of sparing further bloodshed . \nA Libyan from Bani Walid said he had been in sporadic contact this week with people in the city . \n`` I know that two months ago most of the family , the younger children , were staying in Bani Walid , '' said the source , who spoke on condition he was not identified . \nNATO said it had carried out air strikes on Thursday in the vicinity of Sirte and Bani Walid . \nIn Libya 's third largest city Misrata , rebels said they were reinforcing security to intercept Gaddafi supporters trying to infiltrate the area from their haven in Sirte . \n`` There are Gaddafi scouts everywhere , '' said Ibrahim Obaid , a rebel fighter . \nThe NTC 's reconstruction minister , Ahmad Jehani , and Aref Nayed , a member of the council 's rebuilding team , met experts in post-conflict rebuilding from groups including the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and USAID in Paris on Friday . \nU.S. and French officials said the meeting was mainly about listening to the council 's needs . \nThe rebel officials said Libya is counting on quickly restoring oil production to revive its economy . \nFive foreign oil firms are already back and working to resume operations . \n`` The issue of damage is not much and you can get procurement very fast . \nThis is helped by the fact the producing wells are under contract to international firms , if they feel they can deploy their people , '' Jehani said . \nDespite having access to some of the tens of billions of dollars Gaddafi had invested abroad , the new leaders will also need short-term aid and longer-term loans to help stave off a humanitarian crisis . \nIn order for Libya 's new leaders to obtain aid from bodies such as the World Bank , they will need to be recognized by the IMF , which says such a move must be supported by its 187 members . \nThough dozens of countries have followed the Western powers in recognizing the NTC as Libya 's legitimate government , others have had qualms about the use of NATO force to oust Gaddafi . \nMany African and developing countries are still uneasy with a process that reminds some of the U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , even if Western leaders are at extreme pains to deny any plan to send in troops or run Libya for the Libyans . \nForeign Minister Antonio Patriota of Brazil , which has not recognized the NTC said this month 's U.N. General Assembly would settle the matter of recognition . \nThe European Union 's Official Journal listed 28 Libyan entities freed from EU sanctions as work gets under way to send in supplies and export oil through ports previously controlled by Gaddaf . \nEU foreign ministers meeting in Poland were to discuss how to help to stabilize Libya . \nEuropean powers ended a long standoff with Gaddafi in recent years as he scaled back hostility in return for the development of oil and gas exports . \nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Europe saw the new Libya as a major energy supplier and ally . \n`` Libya is potentially a wealthy country , key because of Europe 's drive to diversify energy sources . '' \nThe huge numbers of weapons circulating in a postwar Libya with unsecured borders pose a risk to Europe and other nations , the European Union 's senior representative in Tripoli said . \nAgostino Miozzo , special representative of EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton , told Reuters the bloc wanted to see the NTC tackle the security problem by swiftly establishing control over its borders and reorganizing the armed forces . \n-LRB- Reporting by Christian Lowe and Mohammed Abbas in Tripoli , Maria Golovnina in Misrata , Emma Farge , Sherine El Madany and Alex Dziadosz in Benghazi , Stephen Addison in London , John Irish and Catherine Bremer in Paris , Gabriela Baczynska and David Brunnstrom in Sopot , Poland , Tsvetelia Tsolova in Sofia , Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Alastair Macdonald in Tunis ; Writing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe is a commander without soldiers but a selfish coward who persistently asks his loyalist followers to die for him . \nNow even compatriot Syria refused to broadcast his message and he has to count on unmanned satellite . \nThis could 've happened much earlier if only Obama was willing to get more involved . \nsee world , that 's the manipulation . \nWhat happened to the other 30 somthing messages ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict . \n`` Sexual violence has become a tactic of choice for armed groups , being cheaper , more destructive and easier to get away with than other methods of warfare , '' she told a news briefing . \nWallstrom , making her first speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council since taking up the post in March 2010 , called for all countries caught up in conflict to prevent such war crimes and prosecute soldiers or commanders under suspicion . \n`` Violence against women is no more permissible in times of war than it is in times of peace . \nAnd yet , in contemporary conflicts , women and girls are the primary targets of sexual violence , including as a tactic of war , '' she told the forum . \nHer office is drawing up a blacklist to ` name and shame ' states who may be subject to Security Council sanctions , under a resolution adopted last December , according to Wallstrom . \nIt will probably start with Democratic Republic of the Congo , where at least 200,000 women and girls have been abused , although some estimates are 20 times that figure , she said . \nIn Liberia , which is recovering from 14 years of intermittent civil war in which rape was rampant , it is still the most reported crime , she said . \nInternational Criminal Court investigators have evidence linking Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents and may bring separate charges on the issue , ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday . \nCherif Bassiouni , head of a U.N. rights inquiry which went to areas controlled by both rebels and Gaddafi , appeared to cast doubt on the ICC report Thursday , although his team 's report accused government forces of murder , torture and abduction . \nBassiouni said each side had accused the other of deploying fighters armed with impotency drugs to carry out rapes , creating what he called a `` massive hysteria '' in Libya . \nHis team uncovered only four alleged cases -- Eman Al-Obaidi who claimed she was gang-raped by pro-government militiamen and three women in Misrata who said they had been sexually abused . \n`` Can we draw a conclusion that there is a systematic policy of rape ? \nIn my opinion we ca n't , '' Bassiouni said . \n`` For the time being , the numbers are very limited . '' \nBut Wallstrom , a former Swedish minister , said information collected by her office backed Moreno-Ocampo 's view . \n`` Everything we see and hear reported points to that , '' she told reporters . \n`` What we have is consistent reports from people , from organizations , from U.N. entities and others on the ground , '' she added . \n`` It is difficult to give you a figure , but this is part of the arsenal , the weaponry that Gaddafi 's troops use . '' \nSharia-inspired laws in Libya and Sudan that can be used to punish a rape victim should be scrapped , Wallstrom said . \n`` I understand in their -LRB- Libyan -RRB- legislation for example , you could be flogged . \nVery often women who report rape can themselves be accused of adultery or risk this kind of punishment , '' she said , adding that Sudan allows stoning . \nPolitical leaders must ensure that laws are modern and women do not run a risk in just reporting a rape , she said . \n`` That is what they all have to look at so it is not stone-age legislation as well that will prevent women from actually coming forward . \nThey will never get the reports on rape if this is the risk that women run .

'' \nThe accounts in Zlitan and Gadamis could not be independently verified and the Gaddafi government did not immediately comment . \nIn the besieged port city of Misrata , a doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in government shelling on Friday . \nThe fighting comes after the United States accused some NATO allies on Friday of failing to pull their weight in the campaign against Muammar Gaddafi 's forces , as the Libyan leader kept up shelling of the rebel-held town of Misrata . \n`` The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly-armed regime in a sparsely-populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the U.S. , once more , to make up the difference , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a valedictory speech at NATO headquarters in Brussels . \nGates 's exasperation has been echoed by rebels , who control the east of the country and some other areas but do not appear to pose an imminent threat to Gaddafi 's rule . \nTurkey , which is a member of NATO , said Gaddafi had no way out , but to leave Libya and offered the him an exit . \n`` We ourselves have offered him this guarantee , via the representatives we 've sent . \nWe told him we would help him to be sent wherever he wanted to be sent . \nWe would discuss the issue with our allies , according to the response we receive . \nUnfortunately we still have n't got a response from Gaddafi . '' \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton , appearing at the Abu Dhabi meeting of the Libya contact group on Thursday , said talks were under way with people close to Gaddafi who had raised the `` potential '' for a transition of power but added : `` There is not any clear way forward yet . '' \nUnder pressure to come up with plans for a transitional government while still in disarray , the rebels have said the onus is on foreign powers to hasten assistance . \n`` Our people are dying , '' rebel Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said . \n`` So my message to our friends is that I hope they walk the walk . '' \nGaddafi describes the rebels as al Qaeda terrorists and says foreign intervention is a front for a grab at the country 's oil . \nMikhail Margelov , Russia 's Africa envoy , who traveled to Benghazi on Friday , said he would go to Tripoli as soon as NATO provided a corridor through its Libyan no-fly zone . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey are killing civilians maybe more than Gaddafi . \nThey have more arsenal than Gaddafi and have all air power , Gaddafi has none . \nThey are now aided with Money with a more ONE LOPSIDEDNESS cause than before . \nYou better believe that NO ONE would be leaving Gaddafi to stand alone if NATO was not there for the rebels . \nPeople only leave Gaddafi only because there is only one outcome from this awesome one sided unjustified intervention by NATO and the us . \nNATO has tied Gaddafi 's hands behind his back , plucked out his eyes and are aiding the rebels against the crippled Gaddafi . \nNATO should be exposed for what they are , immoral cowards . \n`` At the United Nations , the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- said its investigators had found evidence linking Gaddafi to a policy of raping opponents .

{"id": "222", "time": "2011-06-28", "text": "WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 28 , 2011 6:30 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday approved a resolution formally authorizing continued U.S. participation in the NATO-led military intervention in Libya but banning the introduction of U.S. troops on the ground there . \nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote marked another round in the debate in Washington over who has the power to make war , sparked by the President Barack Obama 's decision to commit the United States to the Libya conflict in March without asking the U.S. Congress ' approval . \nThe committee voted 14-5 to approve the measure offered by Senator John Kerry , a Democrat , and Senator John McCain , a Republican , both supporters of the Libya intervention . \nBut the House of Representatives has already rejected a similar measure , reflecting the division in Congress over the issue and narrowing the chances that the Kerry-McCain resolution , which first has to be approved by the full Senate , will ever become law . \nWhile the Obama administration would like Congress to express support for the Libya mission , it says it does not strictly need formal authorization by Congress . \nThis is because the U.S. military role in the NATO-led Libya operations has been limited , not rising to the level of war or `` hostilities '' under U.S. law , U.S. officials say . \nThis legalistic position , which was explained again to the committee in detail earlier Tuesday by State Department lawyer Harold Koh , has angered or annoyed many in both parties in Congress -- even some of those who support the Libya action . \nBefore passing the resolution , the senators effectively repudiated the administration 's argument by adopting an amendment that said continuation of the Libya operations does require congressional authorization . \nALL THOSE WHO VOTED NO WERE REPUBLICANS The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission in March , aiming to prevent Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians opposed to his rule . \nThe mission , NATO-led since the end of March , now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . \nThe panel 's vote in favor of the resolution was a bipartisan 10 Democrats and four Republicans . \nAll those who voted against the measure were Republicans , including the panel 's top Republican , Richard Lugar , who cited the U.S. debt and two other wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as reasons not to wage war in Libya . \n`` In light of these circumstances , the lack of U.S. vital interest in Libya , I do not believe that we should be intervening in a civil war there , '' Lugar said . \nKerry said that now was not the time to bail out of Libya , with Gaddafi `` bunkered down in Tripoli '' and facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court . \n`` Do we want to stop this operation ? \nThat 's really what it comes down to , '' Kerry said ahead of the vote . \nThe resolution would authorize the U.S. role in Libya for up to one year after the date of enactment of the resolution by Congress , unless the NATO mission ends sooner . \nIt also says that the removal of Gaddafi is a political goal of U.S. policy , and calls for the United States and NATO to be reimbursed for the costs of the operation from assets seized from Gaddafi 's government . \nSenator Bob Corker , a Republican who voted against the resolution , said the administration was basically `` sticking a stick in the eye '' of Congress by finding a narrow legal reason not to ask for authorization . \n`` The chairman mentioned -LRB- that -RRB- since no American is being shot , there 's no hostilities . \nBy that reasoning we could drop a nuclear bomb on Tripoli and we would not be involved in hostilities , and this goes to the sort of preposterous argument that is being made , '' Corker said . \nSenator Jim Webb , a Democrat , agreed the administration 's argument that the Libyan conflict is not `` hostilities '' was `` contorted , '' but he voted for the authorization resolution . \nKoh , in his appearance before the committee , declined to comment on reports that Obama ignored the advice of Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers who argued that U.S. military intervention in Libya required congressional authorization . \nSince NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes fired at targets . \nThirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . \nThe United States has also been providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission . \nThe committee voted down , 14-5 , a proposal by Lugar that would have ruled out U.S. participation in any more air strikes . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nSo they are weak on not only taking care of our military personnel but they are weak on defense . \nFirst they could n't find Bin laden and now this . \nhaha This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe military detention facility , its facade peppered with bullet holes , was set up by the rebels early in the conflict to house government troops captured during fighting around Libya . \nMost of the 75 detainees are soldiers and officers but a handful of people , like Abdullah , were civilians . \nSnatched as Gaddafi loyalists in the confusion of the early days of the conflict , they are now stuck in limbo , unable to prove their loyalties and go back to their families . \nSome , like Abdullah , are bitter and disillusioned . \n`` No one has been charged with anything here . \nWe have been told that we are here for security reasons , as POWs , '' Abdullah , who asked not to use his surname , said in fluent English . \n`` Once I talked to my family . \nOnce , a month ago . \nI spoke to my brother . \nWe were instructed not to give any information about how we are being treated . \nI told them I am okay , in a safe place , that 's it , '' he added . \nFor their captors , they are the inevitable victims of a messy and protracted war . \nPrison authorities have promised to release everyone -- both civilians and soldiers -- once the war is over and there is a proper mechanism for their departure . \n`` They all come from their tribes . \nWhen Gaddafi dies or flees , we will have a big tribal meeting and people will come here from their tribes and they will take their people away , '' said Captain Tariq Muftah , 40 , a senior prison warden . \nBefore becoming a prison , the facility housed administrative offices under Gaddafi 's rule , rebels said . \nBroken furniture was scattered around its crumbling rooms and corridors when Reuters was allowed to visit it this week . \nSmall cells housing up to five men lined the main corridor . \nDetainees sat in their cells on old striped rugs and blankets . \nSurrounded by heaps of clothes and rubbish , they stared blankly at passing visitors through iron bars . \nSome smoked and played cards . \nFlies buzzed around in the thick , stale air . \nPictures of helicopter gunships were scribbled on the walls . \nPeople 's faces were gaunt . \nSome refused to speak altogether . \nGritting his teeth and unable to hold back his tears , one man , his eyes swollen and cheeks drawn , whispered that he used to be a fighter pilot . \nThen he turned away to face the wall . \nPrison wardens accompanying Reuters confirmed people 's stories . \nReuters was not allowed to take video or still images . \nSitting on a grubby mattress in the corridor , Abdusalam Osman , 23 , said he was working in a car parts workshop near Ajdabiyah when he was seized by Gaddafi soldiers in March . \nHe said he was subsequently released and returned to the rebel-held east , only to be detained this time by rebel forces suspicious of his experience while in government detention . \n`` I am not a soldier . \nI work in a workshop fixing cars . \nSo now we are here , '' he said , pointing at three other men sitting nearby who he said were also civilians from his home town . \n`` Revolutionaries caught me . \nThey said : We are not sure you are on our side , you are coming from Gaddafi 's side , so you are going to prison . \nI believe in the revolution . \nEvery day they tell me : Tomorrow you will be released , '' he added with a shrug . \nHuman Rights Watch , whose researchers have visited the facility , said prisoners were generally being treated well . \n`` There have been some problems at the point of capture . \nA few detainees told us they were mistreated or shot after they were caught on the frontlines ... , '' Sidney Kwiram of Human Rights Watch told Reuters . \n`` It is critical that the opposition authorities demonstrate unambiguous leadership on how to treat captured Gaddafi forces and that they continue to underline their message about humane treatment , including to their fighters on the frontlines .

'' Ashour Shamis , a UK-based Libyan opposition activist , said Hamidi played a key role in Gaddafi 's war against the rebels . \n`` He is very much there , controlling the army and supervising military activities , '' he said . \nNATO continued its three-month campaign of air strikes on Monday . \nA Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion . \nThere were no details immediately available on what was hit . \nThe rebels have made slow progress since NATO countries joined the fight three months ago , but are now advancing towards Tripoli from a bastion in Misrata east of the capital and from the Western Mountains region to its southwest . \nA child was killed and two others were wounded when three rockets fired by Gaddafi forces hit a built-up area near the port in Misrata on Monday , a Reuters reporter said . \nA rebel at the scene named Hassan Douwa said : `` Is NATO waiting for Gaddafi to kill us all before it does its job ? \nGive us the planes and we will do it ourselves . '' \nA rebel spokesman in Misrata said on Monday NATO had been increasingly using Apache helicopters to target Gaddafi forces near the city . \nRebels in the Western Mountains said they had shut off a pipeline that supplies crude from an oilfield in the south to the Zawiyah refinery near the capital Tripoli . \nThe refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi-held areas . \n`` This is an attempt by the rebels to stifle the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli , '' rebel spokesman Juma Ibrahim said by phone from the Western Mountains town of Zintan . \nRebels have been boosted by defections of Gaddafi loyalists . \nThey said on Monday 22 soldiers had defected from a unit in the south . \nGaddafi officials say defections have not made a significant dent in government forces . \nRebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril is due on Tuesday to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition . \nEU foreign ministers agreed at their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday to look into the possibility of using frozen Libyan funds to assist the rebels . \nThe rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on Saturday of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four-month campaign to unseat Gaddafi . \nIn a joint statement they said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council , which needs more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in the next six months . \n"}

'' \nThere was no way for reporters to verify that all the bodies they were shown came from the building . \n`` NATO is looking into reports of civilian casualties following NATO air strikes in the early hours of June 19 , '' the alliance said in a statement from Naples , from where it is running the Libyan operation . \n`` The incident is said to have occurred in a residential area in northern Tripoli , following a deliberate strike which targeted a missile site operated by pro-Gaddafi forces . \n`` NATO regrets any loss of civilian lives , and is doing all it can to protect the people of Libya from the violence waged by the Gaddafi regime . \n`` We take all reports of civilian casualties very seriously and we will continue to look into the facts related to this event , '' the alliance said . \n`` NATO would be sorry if the review of this incident did indicate that it was caused by a NATO weapon .

'' \nOn at least one occasion in the past , doubts have emerged about the reliability of Libyan claims of civilian casualties . \nIn one case , Libyan officials presented a wounded child to foreign media as the victim of an air strike but medical staff passed a note to a foreign journalist saying she was hurt in a road accident . \nIf it is proved that Sunday 's deaths were caused by a NATO air strike , it would be the first acknowledged incident of its kind in the campaign and could weaken the fragile resolve of some countries in the alliance . \nNATO has been pounding targets in Libya for months in what it says is an operation to protect civilians who rebelled against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule . \nThe Libyan leader says it is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal oil . \nStrains are appearing within NATO member states as the campaign drags on for longer than most of its backers anticipated and Gaddafi remains in power -- even making a show of defiance last week by playing chess with a visiting official . \nSunday marked three months since NATO warplanes went into action over Libya . \nRebels from the city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have been trying to push west towards the capital but on Sunday they took heavy casualties when they came under fire from pro-Gaddafi forces . \nA doctor at a field hospital near the frontline in Dafniyah , just west of Misrata , said eight fighters had been killed and 36 wounded . \nA Reuters reporter at the field hospital said he saw a procession of pick-up trucks arriving from the front carrying the wounded and the dead , some of them covered with blankets . \n`` Gaddafi 's forces were underground -LRB- in trenches -RRB- . \nWe were patrolling and they ambushed us , '' said rebel fighter Mohammed Swelhi , whose friend , Mustafa , was one of two bodies brought from the front in the back of a truck . \n`` My cousin was injured yesterday . \nAnd today my friend was killed . \nMy group , we 're all close friends , '' he said . \nLast week , NATO aircraft dropped leaflets around the frontline warning pro-Gaddafi fighters they would be targeted by attack helicopters if they did not lay down their arms . \nBut rebels say there has been little sign of the alliance . \n`` We do n't know what NATO is doing , '' said the doctor , called Nury , who was tending the wounded at the field hospital . \nAfter four months of civil war , rebels control the eastern third of Libya , the Mediterranean port city of Misrata and much of the Western Mountains stretching to the border with Tunisia . \nBut they remain far from seizing Gaddafi 's powerbase of Tripoli and its hinterland despite air support from the world 's most powerful military alliance . \nSpeaking in the eastern city of Benghazi , the chief rebel oil official castigated Western powers for failing to make good on their promises to help the rebel cause . \n`` We are running out of everything . \nIt 's a complete failure . \nEither they -LRB- Western nations -RRB- do n't understand or they do n't care . \nNothing has materialised yet . \nAnd I really mean nothing , '' Ali Tarhouni said in an interview with Reuters . \n`` All of these people we talk to , all of these countries , at all these conferences , with their great grand speeches -- we appreciate -LRB- them -RRB- ... but in terms of finances they are a complete failure . \nOur people are dying , '' he said . \n"}

'' \nAlgerian officials said Gaddafi 's second wife Safia , along with her daughter Aisha and son Hannibal , as well as Mohammed , a son of Gaddafi by his first wife , crossed the border on Monday , August 29 . \nThat Aisha , an international lawyer in her mid-30s , was about to give birth was a critical factor in letting them in . \nThe child , a girl , was born almost immediately , in the early hours of Tuesday , at the Efiri clinic , a simple medical facility on the outskirts of Djanet . \nAisha and her new baby spent a second night in the town , at a secluded house , but then left . \nA source in Algeria who was aware of arrangements for the Gaddafis but was not authorised to discuss them , told Reuters the family was now staying discreetly in the empty southeast of the country , probably in Illizi province , a territory the size of Italy with a population of only 50,000 . \n`` Aisha is still in the area , '' the source said . \n`` I believe she is in Illizi province . '' \nThe family will not find in the desert the sort of luxury lifestyle that has been revealed in the past fortnight in their abandoned homes in Tripoli . \nDjanet has little to tempt the traveler . \nWith midday summer temperatures hitting 50 degrees Celsius -LRB- 120 Fahrenheit -RRB- in the shade , dusty chairs and tables stand in nearly empty cafes . \nHistorically a watering stop for camel trains crossing Africa 's great desert , it is now a scattering of flat-roofed brown houses among palm groves that creep up the boulder-strewn slopes of a low hill on which French colonial legionnaires built a small strongpoint , Fort Charlet , a century ago . \nWhile there was no shortage of friction between Algiers and Tripoli during the four-decades of Gaddafi 's rule -- including a dispute over the border near Djanet -- the two countries share a post-colonial suspicion of Western power which fostered a certain solidarity between Gaddafi and Algeria 's ruling elite . \n`` Libya , a brother nation , is a nation with an ancestral history , a neighbouring people with whom we share a glorious past and a radiant future , '' Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in defending giving shelter to the Gaddafis -- a move Libya 's new rulers called an act of aggression . \nThe government has ruled out taking in Gaddafi himself . \nGaddafi 's whereabouts are not known , but one of his remaining bastions of support in Libya is Sabha , a 500 km -LRB- 300 mile -RRB- drive across the desert from Djanet . \nAlgerian officials said Gaddafi called them and said he was in Ghadames , close to the border further north . \nHundreds of Libyans from Sabha and as from as far away as Tripoli have come to Djanet and other villages in Illizi , residents said , adding that many were supporters of Gaddafi . \nThey are keeping a low profile . \nWhen a Reuters reporter approached a group of people residents identified as visitors from Libya , they declined to speak . \nAlgerians say they are trying to accommodate the incomers as best they can , despite their own limited means . \nThe shopkeeper , Safi , said he had hosted a man he described as a cousin of Gaddafi in his home and sympathised with the plight of those fleeing their homeland . \n`` Some Libyans have lost everything overnight , it is a tragedy for most of them , '' he said . \n`` They never thought they would one day be refugees . '' \nAlgeria has now closed the southern part of its border with Libya , according to a security source at the Debdeb crossing , near Ghadames . \nThe source said hundreds of Libyans entered Algeria in the days before the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council put up its red , green and black flag on the Libyan frontier post . \n`` Now that the NTC controls the border , it is difficult for Gaddafi and his aides to get to Algeria , '' the source said . \nAlgeria is the only one of Libya 's North African neighbors yet to recognize the NTC as Libya 's new authorities . \nIt says it will do so once there is a representative government . \nAlgerian officials say they are particularly concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated the NTC and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . \nHowever , many Algerians have criticised the government for failing to embrace the anti-Gaddafi movement in Libya . \nAlgerians have followed the conflict closely , and many share the view of others in the Arab world that Gaddafi was a despot . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe leader Aisha saw the death of his daughter Mastura , her brother Saif el Arab Gaddafi on the NATO bombing -LRB- 01-05-2011 -RRB- , his husband and love of her life Abu Ahmed Meniar and other compatriots . \nWe admire their courage . \nAisha is the leader of the Resistance , HOPE of the Libyan people . \nAisha is an Arab woman , dignified , professional , highly qualified and fighter , great personality , Ambassador of Peace by the United Nations and consistent with Arab culture , participated in the defense of Hussein , whom was never proven that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . \nThe invasion of Iraq was also a slander to seize the oil wells . \nNATO members are oppressing the Libyan people FORCED into profitable contracts for transnational corporations of West . \nThis theft of natural resources has had a high cost greater than the 50000 deaths Libyans . \nHaving great strength and keeping her family together in this time of great suffering , AISHA Gaddafi . \nYou are the hope of the Libyan people . \nDo n't give up on Ghaddafi yet . \nHe is a survivor . \nMany British politicians like Galloway have exposed the lies and deception of NATO . \nThe war continues while media blackout has been introduced . \nHave you noticed the lack of direct media reports from Lybia since the end of August ? \nThey want you to believe that all is fine while Lybia descends into civil war . \nGhaddafi is smart by opting for guerilla warfare . \nWhen NATO pulls back he will be ready to return . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIt is unlikely militants could steal the whole system and fire the missile . \nThere was no sign at the site of any of the liquid fuel that propels the missile . \nThis is stored separately because it is corrosive , and it has to be loaded into the missile before firing . \n`` It is not useful to a militant unless they have a source of liquid fuel nearby , '' said Joshi . \nOperating the missile also requires skilled technicians , he said , but it is theoretically possible that al Qaeda could find these . \nAfter the Red Army pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989 , mujahideen fighters -- some of whom later joined al Qaeda -- obtained stocks of Soviet Scuds and learned how to fire them . \n`` Clearly sometimes insurgent fighters can use Scud missiles , '' said Joshi . \nIn an interview with Reuters on Friday , the senior European Union representative in Tripoli said the bloc was concerned that Islamist militants could obtain weapons in Libya and take them out across the country 's largely unpoliced borders . \n`` This is an evident risk , '' said EU envoy Agostino Miozzo . \nThe NTC -- preoccupied with trying to catch Gaddafi , defeat his supporters in their remaining strongholds , and deal with shortages of fuel and water -- says securing the arms is a priority but not something that can be done straight away . \n`` Of course we are in a state of war , and Gaddafi definitely left some weapons and mines , '' General Omar Hariri , one of the interim government 's senior military commanders , told reporters in Tripoli last week . \n`` We have a group of military engineers who are specialized in finding out and digging out such weapons and such mines and it is only a matter of days before we are clearing all of these mines and gathering Gaddafi 's weapons , '' he said . \n`` We are still in a state of war so it 's very normal , it 's very natural . '' \nThe Scud site is next to a highway leading east out of Tripoli and a short distance from a depot operated by U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger . \nIt provided a glimpse of how Gaddafi 's forces had planned to use their military hardware for a last-ditch fight and then , when defeat became inevitable , hurriedly abandoned their posts . \nIn total there were four mobile missile launchers parked within a radius of about 500 metres -LRB- yards -RRB- at the site . \nAll the launchers had been covered to mask them from NATO warplanes -- they were draped in camouflage netting and parked under trees or sunk into trenches which local people said had been dug out by an excavator . \nOnly one of the launchers had a missile mounted on it . \nIt was not clear what had happened to the other rockets , though it appears they had not been used in the conflict . \n`` We do not know , '' said Abdelmounem Sabri , another colonel attached to the anti-Gaddafi military facility 15 km away . \nOne of the launchers , without a missile on it , had been destroyed by a NATO air strike , leaving just a charred skeleton and scorching the eucalyptus tree it had been parked next to . \nScattered in the sand around the launcher that was still loaded with a missile were about half a dozen anti-personnel mines , which appeared to have been dropped by the crew in their rush to leave . \nThe canvas bags used to carry the mines were lying nearby . \nColonel Derbek , giving a tour of the site , picked one of the mines up and nonchalantly waved it in the air . \nAll of the intact Scud launchers seemed to be in working order . \nDozens of cans of grease were thrown on the ground next to them , evidence that the crews had been keeping their mechanisms oiled and ready for action . \nAt the armed launcher , the hydraulic control cables were plugged in to their sockets . \nThe console that controls the stabilizer jacks on the launcher -- used to hold the unit steady for firing -- was attached by cables and sitting in the sand , ready to use . \nThe crews had been living in a half-finished house a short distance away , most likely because they feared NATO strikes and did not want to camp right next to the Scud battery . \nAt the house , there were more signs of a hasty departure . \nA traditional Arab water pipe was still primed with scented tobacco . \nOn flimsy mattresses on the floor lay strewn razors , deodorant , toothbrushes and a pack of vitamin C tablets . \nWhere the crews have gone , taking with them their expertise and , possibly , a grudge against Libya 's new rulers , is anyone 's guess . \nFive pairs of olive drab combat pants and six fatigue jackets lay at the site -- Gaddafi 's missile-men seemed to have changed into civilian clothes and melted into the population . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nGuess where the high-bidders -LRB- financed by the Iranians -RRB- are coming from , and where the missile is going to wind up ? \nYup , along the borders of Israel . \nQaddafi was a better deal ... What evidence do you have to support those claims ? \nBaseless conjecture and denigrating an entire movement , began out of desire for freedom , is abhorrent . \nAnd your idea of a `` better '' deal is to allow a ruthless dictator to oppress and murder his people rather than stand for democracy , freedom , and other rights you so callously take for granted and even have the gall to say other human beings are not entitled too ? \nIt is quite a poor reflection of yourself when you would choose for innocent human beings to be subjected to tyranny instead of building a functional state , that can prevent future arms smuggling and -- more importantly -- serve the interests of its people . \nThe arrogance and near-savagery of your comment is astounding . \nAutocracy over democracy , really ? \nAnd the `` better deal '' is the gauge of your interests over the Libyan people , who would face the consequence and not you . \nTo those who can not , or will not learn from the past . \nWhy do we not learn from the Iraq stock piles of wepons left ungraded , or not destroyed , these are turned into IED 'S . \nThis has happened through out history . \nThe wepons will be sold , and in that part of the world guess who would want them . \nThere are many in africa alone . \nAfghanistan began as a desire for freedom . \nArrogance is Archinosin inability , or refusal to learn from the past . \nLiberals like you are the root cause for a majority of issues in the world today . \nI have served as a US Marine from Ohio and have fought so you may make the statement you just made . \nPlease think before speaking is all I ask . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` Clearly it 's a matter of moving from the current situation in which there are many people with weapons who are fighting in this conflict to one where there is a single public security force and the kind of proper state army that did n't exist in Libya in the past , '' he said . \n`` I 've just been discussing with the Minister of the Interior the challenge that they face in terms of public security , in terms of getting police more fully back on the streets and weapons off the streets and building a democratically accountable police force .

'' \nSalabi said he planned to send a memo to the NTC and its foreign allies to warn them to ensure that Libyan assets abroad , frozen to punish Gaddafi and now being released to the NTC , do not come back under control of the same officials who once handled them for Gaddafi . \n`` Lately , the -LRB- NTC -RRB- executive committee has done nothing but talk about unfreezing the assets , '' he said . \n`` These were in the names of individuals in the old regime , so if you unfreeze the assets you unfreeze them in their favor . \nThey belong to the Libyan people . '' \nBig powers agreed in Paris last week to unfreeze $ 15 billion in Libyan assets once controlled by Gaddafi or his aides . \nLibya 's total foreign assets are estimated at some $ 170 billion . \nThe influx of money will test the capacity and intentions of Libya 's new leaders , who are trying to restore order and public services in an oil-rich country with a glut of guns and forge a new brand of democratic politics after 42 years of one-man rule . \n`` We are asking the international community and NTC to be very , very careful , '' said Salabi , a former businessman who spent time in jail in the Gaddafi era . \nA senior NTC member said the unfrozen funds would be spent on education , security and medical care for landmine victims . \nSalabi said his fighters , hardened by six months of combat with Gaddafi 's forces , would join any battle for the coastal city of Sirte , voicing scepticism that it would surrender . \nBut he said the February 17 brigade would respect deadlines set by the NTC , which has given more time for talks on a peaceful handover of the city that sits on an east-west coastal highway . \n`` With our in-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of the commanders of the forces at Sirte , we feel that unfortunately force will be the only means , '' he said . \n`` I do not believe that the tribal elders will carry weight with that leadership .

'' \nAs the uprising entered its third week , the exact situation on the ground was often hard for reporters to assess due to the difficulties of moving around some parts of the desert nation and patchy communications . \nBut witnesses in Misrata , a city of a half a million people 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- to the east of Tripoli , and Zawiyah , a strategic refinery town 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- to the west , said government forces were mounting or preparing attacks . \n`` An aircraft was shot down this morning while it was firing on the local radio station . \nProtesters captured its crew , '' a witness in Misrata , Mohamed , told Reuters by telephone . \nA battle for the military air base was also under way , he said , although a Libyan government source denied the report . \nA resident of Zawiyah called Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone that brigades commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis were on the outskirts of the town and looked ready to attack . \nIn Tripoli , Gaddafi 's last stronghold , several people were killed and others wounded on Monday when forces loyal to Gaddafi opened fire to disperse a protest in Tajoura neighborhood , Morocco 's Quryna newspaper reported . \nThe protest gathered close to 10,000 protesters , the Libyan newspaper said , quoting its correspondent . \n`` When the protesters reached the Souk Juma -LRB- market -RRB- , they were joined by armed men from the Gaddafi battalion who were dressed as civilians and opened fire on the unarmed youths . \nMany among the youths were wounded and killed , '' it said . \nIn Tripoli , queues outside bakeries and soaring rice and flour prices fuelled public anger . \n`` There is n't enough food , '' said Basim , 25 , a bank employee , adding that many workers in the public sector had yet to receive salaries for February . \nCrowds of people also massed outside state banks , which have started distributing handouts of about $ 400 per family in an effort by Gaddafi 's government to drum up support . \nForeign governments increased the pressure on Gaddafi to leave in the hope of ending fighting that has claimed at least 1,000 lives and restoring order to a country that accounts for 2 percent of the world 's oil production . \nThe U.N. Security Council on Saturday slapped sanctions on Gaddafi and other Libyan officials , imposed an arms embargo and froze Libyan assets . \nEuropean Union governments approved their sanctions against Gaddafi in Brussels on Monday . \nThe United States , whose Sixth Fleet operates out of Italy , said it was moving U.S. naval and air forces closer to Libya and working on various contingency plans . \n`` We 're still in that planning and preparing mode should we be called upon to do any of those types of missions , whether humanitarian and otherwise , '' Pentagon spokesman Colonel David Lapan said in Washington . \nPrime Minister Cameron , speaking in parliament , urged Gaddafi to step down and said all measures would be considered to pressure him to go . \n`` We do not in any way rule out the use of military assets , '' Cameron said . \n`` I have asked the Ministry of Defense and the Chief of the Defense Staff to work with our allies on plans for a military no-fly zone . '' \nAustralian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said his government would ask the United Nations to approve a no-fly zone . \nForeign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy -- formerly Libya 's closest ally in Europe -- told Reuters a no-fly zone was a useful measure . \nItaly would consider allowing allies to use its bases but the Security Council must first approve the measure , he said . \nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen distanced himself from talk of an imminent implementation , saying the Security Council resolution excluded the use of armed forces and did not mention a no-fly zone . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that Gaddafi was using `` mercenaries and thugs '' to repress his people and that he must step down immediately . \nRevolutions in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt have helped to ignite resentment of four decades of often bloody political repression under Gaddafi as well as his failure to use Libya 's oil wealth to tackle widespread poverty and lack of opportunity . \nRegional experts expect rebels eventually to take the capital and kill or capture Gaddafi but say he has the firepower to foment chaos or civil war . \nOpposition forces are largely in control of Libya 's oil facilities , which are mostly located in the east . \nIndustry reports suggested Libya 's oil output had been halved as expatriate workers pulled out , Fatih Birol , chief economist of the International Energy Agency , said . \nBank of America Merrill Lynch estimated in a note to clients that Libya was losing about 1.2 million barrels per day , or 75 percent of its pre-revolt output , and said the unrest could mean Libyan supplies were unavailable for months . \nIndustry sources said actual shipments were at a standstill . \nBrent crude was around $ 112 a barrel in choppy trading . \nWealthy states have sent planes and ships to bring home expatriate workers but many more , from poorer countries , are stranded . \nThe United Nations refugee agency said nearly 100,000 people have fled the violence in a growing humanitarian crisis . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBoys with guns -RRB- Civil war -RRB- Atrocities -RRB- generations of instability . \nHow useless is the Arab League ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

I am tired of asking them . '' \nHe had earlier estimated the rebels were spending up to 100 million Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 86 million -RRB- per day . \n`` I do n't expect us to produce oil any time soon . \nThe refineries have no crude oil , so they are not working , '' he said . \n`` People died for this revolution and are still dying . \nWe will find a way -LRB- to raise money -RRB- . \nOne thing is for sure : We will never give up . '' \nSupplies of fuel , vital to keeping eastern towns supplied and maintaining the campaign against Gaddafi , are tight . \nTarhouni said that refineries , including the one in Misrata , and other crucial installations had been damaged by the fighting , but the pipelines were still intact . \nLibya produced 1.6 million barrels per day before the war and exported about 1.3 million bpd . \nRebels sold their first tanker full of crude to U.S. refiner Tesoro in April , but production has since ground to a halt due to concerns over the security of the oil fields . \nRebels now rely on imports of fuel . \nAsked about the mechanism of deliveries , Tarhouni said : `` We have signed -LRB- fuel supply -RRB- contracts and we have companies that were gracious enough to delay those payments for the future . \n`` We get it -LRB- fuel -RRB- basically from these contractors . \nI personally do n't know where they get it from , but I think it 's just from the spot market , most of it . \nThe companies are international companies .

Libyan government forces destroyed four fuel storage tanks and set several others ablaze in rebel-held Misrata , dealing a blow to the port city 's ability to withstand a government siege , rebels said on Saturday . \nThe bombardment of the western city came as artillery rounds fired by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fell in Tunisia in an escalation of fighting near the border with rebels trying to end Gaddafi 's rule of more than four decades . \nMisrata , the last remaining city in the west under rebel control , has been under siege for more than two months and has witnessed some of the war 's fiercest fighting . \nRebels gave varying accounts of the bombardment but said the attack hit fuel used for export as well as domestic consumption . \n`` Four -LRB- fuel -RRB- tanks were totally destroyed and a huge fire erupted which spread now to the other four . \nWe can not extinguish it because we do not have the right tools , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan told Reuters . \n`` Now the city will face a major problem . \nThose were the only sources of fuel for the city . \nThese tanks could have kept the city for three months with enough fuel , '' he said by telephone . \nVideo of the incident posted on YouTube by Libyan students in Misrata showed firefighters turning water hoses on a raging fire in a vain attempt to extinguish it . \nHassan said rebels notified NATO about the planes before the attack but there had been no response . \nGovernment forces last month flew at least one helicopter reconnaissance mission over Misrata , according to rebels . \nNATO coalition aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets and enforcing a no-fly zone under a U.N. resolution . \nWestern and Arab countries this week agreed to provide rebels with millions of dollars in non-military aid to help them keep services and the economy running . \nRebels have long been demanding they also need more heavy weapons to take on the Libyan leader 's better-armed and trained forces . \nOn Saturday , the rebels said they had reached an agreement with Italy to supply them with weapons , but the former colonial power denied the report . \nAbdel-Hafiz Ghoga , spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , told journalists at a news conference in Benghazi that the weapons would be supplied to the rebels soon . \nIn Rome , a Foreign Ministry spokesman said no such agreement had been reached . \n`` There has been no agreement to supply them with weapons , '' the spokesman told Reuters . \nItaly has thrown its full support behind the rebels , formally recognizing the transitional council as the only legitimate representatives of the country , but it is unlikely it would go further than other countries in the anti-Gaddafi coalition . \nFighting has intensified in Libya 's Western Mountains region as Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , backed by NATO bombing , reached stalemate on other fronts in the civil war . \nGovernment forces surrounding the rebel-held Zintan fired 300 rockets into the town on Saturday , rebel spokesman Abdulrahman al-Zintani said . \nHe gave no details of casualties in Zintan , which is largely empty of civilians . \n`` NATO aircraft can be heard but there have been no air strikes , '' al-Zintani told Reuters . \nThe Tunisian town of Dehiba has been hit repeatedly by stray shells in recent weeks , and on Saturday Tunisia condemned the `` extremely dangerous '' shelling and said it would take all necessary measures to protect its sovereignty . \nThe Libyan government denied it targeted Tunisian soil deliberately . \n`` We said this -LRB- shelling -RRB- was an error and we have apologized that this took place and have asked the military forces to ensure this does n't happen again , '' Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmoudi told a news conference in Tripoli . \nThe battle is for control of the Dehiba-Wazzin border crossing , which gives the rebels a road from the outside world into strongholds in the Western Mountains region . \nAlthough the rebels hold the border point , Gaddafi 's forces are in charge of a far bigger one to the north . \nOn Saturday Dehiba 's schools were evacuated and residents scurried for safety as close to 100 mortars and missiles fell . \nThe crackle of small arms fire as well as larger weapons could also be heard about 4 km -LRB- 2.5 miles -RRB- inside Libya , a Reuters witness on the border said . \n`` We are very afraid . \nThe missiles are falling right around us , we do n't know what to do , '' said Tunisian Mohammed Naguez , a resident of Dehiba . \n`` Our children are afraid . \nThe Tunisian authorities have to stop this . '' \nMost of the people in the Western Mountains belong to the Berber ethnic group and are distinct from other Libyans . \nThey rose up two months ago and say towns such as Zintan and Yafran are under repeated bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces , running short of food , water and medicine . \nThe civil war over Gaddafi 's rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . \nThe revolt is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa , which saw the overthrow of the veteran presidents of Tunisia and Egypt . \n-LRB- Reporting by Joseph Nasr in Berlin , Matt Robinson and Tarek Amara in Dehiba and Mariam Karouny in Beirut ; Writing by Matthew Bigg and Sonya Hepinstall ; Editing by Michael Roddy -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWhen the US supported the rebels they were moving forward -- now with NATO they seem to be getting less and less help as well as moving BACKWARDS . \nWhat 's up with NATO -- WAKE UP WAKE UP NATO -- the US provided help and you are asleep !!!

'' \nBut help might not arrive if Gaddafi 's son Khamees , who leads the army 's reportedly powerful 32nd Brigade , crushes advances on the approach roads to the city , he said . \nIn addition hundreds and possibly thousands of armed internal security agents in Tripoli would be on alert for any attempt by the opposition to quietly infiltrate armed men into the capital from outlying areas , security experts say . \nMilitary experts estimate Gaddafi can count on 10,000 to 12,000 troops , not counting loyalists in the security services and mercenaries . \nHe also controls Tripoli airport and the port . \nA standoff might give Gaddafi time to deploy economic or paramilitary means to shore up links with any tribes that have not yet declared themselves for the rebels . \nGADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , STARTS DESERT INSURGENCY London-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . \n`` It 's about staying alive . '' \n`` He will create conditions for guerrilla warfare , that 's why he invited Libyans to take weapons , '' he said . \nGaddafi may flee to the southern desert area of Sebha where his tribe is from and try to destabilise country from there . \nHe might also try to flee to his hometown of Sirte , but this may be too risky -- it is near the east , which is in rebel hands . \n`` Someone like him must have already made some hideouts in the desert , '' said Djebbar . \nGeoff Porter , an independent U.S. analyst , said he could envisage the crisis ending up as a `` manhunt , '' adding : `` He could well go to ground with loyal henchmen . \nSo he may fall from power , but his whereabouts may not be known for weeks . '' \nGADDAFI FLEES TRIPOLI , TRIBES AGREE TRUCE TO PREVENT CHAOS Djebbar said Gaddafi 's `` time is over . \nBut how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' \nHe said the amount of disruption that would follow a defeat of Gaddafi depended on the loyalty of his tribesmen and relatives . \nAt some stage , Gaddafi 's Gaddadfa tribe would decide to negotiate with other tribes and agree to cease hostilities . \nLibya expert Mansour El-Kikhia says rifts in the Gaddadfa had already opened up between loyalists and dissidents . \nThe Gaddadfa want to do everything to avoid being persecuted by vengeful authorities in a future post-Gaddafi Libya . \nAjleil said Libya was not in a phase of score-settling and the Gaddadfa were forgiven , Quryna said . \nGADDAFI FOMENTS A FULLY-FLEDGED CIVIL WAR This is seen at present as unlikely . \nBut Marks said he could envision a standoff between `` a weird sort of city state ruled by this rump of Gaddafi forces , and the rest of the country ruled by an opposition that lacks the clout to take the capital quickly . \nIf that endures , you may end up with a civil war . \nDjebbar said that the longer Gaddafi continued crushing protests , the more difficult it would be for his tribe to negotiate a peaceful settlement . \nGADDAFI IS TOPPLED , FLEES ABROAD Djebbar said he could envision Gaddafi 's closest relatives pushing him to negotiate with allied tribal leaders and senior officers to obtain safe passage to leave the country . \n`` We have noticed how many of his henchmen who have defected sought refuge with their tribes or fiefdom , which highlights the importance of tribes in determining Gaddafi 's future . \n`` So he , or his relatives , can tell allied tribes ` I 'll cease the hostility on condition I leave for some country without facing trial .

'' \nA vote in the United Nations Security Council was imminent . \nIt may impose sanctions and say Gaddafi should face war crimes charges over deaths , estimated by diplomats at some 2,000 , during his 10 days of efforts to stem the tide of revolution . \nTalk of possible military action by foreign governments remained vague , however . \nIt was unclear how long Gaddafi , with some thousands of loyalists , some his tribesmen , others military units commanded by his sons , might hold out against rebel forces comprised of youthful gunmen and mutinous soldiers . \nCorrespondents in Tripoli reported occasional gunfire after dark but could not assess the balance of forces in the city . \nLondon-based Algerian lawyer Saad Djebbar , who knows a large number of Gaddafi 's top officials , says that for Gaddafi staying in power had become impossible . \n`` It 's about staying alive . '' '' \n-LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- time is over , '' he added . \n`` But how much damage he will cause before leaving is the question . '' \nOne key element in the opposition 's efforts to unseat him may be tribal loyalties , always a factor in the desert nation of six million and one which Gaddafi , despite official rhetoric to the contrary , tended to reinforce down the years . \nHis former justice minister Mustafa Mohamed Abud Ajleil , now gone over to the opposition in Benghazi , was quoted by the online edition of the Quryna newspaper as saying that an interim government , whose status remained unclear , would `` forgive '' his large Gaddadfa tribe for `` crimes '' committed by the leader . \nSuch declarations may be intended to erode Gaddafi 's efforts to rally supporters into a do-or-die defense of the old guard . \nOne of his sons , the London-educated Saif al-Islam , again appeared on television on Saturday to deny that much of Libya was in revolt . \nBut he also warned : `` What the Libyan nation is going through has opened the door to all options , and now the signs of civil war and foreign interference have started . '' \nGaddafi , once branded a `` mad dog '' by Washington for his support of militant groups worldwide , has been embraced by the West in recent years in return for renouncing some weapons programs and , critically , for opening up Libya 's oilfields . \nWhile money has flowed into Libya , many people , especially in the long-restive and oil-rich east , have seen little benefit and , inspired by the popular overthrow of veteran strongmen in Tunisia and Egypt , on either side of their country , they rose up to demand better conditions and political freedoms last week . \nParticular condemnation has been reserved for aerial bombing by government forces and for reported indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi loyalists and mercenaries on unarmed protesters . \n`` Gaddafi is the enemy of God ! '' \na crowd chanted on Saturday in Tajoura , a poor neighborhood of Tripoli , at the funeral of a man they said was shot down by Gaddafi loyalists the day before . \nNow , residents said , those security forces had disappeared . \nLocals had erected barricades of rocks and palm trees across rubbish-strewn streets , and graffiti covered many walls . \nGaddafi 's forces were nowhere to be seen but bullet holes in the walls of the tightly packed houses bore testimony to violence . \nThe residents , still unwilling to be identified for fear of reprisals , said troops fired on demonstrators who tried to march from Tajoura to central Green Square overnight , killing at least five people . \nThe number could not be independently confirmed . \nA funeral on Saturday morning for one of the victims turned into another show of defiance . \n`` We will demonstrate again and again , today , tomorrow , the day after tomorrow until they change , '' a man who called himself Ali , aged 25 , told Reuters . \nLibyan state television again showed a crowd chanting their loyalty to Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square on Saturday . \nBut journalists estimated their number at scarcely 200 . \nFrom Misrata , a major city 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , residents and exile groups said by telephone that a thrust by forces loyal to Gaddafi , operating from the local airport , had been rebuffed with bloodshed by the opposition . \n`` There were violent clashes last night and in the early hours of the morning near the airport , '' one resident , Mohammed , told Reuters . \n`` An extreme state of alert prevails in the city . '' \nHe said several mercenaries from Chad had been detained by rebels in Misrata . \nThe report could not be verified but was similar to accounts elsewhere of Gaddafi deploying fighters brought in from African states where has long had allies . \nProtesters in Zawiyah , an oil refining town on the main coastal highway 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , have fought off government forces for several nights , according to witnesses who fled across the nearby Tunisian border at Ras Jdir . \nAt Tripoli 's international airport , thousands of desperate foreign workers besieged the main gate trying to leave the country as police used batons and whips to keep them out . \nOutside the main terminal was a sprawling camp of makeshift tents and people huddled together in the cold , wrapped in blankets and surrounded by heaps of clothes , food and garbage . \nBritain and France followed the United States in closing their embassies . \nBritain sent in air force troop carriers to take some 150 oil workers out of camps in the desert . \nLibya supplies 2 percent of the world 's oil , the bulk of it from wells and supply terminals in the east . \nThe prospect of it being shut off -- as well as speculation that the unrest in the Arab world could spread to the major exporters of the Gulf -- has pushed oil prices up to highs not seen in over two years . \nIn recent days , the flamboyant Gaddafi has made several appearances railing against his enemies as rats and cockroaches and blaming the unrest on a range of foes from the United States and Israel to al Qaeda militants and youths high on drugs . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt will be not long now . \nThe only question is will he fall on his sword or be hung high by his people . \nObama SERIOUSLY needs to order a CIA team to pinpoint him and call in a few Cruise Missiles . \nOnly problem is , I do n't thing Obama has even ordered the a @ # $ # ! \ncarrier to the area yet to launch the damn things . -RRB- \n: -LRB- `` The ultimate end of all revolutionary social change is to establish the sanctity of human life .

There has to be reconciliation , '' he said . \nIt is difficult to tell how widespread Farisi 's views are , but his conciliatory tone is echoed by many others in the east including the rebel leadership , whose National Transitional Council on Saturday offered an amnesty to Gaddafi supporters who defect . \nIn Benghazi , the bodies of dead Gaddafi soldiers and those of rebels that fought against them are buried in the same cemetery . \nThey are washed according to Islamic ritual and prayers are said for all , cemetery and morgue workers said . \n`` We do n't have the custom of ` These are Gaddafi 's people , throw them over there ' . \nThey 're all martyrs , and they 're buried together with our martyrs , '' said grave digger Ghaith Hussein . \n`` These people were just following orders ... Our problem is with the one who gave the orders , '' he added . \nHussein and others said those who fought the rebels may have been forced to do so , or could have been fooled by Gaddafi 's propaganda . \nThe Libyan leader 's autocratic rule has been brutal , and deserters risk the death penalty . \nOn state TV , he has labeled the rebels rats and drug-addled followers of al Qaeda . \nAt Benghazi 's courthouse , lawyer Breika Bitamar says she will volunteer to defend captured Gaddafi loyalists for free . \n`` Some of them may genuinely believe the rebels are al Qaeda , or that they are fighting a crusader from abroad in the form of NATO , '' she said . \n`` Some of these men think they are fighting for Libya , and anyone who dies fighting for Libya is a martyr , '' she added . \nHowever , the magnanimity towards Libyan Gaddafi loyalists felt by some in the rebel-held east rarely extends to African mercenaries , who the rebels say Gaddafi has hired to quell the revolt against his four-decade rule . \nAfter battles , rebels often display identity cards taken from the bodies of people from Chad , Niger , Mali , Mauritania and other African states . \nRebels who blame the actions of Gaddafi 's Libyan troops on a misunderstanding are less indulgent with the mercenaries . \nBut morgue worker Haroun Salem , who has handled the bodies of men accused of being mercenaries , bears them no ill will , and has washed their bodies and prayed for them at the cemetery . \n`` Sometimes we find counterfeit or out of date money in their pockets , '' he said . \n`` Gaddafi has tricked them , just like he tricked us for 41 years . \nGod have mercy upon them .

'' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was `` time to stop this unacceptable bloodshed '' in Libya . \nA group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to `` join the people '' and help remove Gaddafi . \nThe justice minister resigned in protest at the `` excessive use of violence '' against protesters and diplomats at Libya 's mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow `` the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi . '' \nBoth Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country ruled by his friend and fellow revolutionary President Hugo Chavez . \nLibyan state television said Gaddafi would give a speech shortly . \nTwo Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta , their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters , Maltese government officials said . \nAn analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the reported air strikes indicated the end was near for Gaddafi . \n`` These really seem to be last , desperate acts . \nIf you 're bombing your own capital , it 's really hard to see how you can survive , '' its Middle East analyst Julien Barnes-Dacey said . \nThe demonstrations spread to Tripoli , on the Mediterranean Sea , after several cities in the east , including Benghazi , appeared to fall to the opposition , according to residents . \nHuman Rights Watch said at least 233 people had been killed in five days of violence , but opposition groups put the figure much higher . \nA coalition of Libyan Muslim leaders told all Muslims it was their duty to rebel against the Libyan leadership because of its `` bloody crimes against humanity . '' \nThe building where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets in Tripoli was on fire on Monday , as was a police station in an eastern suburb , witnesses said . \nAl Jazeera television quoted medical sources as saying 61 people had been killed in the latest protests in Tripoli . \nIt said security forces were looting banks and other government institutions in Tripoli , and protesters had broken into several police stations and ransacked them . \nSaif al-Islam said on Sunday his father would fight the revolt until `` the last man standing . '' \nSome analysts suggested Libya was heading for civil war . \n`` I think what 's going to happen is going to be much more chaotic than what we saw in Egypt or Tunisia . \nGaddafi and his sons do n't have anywhere else to go ... They are going to fight , '' said North Africa analyst Geoff Porter , contributor to political risk consultancy Wikistrat . \nOutput at one of Libya 's oil fields was reported to have been stopped by a workers ' strike and some European oil companies withdrew expatriate workers and suspended operations . \nMost of Libya 's oil fields are in the east , south of Benghazi . \nAnti-government protests have also broken out in the central town of Ras Lanuf , the site of an oil refinery and petrochemical complex , Libya 's Quryna newspaper said on its website on Monday . \nLibyan guards have withdrawn from their side of the border with Egypt and people 's committees were now in control of the crossing , the Egyptian army said , without making if clear if the groups now in control of the border were loyal to Gaddafi . \nGaddafi supporters were in central Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday , waving flags and carrying his portrait , Libyan state TV said . \nThe anger unleashed after four decades of rule by Gaddafi mirrors events in Egypt where a popular revolt overthrew the seemingly impregnable President Hosni Mubarak 10 days ago . \nIn Benghazi , cradle of the uprising , protesters appeared to be largely in control after clashes with troops and police in which dozens of civilians were killed . \nSalahuddin Abdullah , a self-described protest organiser , said : `` In Benghazi there is celebration and euphoria ... The city is no longer under military control . \nIt is completely under demonstrators ' control .

'' \nDozens of people were reported killed in Libya overnight as anti-government protests reached the capital , Tripoli , for the first time . \nSeveral eastern cities appeared to be in opposition hands . \nThe revolt has already cost more than 200 lives . \nSaif al-Islam Gaddafi , one of the mercurial leader 's sons , appeared on state TV overnight , mixing threats with appeals for calm , saying the army would enforce security at any price . \n`` We will keep fighting until the last man standing , even the last woman standing , '' he said , waving a finger at the camera . \nMcCrum said Saif al-Islam 's speech had probably scotched any hopes among young Libyans that he could be a force for reform . \nThe uprising in Libya already looks set to be the bloodiest in a series of popular protests racing across the Middle East from Algeria to Yemen . \nPossibilities for compromise look slim . \n`` Libya is the most likely candidate for civil war because the government has lost control over part of its own territory , '' said Shadi Hamid , of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar . \n`` Benghazi was lost to the opposition and there are reports of other smaller cities going the same way . \nIt is not something the Gaddafi regime is willing to tolerate . '' \nBenghazi , a city in eastern Libya -- the region that is home to most of the country 's oilfields -- is a traditional hotbed of anti-Gaddafi sentiment among tribes hostile to his rule . \nAs the protests have snowballed , Islamic leaders and once-loyal tribes have declared for the opposition . \nSaad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who for years defended Libya in the Lockerbie airline bombing case , said Gaddafi must go . \n`` I 'm sure he has armed to the teeth his own tribesmen and those tribes linked to him . \nI 'm sure he will be also giving them as much cash as possible , '' Djebbar told Reuters . \nHe said Gaddafi had narrowed the circle of his power to his close family and tribe in recent years , alienating allies and tribes who had backed him after he seized power in 1969 . \n`` Gaddafi will go down fighting and Libyans will butcher each other . \nIt 's a fight to the bitter end . \nIf he activates the tribal card , it will only turn Libya into another Somalia . '' \nDjebbar said Western powers should consider protecting any rebel-held areas such as eastern Libya by using air power to bar Gaddafi from bombing his foes into submission -- similar to the no-fly zone they set up in Iraqi Kurdistan after the 1991 Gulf War to deter Saddam Hussein from reasserting control there . \n`` Gaddafi is like a cornered animal -- when threatened he attacks ferociously , '' said McCrum . \n`` Throughout his rule , he has shown no qualms in brutally suppressing any opposition . \n`` He is highly unlikely to make any concessions and if he goes down , he will take as many people with him as possible , '' he added , predicting that events in Libya `` will only get bloodier . '' \nMcCrum said he doubted the army would turn on Gaddafi or emulate the role played by the military in facilitating the departure of long-serving autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia . \n`` The army will not actually effect regime change as in Egypt . \nThey will simply perpetuate the status quo to protect their own interests , '' he said , noting that main arms of the security services were controlled by sons of Gaddafi . \nLibya , once a pariah accused of sponsoring international terrorism , rehabilitated itself by paying compensation to victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other attacks , and by renouncing its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction . \n`` If ever there was a regime which exposes the West 's hypocrisy , Gaddafi 's is it , '' McCrum said . \n`` The West has fallen over itself to rehabilitate Gaddafi so they can get at his oil and now it will pay the price in political capital -- if it has any left . \nIn terms of investment risk , it 's obviously very serious , '' said Julien Barnes-Dace , Middle East analyst at Control Risks . \n`` People are just pulling out . \nEven if Gaddafi survives , there will be huge worries and reputational issues about doing business in Libya . \nLibya would be much more isolated after this . '' \nAnalyst Geoff Porter said Gaddafi had `` nowhere to go , '' unlike ousted Arab leaders such as Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , who found refuge in Saudi Arabia , or Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak , in internal exile in Sharm el-Sheikh . \n`` Possibly the only place he can go is Zimbabwe , '' he said . \n`` So there is no alternative . \n-LRB- If he is toppled -RRB- , he will be like Saddam Hussein and end up hiding in a hole .

We will not leave Libya to the Italians or the Turks . '' \nWagging a finger at the camera , he blamed Libyan exiles for fomenting the violence . \nBut he also promised dialogue on reforms and wage rises . \nA Tripoli resident , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters the streets of the capital were calm early on Monday morning . \nThere was no sign of police , which is unusual for the city . \nHe said that late on Sunday night anti-Gaddafi protesters had been replaced by his supporters , who rallied in the center of the city around Green Square until about 5 a.m. -LRB- 0400 GMT -RRB- . \n`` After Saif al-Islam 's speech , the pro-Gaddafi people , especially the youth , were touring the streets , particularly in the center , cheering Gaddafi . \nThese people stayed up the whole night , they were marching all night , some driving in cars . \n`` They were in Green Square and along Omar al-Mokthar street . \nI would say there were hundreds , '' he said . \n`` I talked to someone near the square where the clashes were taking place and he told me it was quiet and they -LRB- anti-government demonstrators -RRB- have now departed . \n`` Last night during the rioting there were police around and they were shooting into the air . \nBut after that there have been no police around , '' added the Tripoli resident . \nSaif al-Islam 's cajoling may not be enough to douse the anger unleashed after four decades of rule by Gaddafi -- mirroring events in Egypt where a popular revolt overthrew the seemingly impregnable President Hosni Mubarak 10 days ago . \n`` People here in Benghazi are laughing at what he is saying . \nIt is the same old story -LRB- on promised reform -RRB- and nobody believes what he says , '' a lawyer in Libya 's second city told the BBC after watching the speech . \n`` He is liar , liar , 42 years we have heard these lies .

'' \nHe told the TV network that protesters were trying to establish order by creating self-rule committees to run the city and distribute basic foodstuffs . \nEuropean Union foreign ministers will condemn the repression of anti-government protests in Libya at their meeting later on Monday , according to the draft of a joint statement . \nFrance said the international community must do everything it can do prevent Libya sinking into civil war . \nThe United States said it was weighing `` all appropriate actions '' in response to the unrest . \n`` We are analyzing the speech ... to see what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a U.S. official said . \nLibya 's ambassador to India told the BBC he was resigning in protest at the violent crackdown that has killed more than 200 . \nAli al-Essawi also accused the government of deploying foreign mercenaries against the protesters . \nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said that around 3,000 Turkish citizens had applied to be repatriated from Libya since Friday and the first plane was sent to Benghazi on Sunday morning , with more planes to be sent once permission was granted . \nBut CNN Turk reported that one Turkish Airlines plane had returned without landing amid reports that the airport had been taken over by opposition protesters . \nIt was unclear if this plane was the same as the one mentioned by the foreign ministry . \nIn the first sign of serious unrest in the capital , thousands of protesters clashed with Gaddafi supporters . \nGunfire rang out in the night and police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators , some of whom threw stones at Gaddafi billboards . \nSouth Korea said hundreds of Libyans , some armed with knives and guns , attacked a South Korean-run construction site in Tripoli , injuring at least 4 foreign workers . \nHuman Rights Watch said at least 223 people have been killed in five days of violence . \nMost were in Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and a region where Gaddafi 's grip has always been weaker than elsewhere in the oil-rich desert nation . \nHabib al-Obaidi , a surgeon at the Al-Jalae hospital , said the bodies of 50 people , most of them shot , were brought there on Sunday afternoon . \nTwo hundred wounded had arrived , he said . \nMembers of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had brought wounded comrades to the hospital , he said . \nThe soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the protesters and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . \nThe Libyan uprising is one of series of revolts that have raced like wildfire across the Arab world since December , toppling the long-time rulers of Tunisia and Egypt and threatening entrenched dynasties from Bahrain to Yemen . \nThe West has watched with alarm as long-time allies and old foes have come under threat , appealing for reform and urging restraint . \nSupport for Gaddafi , the son of a herdsman who seized power in 1969 , among Libya 's desert tribes was also waning . \nThe leader of the Al-Zuwayya tribe in the east threatened to cut oil exports unless authorities halted `` oppression of protesters '' . \nLibya is Africa 's fourth biggest oil exporter , producing 1.6 million barrels of oil a day . \nOil jumped by more than $ 1 a barrel to $ 103.5 a barrel on fears the unrest could disrupt supplies . \nSome foreign oil companies were withdrawing small numbers of expatriate staff . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara and Christian Lowe ; additional reporting by Brian Love and Daren Butler ; writing by Angus MacSwan ; editing by Giles Elgood -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAn expatriate worker said : `` Some anti-government demonstrators are gathering in the residential complexes . \nThe police are dispersing them . \nI can also see burning cars . '' \nAl Jazeera television said thousands of protesters clashed with supporters of Gaddafi in Tripoli 's Green Square . \nThe violence spread to Tripoli after days of protests in Benghazi , Libya 's second largest city , in which at least 233 people have been killed , according to Human Rights Watch . \nCommunications are tightly controlled and Benghazi is not accessible to international journalists , but the picture that has emerged is of a city slipping from the grasp of security forces in the biggest challenge to Gaddafi 's rule since the `` brotherly leader '' seized power in a 1969 military coup . \nHabib al-Obaidi , head of the intensive care unit at the main Al-Jalae hospital in Benghazi , said the bodies of 50 people , mostly killed by gunshots , had been brought there on Sunday afternoon . \nThe deaths came after scores were killed on Saturday . \nTwo hundred people had arrived wounded , 100 of them in serious condition , he said . \nMembers of an army unit known as the `` Thunderbolt '' squad had come to the hospital carrying wounded comrades , he said . \nThe soldiers said they had defected to the cause of the hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets and had fought and defeated Gaddafi 's elite guards . \n`` They are now saying that they have overpowered the Praetorian Guard and that they have joined the people 's revolt , '' another man at the hospital who heard the soldiers , lawyer Mohamed al-Mana , told Reuters by telephone . \nA Libyan tribal leader threatened to block oil exports to the West within 24 hours if the government does not stop the `` oppression of protesters . '' \nAnother tribal chief told al Jazeera Gaddafi had to leave the country . \nSaif al-Islam , who has in the past pushed a reform agenda in Libya with only limited success , said the protests threatened to sink Libya into civil war and split the country . \nHe said reports of hundreds killed were an exaggeration , but acknowledged the police and army made mistakes in dealing with the protests . \nThe General People 's Congress , Libya 's equivalent of a parliament , would convene on Monday to discuss a `` clear '' reform agenda , while the government would also raise wages , in an apparent attempt to address some of the protesters ' demands , he said . \nThe clamor for reform across a region of huge strategic importance to the West and the source of much of its oil began in Tunisia in December . \nThe overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali then inspired Egyptians to rise up against strongman Hosni Mubarak , overthrowing him on February 11 . \nThe tide has challenged Arab leaders , including many who have long been backed by the West as vital energy suppliers and enemies of Islamist militants . \nWhile each uprising has its own dynamics , from religion to tribalism , all protesters seem united by frustration over economic hardship and a lack of political freedom under entrenched elites . \nUnrest also hit Yemen , Tunisia , Morocco , Oman , Kuwait , Algeria and Djibouti over the weekend as people took to the streets demanding political and economic change . \nIn Iran , thousands of security personnel deployed in the streets of Tehran and other cities to prevent protesters rallying in spite of a ban , opposition websites said . \nThe United States said it was `` gravely concerned '' by the situation in Libya and warned its citizens to delay trips there . \nIn Bahrain , the main opposition party said it wanted the crown prince to show signs of addressing opposition demands before any formal dialogue could start . \nCrown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa , of the ruling Sunni Muslim dynasty , made conciliatory moves after days of violence in which at least six people died . \n`` All political parties in the country deserve a voice at the table , '' he told CNN . \n`` I think there is a lot of anger , a lot of sadness ... We are terribly sorry and this is a terrible tragedy for our nation , '' said the prince , who is seen as a reformist . \nIbrahim Mattar , a lawmaker of the main opposition Wefaq party , said protesters , thousands of whom were camping out in Pearl square , wanted more than words . \n`` We are waiting for an initiative from him , with a scope for dialogue , '' he said , adding that the prince should `` send a small signal he is willing to have a constitutional monarchy .

'' \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was `` time to stop this unnacceptable bloodshed '' in Libya . \nA group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to `` join the people '' and help remove Gaddafi . \nThe justice minister resigned in protest at the `` excessive use of violence '' against protesters and diplomats at Libya 's mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow `` the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi . '' \nBoth Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country ruled by his friend and fellow revolutionary President Hugo Chavez . \nLibyan state television said Gaddafi would give a speech shortly . \nTwo Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta , their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters , Maltese government officials said . \nAn analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the reported air strikes indicated the end was near for Gaddafi . \n`` These really seem to be last , desperate acts . \nIf you 're bombing your own capital , it 's really hard to see how you can survive , '' its Middle East analyst Julien Barnes-Dacey said . \nThe demonstrations spread to Tripoli , on the Mediterranean Sea , after several cities in the east , including Benghazi , appeared to fall to the opposition , according to residents . \nHuman Rights Watch said at least 233 people had been killed in five days of violence , but opposition groups put the figure much higher . \nA coalition of Libyan Muslim leaders told all Muslims it was their duty to rebel against the Libyan leadership because of its `` bloody crimes against humanity . '' \nThe building where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets in Tripoli was on fire on Monday , as was a police station in an eastern suburb , witnesses said . \nAl Jazeera television quoted medical sources as saying 61 people had been killed in the latest protests in Tripoli . \nIt said security forces were looting banks and other government institutions in Tripoli , and protesters had broken into several police stations and ransacked them . \nSaif al-Islam said on Sunday his father would fight the revolt until `` the last man standing . '' \nSome analysts suggested Libya was heading for civil war . \n`` I think what 's going to happen is going to be much more chaotic than what we saw in Egypt or Tunisia . \nGaddafi and his sons do n't have anywhere else to go ...

Libyan troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fought gun battles with rebels in the town of Zawiyah Saturday , witnesses said , shutting the coastal highway that links the capital Tripoli with Tunisia . \nTwo Reuters reporters traveling via the town , which lies just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- outside of Tripoli , on two separate trips six hours apart , were diverted via backstreets with a police escort while the fighting raged on . \nThey said the highway was deserted except for lots of soldiers , police and armed men in civilian clothes . \nOne heard bursts of gunfire coming from the direction of the city . \n`` The situation is very bad in Zawiyah . \nThere 's been fierce fighting since the morning , '' said the resident , who gave only his first name , Mohammed , fearing reprisals . \nFour months since Gaddafi 's forces crushed a popular uprising against his four-decade rule that then morphed into an armed rebellion , Libya 's civil war is in stalemate . \nNearly three months of bombings by NATO war planes against Libyan military targets have failed to unseat Gaddafi or enable the rebels to launch an offensive on his territory in Tripoli . \nSeveral explosions were heard in Tripoli throughout the afternoon , as late as 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , suggesting NATO was ramping up attacks after a quiet morning . \nLibya TV reported that `` the imperialist aggressors '' had bombed several sites in and around the Libyan capital , in the town of Yafran , then showed footage of what it said were children wounded in past NATO bombings , to violin music . \nRebel spokesman Ahmed Bani said a senior Gaddafi aide had been wounded in a NATO strike on a city close to Tripoli on Saturday evening and was in hospital . \nThere was no independent confirmation and Libyan officials were not available to comment . \nThe rebels control the east of Libya , the western city of Misrata and the range of mountains near the border with Tunisia . \nThey are seeking to encircle the capital and cut it off , an aim that would be advanced if they manage to capture Zawiyah . \nThe highway has been used throughout the conflict by Gaddafi 's officials -- including fleeing defectors -- to reach the outside world , and by trucks bringing in food and other supplies to territory under Gaddafi 's control . \nAfter a lull in fighting in the western , rebel-held city of Misrata , pro-Gaddafi forces which have besieging it started shelling its port late Saturday , Al Jazeera TV reported . \nA doctor at the Hekma hospital said 31 people were killed and 110 wounded in shelling by Gaddafi forces Friday . \nPro-Gaddafi troops encircled the city of Zlitan , 160 km east of Tripoli , Saturday , rebels said , after fighting broke out there that could also open up the coastal road to the capital . \nSome clashes between Gaddafi 's forces and rebels continued in the city , rebel spokesman Bani said , after the rebels took some parts of it . \nThe toll remained 22 rebels killed . \nGovernment spokesman Moussa Ibrahim played down the clashes . \n`` There is no serious fighting going on in Zawiya or Zlitan . \nWhat has happened is that we 've had small groups of rebels who have made their way from Zintan and the Western Mountains to cause trouble in these areas , '' he told Reuters . \nZlitan is one of three towns that are largely government controlled between the rebel-held Misrata and the capital . \nWere it to fall , it could allow the anti-Gaddafi uprising to spread from Misrata , the biggest rebel outpost in western Libya , to Gaddafi 's stronghold in Tripoli . \nWorld powers have given mixed signals on how the war might play out , with Russia trying to mediate reconciliation . \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Friday he had offered a `` guarantee '' to Gaddafi if he left Libya , but received no reply . \nGaddafi has refused to step down , describing the rebels as al Qaeda terrorists and Western intervention as an oil grab . \nAs diplomacy falters , several new battle fronts have opened . \nGaddafi 's forces also shelled for the first time the UNESCO world heritage-listed city of Ghadames , 600 km -LRB- 370 miles -RRB- southwest of Tripoli , on the Tunisia and Algeria borders , overnight , opening a new front in the war , rebels said . \nRebels said the oasis town , with a population of about 7,000 people , mainly Berber , was under attack after an anti-government protest in the old Roman city Wednesday . \n`` This is a retaliation for anti-regime protests , '' spokesman Juma Ibrahim said from the rebel-held town of Zintan . \nThe report could not be independently verified . \nThe old town was de-populated by Gaddafi in the 1990s and its inhabitants moved into modern buildings . \nIt was not clear if the attack hit the old town , a labyrinth of narrow , underground passages and houses known as the `` Pearl of the Desert . '' \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Friday some NATO allies of failing to pull their weight : `` The mightiest military alliance in history was only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , '' he said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWhy would they want to protect this guy ? \nBrazilian1 : by offering Gaddafi a way for him and his family to get out of Libya and live comfortably in Turkey , they hope to end the war immediately . \nBut after what happened in Egypt , it is much less likely that Gaddafi or any other dictator will take such a deal . \nRemember , Gaddafi only lives acts to benefit himself and his friends . \nLibya is just his piggy bank . \nDo n't get me wrong , I believe in what NATO is doing to remove Gaddafi from power . \nCa n't someone explain to me a NATO statement that the Gaddafi 's side is running out of supplies -LRB- Food , Fuel , and medicine -RRB- and it should only be a matter of weeks until they have no more . \nThen I read this artical above and it has this statement ; `` The highway has been used throughout the four-month-old conflict by Gaddafi 's officials -- including fleeing defectors -- to reach the outside world , and by trucks bringing in food and other supplies to territory under Gaddafi 's control '' . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "293", "time": "2011-05-13", "text": "UNITED NATIONS | Fri May 13 , 2011 6:04 pm EDT UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Recent U.N. resolutions on Libya broke new ground in backing international action to protect civilians , but the stalemated civil war that has ensued could roll back those advances , diplomats and analysts say . \nRussia , China and other powers have voiced dismay that the world body has appeared to take sides in an internal conflict , not just in Libya but also in Ivory Coast , where a Security Council resolution led to the ousting of an incumbent ruler . \nAs a result , veto-holders Russia and China may not be as willing in future to permit sweeping endorsements for tough action , either by a coalition -- as in Libya -- or by U.N. peacekeepers -- as in Ivory Coast , diplomats say . \nNo one contests the principle of protecting civilians during armed conflict , a theme that has been on the Security Council agenda for more than a decade . \nThe skeptics ' concern is that it will be used as a cover by Western powers bent on overthrowing leaders they do not like . \nMore generally , it raises the specter of `` interference in the internal affairs '' of sovereign states , a taboo for Moscow and Beijing for decades . \nIn Libya , a March 17 Security Council resolution authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians as Tripoli looked set to crush rebels who had seized control of the east . \nWestern air and missile strikes on the forces of leader Muammar Gaddafi drove them back from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nIt was the first time the Council had authorized a military response to protect populations in a non-consenting state . \nIn Ivory Coast , a similarly worded resolution passed on March 30 resulted in military action by French and U.N. peacekeepers that culminated 12 days later in the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo , who had refused to cede power after a presidential election the United Nations said he lost . \nAs a consequence , Gbagbo 's challenger , Alassane Ouattara , took over the West African country . \nFollowing the two resolutions , human rights groups were ecstatic over what they saw as a new willingness by the United Nations to enforce principles to which it had long paid lip service . \nRussia and China , faced with an Arab League call for U.N. action on Libya and West African support over Ivory Coast , had abstained in the first resolution and voted for the second . \nBut both soon made clear they thought the United Nations was at risk of overstepping its authority -- not protecting civilians but backing one faction in a civil conflict . \nAt a Security Council debate this week , Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said it was `` unacceptable for U.N. peacekeepers ... to be drawn into armed conflict and essentially to take the side of one of the parties . '' \nChinese Ambassador Li Baodong said , `` There must be no attempt at regime change or involvement in a civil war of a country by any party in the name of protecting civilians . '' \nSimilar concerns have been expressed by Brazil , India and South Africa , which are also on the Security Council . \nThe implications have not been lost on Western diplomats who had hoped the Council 's adoption of the Libya and Ivory Coast resolutions might set a precedent . \n`` There was a chance to create a model for the protection of civilians in Libya . \nBut now it 's going to be very difficult in the future to persuade Russia and China to support such operations , '' a diplomat said . \nAn immediate casualty could be a Western attempt to bring about Security Council action on Syria 's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters . \n`` Some people are cautious in the context of Libya , '' a diplomat commented . \nProtection of civilians is written into the mandate of at least seven U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world and has been the subject of regular reports by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor , Kofi Annan . \nThese , however , have tended to focus on the soft end of the subject , such as programs to train peacekeepers , rather than the sharp end of NATO bombing a government army , as in Libya . \nThe subject also has become enmeshed with an arcane debate at the United Nations over whether the world body has a `` responsibility to protect '' -- or R2P in U.N. jargon -- populations threatened by genocide or other mass atrocities . \nThat concept was launched in a 2005 summit of more than 150 world leaders in a belated response to a perceived U.N. failure to prevent massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s . \nA carefully crafted declaration said the responsibility began with the government of the country concerned . \nIf that failed , it foresaw a sliding scale of international action ranging from advice through mediation to -- in a last resort -- intervention by force authorized by the Security Council . \nA General Assembly conference two years ago showed that most U.N. members broadly supported R2P , but envoys from leftist states in Latin America and elsewhere denounced it as a smokescreen for `` colonialism and interventionism '' by the West . \nSome diplomats say that if the Libyan insurrection had toppled Gaddafi in a couple of weeks , rather than extending into a drawn-out civil war , concerns about how protection of civilians was to be interpreted would have been far fewer . \nSupporters of R2P say that was never likely to happen and it was too soon to say the concept was fatally damaged . \nBut Ramesh Thakur of the Australian National University said , `` The evolution of R2P , and prospects of its being authorized\\/used again , will depend on how Libya turns out . \nIf NATO respects its limitations and success is achieved , R2P stands vindicated . \nIf -LRB- resolution -RRB- 1973 -LRB- on Libya -RRB- is abused and a messy stalemate ensues , the bar will be greatly raised . '' \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nDid not NATO kill innocent citizens in trying to dislodge Gaddafi ? \nThen what about Syria ? \nLook at the mass killing going on there , why is not the UN doing more than they did in Libya ? \nThis is very immoral and wicked of us to behave like this over Libya . \nThere has to be a hidden agenda on Libya , and I think we all know it ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Our flags are flying there , '' Ahmed Bani , a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , told a news conference in Tripoli . \nIt was not possible to obtain independent confirmation . \nSabha , 770 km -LRB- 480 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli and overlooked by an old fort built by Libya 's former Italian colonial rulers , controls the main trail south to neighboring Niger , an escape route used by members of Gaddafi 's entourage . \nAny advance on the town , which is still used as a military base , would be an important boost for government forces who are struggling to oust Gaddafi loyalists from the towns of Bani Walid and Sirte as well as to contain disunity in their ranks . \nBani also denied an assertion by Gaddafi 's spokesman that his forces had captured 17 British and French nationals in the fight for Bani Walid . \n`` There are no British or French prisoners '' in the town , Bani said . \nThe claim by Gaddafi 's spokesman Moussa Ibrahim that foreign security personnel had been captured could not be verified and no immediate proof was presented . \n`` A group was captured in Bani Walid consisting of 17 mercenaries . \nThey are technical experts and they include consultative officers , '' Gaddafi spokesman Ibrahim said on Syria-based Arrai television , which has backed Gaddafi . \n`` Most of them are French , one of them is from an Asian country that has not been identified , two English people and one Qatari . '' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there were `` no French mercenaries in Libya , '' while the British foreign office said it had no information about whether the report was true . \nQatar 's foreign ministry was not available for comment . \nNATO , which is staging air strikes on Gaddafi loyalist positions , says it has no troops on the ground in Libya . \nWestern nations have sent special forces in the past , and media have reported that private security firms have aided anti-Gaddafi forces in training , target ting and with leadership . \nGulf Arab states have also sent trainers and arms . \nAmong the confirmed sightings of foreign security personnel in Libya during the conflict , the head of a French security firm was shot dead at a checkpoint in Benghazi in May , and British special forces troops were held for three days by rebels in March while escorting a spy trying to make contacts . \nThe claim about the capture of foreign security personnel added to confusion about the situation in Libya nearly a month after Gaddafi was driven from power . \nThe former leader 's loyalist holdouts have beaten back repeated assaults by National Transitional Council forces at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home city of Sirte . \nNTC fighters have been sent fleeing in disarray after failing to storm Gaddafi bastions . \nThe NTC , still based in the eastern city of Benghazi , has faced questions about whether it can unify a country divided on tribal and local lines . \nA long-promised attempt to set up a more inclusive interim government fell apart overnight . \nOn Monday , NTC forces were unable to approach the northern gate of Bani Walid , 150 km -LRB- 95 miles -RRB- southeast of Tripoli , to attack the town because of heavy gunfire from Gaddafi loyalists . \n`` There is a lack of organization so far . \nInfantrymen are running in all directions , '' said Zakaria Tuham , a senior fighter with a Tripoli-based unit . \nMany fighters spoke of tension between units drawn from Bani Walid itself and those from other parts of the country . \nSome fighters openly disobeyed orders . \nIn one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop shooting in the air . \nNTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace , where assaults have been repelled . \nHundreds of families were fleeing the city on Monday as NTC forces rolled up with huge rocket launchers and artillery . \nHumanitarian groups have voiced alarm at reported conditions in the besieged coastal city . \n`` There 's no electricity , no phone coverage . \nNothing , '' resident Ibrahim Ramadan said , standing by a car packed with his family at a checkpoint . \nInterim government forces were handing out juice to civilians and rifling through their belongings to search for weapons . \nResidents said homes had been destroyed and cars smashed to pieces as disorder spread through the city . \n`` People are fed up . \nThere are explosions going off everywhere and you do n't know where the bullets will come from next , '' said Abubakr , a resident making his way out of the city . \n`` Look at this , '' he said , pointing to a bullet hole in his windshield . \n`` Bullets are coming down from above . \nPeople are just firing randomly . '' \nIn Benghazi , interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril failed to name a new cabinet on Sunday when his proposals did not receive full backing from all current members . \n`` We have agreed on a number of portfolios . \nWe still have more portfolios to be discussed , '' Jibril told reporters at a news conference on Sunday . \nSources familiar with the negotiations said Jibril 's own role had been a sticking point . \nThere was also disagreement about whether it was right to form a transitional government before declaring Libya `` liberated , '' which NTC officials say can only happen when all Gaddafi loyalists are defeated . \nThe political infighting reveals some of the fractures in an alliance that was united in civil war by hatred of Gaddafi but remains split among pro-Western liberals , underground Islamist guerrillas and defectors from Gaddafi 's government . \nThe NTC has its roots in Libya 's east , but most of the militiamen who finally succeeded in driving Gaddafi out of Tripoli are from towns in the west . \nFighters are organized by home town into units with little overall coordination . \nNevertheless , many Libyans say they can tolerate confusion among the new rulers as the price of being rid of Gaddafi , who crushed all opposition during four decades of rule . \n`` The delay in the new government is n't important ...

Security Council eases sanctions on Libya UNITED NATIONS | Sat Sep 17 , 2011 8:24 am IST UNITED NATIONS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.N. Security Council on Friday eased sanctions on Libya , including on its national oil company and central bank , to enable key institutions to recover after rebels won a civil war . \nThe 15-nation council voted unanimously for a resolution that also establishes a U.N. mission in Libya to help the North African nation get back on its feet after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi . \nThe resolution begins lifting punitive measures imposed on the oil-exporting country six months ago when Gaddafi was overseeing a crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators . \nDespite arguments among council members since then over the application of previous resolutions , especially NATO 's bombing of Gaddafi 's forces , the council came together after Libya 's former rebels established control over most of the country . \nIn Friday 's resolution , the council declared `` its determination to ensure that assets frozen pursuant to -LRB- U.N. sanctions resolutions -RRB- shall as soon as possible be made available to and for the benefit of the people of Libya . '' \nEarlier on Friday , the U.N. General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country 's interim government as Tripoli 's sole representatives at the world body , effectively recognizing the National Transitional Council . \nBoth actions `` make clear the international community 's determination to support the new Libyan authorities , and the Libyan people , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . \nThe Security Council resolution lifts all sanctions against the Libyan National Oil Corp and Zueitina Oil Co as part of what British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said was an effort to `` help kick-start Libya 's economy and encourage economic self-sufficiency . '' \nThe British-drafted text also partly eases sanctions on the central bank and other Libyan institutions , although special approval by the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee will still be needed to unfreeze their seized assets . \nThe committee has already authorized the emergency unfreezing of some $ 16 billion of Libyan assets , held mainly by Western countries , Security Council diplomats say . \nBut some measures are being kept `` to ensure that previously frozen funds are released in a transparent and responsible way as the situation normalizes and the transition proceeds , '' U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told the council . \nDiplomats said one problem with immediately unfreezing all assets was confusion in some cases about exactly who would be able to benefit from them . \nAn arms embargo will remain in place , but Libya 's interim government and the United Nations will be allowed to import light weapons to maintain security . \nThe resolution establishes a U.N. mission in Libya , which diplomats say will consist of up to 200 people in an initial three-month phase to help the government with a post-conflict transition . \nTheir tasks are expected to include police training and electoral assistance , U.N. officials say . \nThe resolution does not call , however , for the deployment of peacekeepers or police as part of the new U.N. Support Mission in Libya . \nNor does it call for an end to the no-fly zone a March resolution imposed over the country , although diplomats say Libyan civil airliners will be allowed to fly provided they notify monitors of their flight plans . \nRussian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin , a prominent critic of NATO 's air campaign in Libya , called for the prompt lifting of the no-fly-zone and also voiced concerns about human rights violations in Libya . \n`` It 's becoming increasingly clear that crimes were being committed by all parties to the conflict , '' he said . \nThe National Transitional Council was represented at the Security Council meeting by Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy U.N. ambassador whose defection to the rebels in February inspired dozens of his country 's diplomats worldwide to denounce Gaddafi . \n`` A period of terror , of denial of freedom and violation of human rights has now come to an end for the Libyan people , '' Dabbashi told the council . \nHe said Libya was the first instance of the much-quoted but seldom-applied U.N. `` responsibility to protect '' principle , `` which was done in a reasonable manner , which saved the lives of thousands of Libyans and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Libya .

{"id": "246", "time": "2011-09-28", "text": "LONDON | Wed Sep 28 , 2011 10:58 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As Syrian army defectors begin launching attacks on government forces , Syria 's largely peaceful rebellion appears in danger of descending into a sectarian civil war with wider regional consequences . \nForces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday attempted to wrest control of a central town from military forces that had gone over to the opposition , whilst in other towns there were also reports of fighters coming together . \nDetails were far from clear and diplomats and other sources said defecting units appeared a `` hodgepodge '' who might struggle to mount a sustained fight against superior forces . \nProtesters have occasionally seized weapons to attack security forces , but witnesses say protests have been generally peaceful . \nThe appearance of loosely organized groups of military deserters lends a new dimension to the uprising . \n`` The strategy of peaceful opposition is clearly losing ground in the face of Assad 's brutal counter response and the call to arms is gaining currency as the only way of dislodging the regime , '' said Julien Barnes-Dacey , Middle East analyst at London-based consultancy Control Risks . \n`` The key question is whether or not this will spread and result in a more decisive break right across the military . '' \nMost believe that is unlikely . \nSyria 's military has long been divided along sectarian lines and most expect that the units most dedicated to Assad -- made up largely of Alawites who are an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam -- will remain loyal . \nThat could leave neither side with the strength to win and open the door to months or years of war . \nThe risk , experts say , is that neither side feels they can back down with the opposition fearing they will be hunted down and killed if Assad can reassert control whilst Alawites and other allied groups fear reprisals if he goes . \nWhilst some in Syria 's somewhat unsupported opposition may have ambitions of repeating the success of their counterparts in Libya in ultimately marching on the capital and taking power , few analysts believe that a plausible imminent outcome . \n`` The regime will most likely use this to in order to justify and further intensify its bloody crackdown , '' says Anthony Skinner , Middle East and North Africa director at political risk consultancy Maplecroft . \n`` This increases the risk of Syria sliding into a civil war . '' \nSome worry about a further regionalization of the conflict . \nIn Bahrain , largely Sunni Gulf states backed the monarchy as it crushed unrest from primarily Shi'ite demonstrators demanding equal rights in jobs and public services . \nThat raised hackles on both sides of the Middle East 's sectarian divide that could worsen further if largely Shi'ite Iran ramps up support for its long-time ally Assad and Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia move closer to backing the opposition . \n`` This has a lot of worrying regional implications , particularly if it leads to Syria moving toward becoming a failed state , '' said Stephen Heydemann , a senior vice president and regional specialist at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington . \n`` There 's a risk it could exacerbate regional tensions that have already been made worse by Bahrain . '' \nSectarian fighting in Syria could also raise tensions between assorted other smaller cross-border groupings in neighboring countries including Alawites and Kurds in Turkey and Shi'ites and Sunnis in Lebanon . \nFor now , analysts say it is still too soon to say whether enough soldiers will defect to form a force that could be a significant military threat to the Damascus government . \n`` The rate of defections is increasing , '' says Alan Fraser , Middle East analyst for London-based risk consultancy AKE . \n`` However ... it is coming amid a fall in the number of protests throughout the country -- which are slowly losing momentum amid the ongoing crackdown . \nIt will take significantly greater numbers of defectors to significantly threaten the regime . '' \nNor is it yet clear to what extent the wider , somewhat disparate opposition movement wants to embrace a more violent approach . \nThe Syrian National Council , a unified opposition formed this month to support the uprising , and the Local Coordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- , the grassroots activist network that has powered the rolling demonstrations across Syria over the past six months , are explicitly against recourse to violence . \n`` It is not a countrywide trend , '' said Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group . \n`` In parts of the country people have been preparing themselves ... but continue showing restraint . \nIn others , they simply can not afford weapons . '' \nIn the longer run , some analysts say the opposition 's best hope is to try to hang on in the hope that ever tightening sanctions take their toll on Assad 's rule . \nSanctions will likely starve his government of the oil sales that make up some 30 percent of government revenue , whilst much of the wider economy is also now effectively moribund or shut down . \n`` The Libya option is n't there , particularly because the Europeans and other regional powers are n't willing to play the role they played in Libya , '' said Jon Alterman , Middle East program director of the Center for Security and International Studies in Washington DC . \n`` There might be the option of some kind of covert operations support for the opposition but it 's hard to see what the point or strategy might be . '' \nMany outside groups working with Syria 's protesters have long tried to persuade them that taking up arms is the wrong way of pursuing their struggle , encouraging them instead to pursue non-violent methods such as boycotts and strikes . \n`` Any violence committed by opposition forces will harm the movement , '' said Srdja Popovic , a Serbian activist involved in the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2001 and who now works with dissident groups worldwide including the Syrians . \n`` It will also diminish the possibility of achieving unity within the Syrian people and building a realistic alternative . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nJust like in Egypt , Libya and Tunis , this uprising is to get rid of the brutal police state and implement a free democracy . \nThis regime has a record of extreme brutality when dealing with anyone with an opinion , and people are sick of that and want change . \nSectarianism has plays a very small role in this popular uprising . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe justice minister of Niger said Gaddafi 's son Saadi had been intercepted in a convoy after crossing the frontier , heading in the direction of the oasis town of Agadez . \nTwo of Gaddafi 's other sons , Mohamed and Hannibal , and his only daughter Aisha have already obtained shelter in Algeria . \nThree sons remain at large -- Mutassim and Khamis who both run elite military units , and Saif al-Islam , Gaddafi 's one-time heir apparent who like his father is wanted for war crimes by the international court in the Hague . \nOne son , Saif al-Arab , was reported killed during the war . \nAsked what Saadi Gaddafi 's status in the country was , Niger Justice Minister Marou Adamou said only that Niger would fulfill its humanitarian obligations . \nWashington and others have put pressure on neighboring states not to shelter Gaddafi or officials who are wanted for crimes . \nThe NTC , based for months in the eastern city of Benghazi , faces the difficult task of winning the support of all Libyans , including fighters from towns and cities in the west who did the bulk of the fighting in the rapid advance on Tripoli . \nThe interim government also has to deliver on promises to quickly restart an economy frozen by international sanctions , the halt in oil production and an exodus of foreign worker . \nInterim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril announced the NTC would form a more inclusive interim government within 10 days . \nHe said it had started to produce some oil on Saturday , but gave no details of where or how much . \nInside the capital , Reuters reporters saw Bouzaid Dorda , a former prime minister who ran Gaddafi 's external spy service , held by a group of about 20 fighters under guard in a house in the capital 's Zenata district . \nA fighter said he would be handed over to the interim authorities later on Sunday . \nA tall , lanky figure in safari jacket and slip-on shoes , Dorda was sitting on a sofa and was not physically restrained but an armed guard sat beside him . \nHe declined a request for an interview , but in response to an assertion by a fighter that he had killed people , he replied : `` Prove it . '' \n`` I am innocent until proven guilty . \nI am willing to be referred to the Libyan prosecutor general , '' he said . \nVisibly agitated , he added : `` You have to remember it was a regime already in existence . '' \nBani Walid resident Khalifa Telisi , who had telephoned a family inside the town , said fighting was concentrated around the central market area , where Gaddafi forces were based . \n`` There is still resistance from the central market . \nAll other parts of Bani Walid have been liberated , '' Telisi said . \nInside the town , a pro-Gaddafi local radio station appealed for the city 's 100,000 people to fight to the death . \n`` We urge the people of Bani Walid to defend the city against the rats and armed gangs . \nDo n't back down . \nFight to the death . \nWe are waiting for you . \nYou are just a bunch of gangsters . \nGod is on our side , '' an announcer said . \nThe language echoed turns of phrase used by Gaddafi in recent broadcasts . \nGaddafi 's loyalists also control Sirte , which sits on the main east-west coastal highway , effectively cutting Libya in two . \nAdvancing NTC troops said the front line was now about 90 km east of the city . \nFighters were firing tanks and howitzers amid the sound of heavy machinegun fire and the roar of NATO warplanes overhead . \n`` There were clashes this morning and Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets , but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon , '' fighter Salah al-Shaery said . \nThe United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside the besieged pro-Gaddafi bastions . \n`` Our big concern right now is Sirte , where we are receiving reports that there 's no water and no electricity , '' U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in an interview . \nShe said the world body was also worried about the fate of sub-Saharan African migrants , who face revenge attacks as suspected mercenaries even though most are ordinary laborers . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe only hope for the rag-tag rebels is for their masters in the UN\\/NATO to apply their brutal scotch earth policy to bombard Qaddafi supporters and reduce entire cities to rubble . \nNATO do not really care about the tribes that want sovereignty , they need 100 % puppets . \nThe rag-tags too are heartless , greedy and hungry to loot and revenge . \nNATO is itching for the oil\\/gas wealth and are already squabbling about contracts . \nMore greed and exploitation will show soon and all Libyans will realize what is in store with the kind of NATO regime they are tying to put in place-led by the NTC proxy group . \nThe whole war fiasco was imposed on Libyans , the rebels are unpopular , backward and racists eliminating dark skinned people , the UN is just a club for the west or in the pockets of the west . \nUN means very little to the rest of the world in the current state of the world . \nWhy is the U.S. helping to overthrow Ghadaffi ? \nHe was doing a fine job of keeping his muslims in check . \nWhen he is gone , we will probably see another chaos-causing islamic state similar to Iran . \nMilitary wing of Libyan `` rebel '' movement has strong links to Al Qaeda . \nThis wing already assassinated the more moderate civilian-minded rebel commander -LRB- Younis -RRB- . \nAfter 9\\/11 Gaddafy collaborated with CIA and British intelligence to interrogate\\/torture Libyan Al Qaeda suspects . \nThese same former suspects helped overthrow Gaddafy and are now in charge of Tripoli militias and gangs . \nAssuming they are not totally innocent of those Al Qaeda suspicions , then they will likely try to use Libya as new Al Qaeda base , like Afghanistan used to be , armed with all the weapons they took as trophies from Gaddafy-regime army . \nFrom this base they could launch attacks on other Middle East countries , as well as Europe and USA . \nA fine pickle it could turn out to be . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe derogatory graffiti covering Tawargha 's walls makes it clear where many local fighters stand on the question of return . \n`` Tawargha , you dogs , 3,000 km this way , '' reads one message spray-painted on a road sign , beside an arrow pointing south into the Sahara desert . \n`` Formerly Tawargha , '' says another . \nMany of Tawargha 's erstwhile residents say they see little hope of returning home , partly because their dark skin makes them obvious targets for vengeful fighters in the area . \n`` It 's about the color of the skin . \nThat 's why they have problems with Tawargha , '' Samia Taher , a light-skinned Libyan woman born in Illinois who married into a Tawargha family , said as she rested near the mosque where families sheltered , a couple of km -LRB- miles -RRB- from the heart of Sirte , besieged by NTC forces . \nShe was interrupted by a burst of tank fire from a nearby hill . \nWomen in brightly-coloured headscarves gasped and children flinched as the boom echoed through the lot , where mattresses and blankets were piled up and men rested in the shade . \n`` I just want to get the family out of here . \nWe 're in the middle of a battle here in Sirte , '' Taher , speaking in American-accented English , said of the struggle for Gaddafi 's birthplace . \nMany NTC fighters deny their feud with Tawargha is about race . \nBut they are openly hostile toward the town , which they say supported Gaddafi in return for money and services . \nEven before the war , Misrata residents disparaged Tawargha , calling its young people criminals and drug addicts , or accusing its menfolk of marrying often and working little . \nScorn turned to outright hostility after Gaddafi 's forces assaulted Misrata with rockets , snipers and artillery to try to quash the uprising there in February , using Tawargha as a staging ground for a siege that killed more than 1,000 people . \nWith the help of NATO air strikes , anti-Gaddafi rebels were able to break the siege and take control of Tawargha . \nThe charred husks of tanks , unexploded rockets and bullet casings on the outskirts of the town testify to the battle 's ferocity . \nMany in Misrata accuse men from Tawargha of looting homes and raping women in Misrata during the siege , claims that are impossible to confirm , but display the depth of their enmity . \nAs evidence , one resident offered a cell phone video he said was found on a slain Gaddafi soldier . \nIt showed scores of black men in green military jackets with assault rifles marching down a tree-lined road he said led from Tawargha to Misrata . \nTawarghy and other residents admit that support for Gaddafi ran strong in their town , but are quick to add that this does not justify demonising and punishing an entire community . \nSome of those who have taken refuge in cities along the Mediterranean coast say their homes in Tawargha have been burned and that relatives or neighbors have been abducted or attacked . \nThe group of about 135 sheltering near Sirte ricocheted for months from town to town in search of a haven , only to end up in the crossfire of one of the civil war 's last battles . \n`` It 's all very tragic . \nWe lack security and safety , and we have to worry about food , '' Tawarghy -- the name he gave meaning one from Tawargha -- said . \n`` All this and you 're calling for freedom ? \nWhat kind of freedom are you seeking ? '' \nGallal , the NTC spokesman , said he expected residents who had not committed crimes to return to their homes eventually . \n`` The other solution would be mass relocation of people . \nThat 's hardly an ideal solution . \nThings are tense at the moment , but I think in time they will fall into place , '' he said . \nAny such restitution is sure to be complicated . \nMuch of Tawargha is in ruins . \nThe charred skeletons of cars , busted electronics and garbage cover the streets between bullet-scarred apartment blocks . \nGoats and camels wander amid the wreckage . \nGreen flags , a symbol of support for Gaddafi , still flutter over many buildings , more than a month after the deposed leader 's forces were pushed out of the capital , Tripoli . \nDespite NTC assurances , many in Misrata say it would only lead to more violence if Tawargha 's residents were allowed to return , even if some were innocent . \nThe crimes against Misrata were just too many and too heinous , they say . \n`` To avoid the recurrence of any future problems , we should separate the two groups , '' said a Misrata man named Saleh as he stood near a Tawargha apartment block being used as temporary shelter for non-Tawargha families fleeing fighting in Sirte . \n`` They should be compensated for their land and houses , and they should find a new area to live elsewhere .

{"id": "71", "time": "2011-09-27", "text": "The views expressed are his own . \nIn a trip to Libya this month , just weeks after Muammar Qaddafi s fall , I found peace coming fast to Tripoli , despite continued resistance in several Libyan towns . \nTen days ago , families with children mobbed Martyrs square , where Qaddafi once held forth , to commemorate the hanging 80 years ago of Libya s hero of resistance against the Italians , Omar Mukhtar . \nElementary schools opened last week . \nThe university will open next month . \nWater and electricity are flowing . \nUniformed police are on the street . \nTrash collection is haphazard but functioning . \nThis is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed : faster than Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq or Afghanistan . \nCertainly faster than Somalia , Sierra Leone or Rwanda . \nWhy this rapid recovery in a country marked by four decades of dictatorship ? \nWhy does Libya seem on track while Egypt seems to have gone off the rails ? \nLibya has at least three important advantages : good leadership and clear goals at the national and local levels , careful planning and adequate resources . \nLibyans believe Mustafa Abdel Jalil , who leads the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , is uncorrupted and uninterested in continuing in power . \nHe has pledged not to seek future office . \nHe has visited the liberated cities to celebrate the single goal of freeing Libya from the Qaddafi regime . \nThe NTC has replaced Qaddafi s green flag with the red , black and green banner emblazoned with the star and crescent that was Libya s flag at independence . \nThe revolution in Libya was not interested in compromise or a managed transition . \nIt wanted a clean break : Qaddafi out and a new , more democratic regime , in . \nThe NTC and a clandestine Tripoli local council planned carefully for the military takeover of Tripoli and the restoration of services in the aftermath . \nWith three hundred mosques playing CDs chanting Allahu akbar ! \nQaddafi s forces on the evening of August 20 found themselves confused and then attacked from both inside and outside the city , which fell far more easily than anticipated . \nIn the weeks since , the new , unpaid local administration has achieved a great deal . \nIt sent technicians hundreds of kilometers to the south with support from local tribesmen to reactivate the wells that pump water into Qaddafi s Great Man-made River , which supplies Tripoli and other population centers . \nThe national government is making the usual social welfare payments . \nFlour and oil subsidies have been maintained , so bread is cheap and available . \nOnly partial withdrawal of salaries from banks is permitted , but Libyans are confident about the country s economic future , based on its oil and gas resources . \nLibyans know what to expect next . \nThe NTC has promised elections for an interim assembly by April 2012 and presidential elections by April 2013 . \nIt has published a constitutional framework that establishes Libya as both Islamic and democratic . \nThe contrast with Egypt , where I spent a week earlier this month , is striking . \nEgypt is a much larger , more complicated and poorer country . \nThere unity around the demand for President Hosni Mubarak s resignation deteriorated quickly once he resigned . \nLittle planning had been done . \nThe protesters asked the army to take over . \nUnprepared , it had to postpone elections even as the protest movement split , with secularists demanding a constitution , or at least constitutional principles , before elections and Islamists preferring it the other way around . \nEgyptians now do not know what to expect , though the first round of elections is now promised for November . \nSome of the protesters have now targeted Israel , diverting attention from Egypt s own problems and scaring off European and American tourists . \nThe economy is in a nose dive . \nResources are highly constrained . \nThings could go wrong in Libya . \nWe are still in the early days . \nQaddafi s forces could go underground and conduct the kind of insurgency that Saddam Hussein s secret services ignited in Iraq . \nFighting could erupt among the many militias that constitute the NTC s military forces . \nMany of them came from outside Tripoli . \nThey may refuse to go home or to disarm . \nIs the author of this article reporting from the Quatari sound stage where some of the Libyan press propaganda was filmed ? \n-LRB- events that never took place in Libya -RRB- There is no electricity , water is scarce , Tripoli is in ruins , people are dying . \nThere is gunfire and daily skirmishes . \nWhen you carpet bomb a City it takes decades to rebuild it . \nWhen I went to Dresden in 1992 , scars from WWII were still visible even after 40 years of the Allied carpet bombing . \nI suspect that Mr Serwer has never been to Libya or even in Africa : `` Trash collection is haphazard but functioning . '' \nWithout being facetious , there is no trash collecting in most African countries . \nPeople throw rubbish all over the place . \nAs long it is not in the way , it stays there until decomposes . \nDead donkeys , coke bottles , masonry . \n`` This is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed '' I am not sure if the author is aware that Libya is still at war . \nThe rebels are blowing up houses belonging to Ghaddafi supporters . \nCivil war is brewing . \nSince you think all is well in Tripoli , why do n't you go there on a holiday with your family to collect landmines ? \nAnother delusional article from Reuters ... This article is pure propaganda and fabricated reality . \nTripoli is in absolute shambles . \nThe TNC does not command the mob of rebels much less Libyan society . \nReuters is busy fabricating a virtual reality instead of providing news on the ground . \nNow this is what I call propaganda , what a weak article . \nReally , do you really believe people buy in to this garbage ? \nwhy are we crazy about exporting democracy to people in stone age ? \nreuters sucks ... Weak article ... The idea is to make people believe that is everything ok in lybia when the reality is completly different . \nComparison with Egypt is even worse . \nThey will never mention that the western powers support the military junta and the delay of a real democracy there since most of the egyptians are against Israel . \nSo sad ... I really expected more from Reuters . \nin reality Libya WAS ! \none of the most advanced nations in Africa\\/Arab world , after NTC and NATO ? \nhow many years has it been sent back ? \nhow do you know if the NTC wants democracy ? \nthey are full of ex members of the LIFG . \nand other Islamist groups . \nwhat do you really know about them ? \nThe war in Libya did not start with the USA or NATO bombing , it started with Gaddafi bombing his own people and Libyan cities . \nI have been to Libya and am traveling to Tripoli again on Tuesday . \nThe speed with which the country is coming together in the aftermath of the war is truly amazing . \nThere are still pockets of resistance in a couple of towns , but overall , Libya will be entirely freed from the captive of Gaddafi and his regime . \nLibya will not submit to any foreign intervention and will create its own democratic state . \nThe rebuilding of Libya will be quick and effective . \nThe people of Libya are determined not to repeat the lessons they have learned from the 41 of Gaddafi rule . \nThose who believe Libya was one of the most advanced nations in Africa prior to 17 February revolution should get their heads out of the sand and visit the many deprived towns and cities in Libya where people are still living in shacks after 41 years of the Gaddafi rule and where the average Libyan salary was no more than $ 200 per month ! \nA very accurate assessment of Tripoli , which I can confirm 100 % personally as I am currently sitting in my bedroom in the middle of Tripoli . \nElectricity is connected , water is running , food is plentiful , although still slightly more expensive than usual . \nRubbish is collected by neighborhood volunteers , and I must admit it is being collected far more frequently than before . \nThere is still multiple checkpoints throughout Tripoli , mainly present because Gaddafi supporters still wont accept defeat and still go around shooting people randomly in drive-by shootings . \nHowever , there has been very very few incidences of revenge by the freedom fighters and the Pro-democracy Tripoli population in general . \nMost previous supporters where allowed to assimilate with the revolutionaries , especially if they have no blood on their hands . \nGaddafi supporters that are armed have been requested to give up their arms voluntarily and most obliged . \nThe Gaddafi supporters that refused to unarm had their weapons confiscated by force . \nGenerally , the atmosphere is very positive in Tripoli . \nEvery night families go out to Martyrs Square to celebrate the victory . \nIn closing , I am surprised at the ill-informed comments , I thought reuters readers were more civilized and informed . \nDaniel Serwer is one of the very architects behind NATO intervention in Libya -- so do you think he 's going to admit it is a disaster unraveling into NATO sanctioned , even assisted genocide , with entire cities , Tawarga for example with a population of 10,000 being exterminated , imprisoned or exiled ? \nNope -- shame on Reuters for serving as an outlet for these craven liars , then again , you should know that Reuters is a member of many of these unelected policy think tanks were atrocities like NATO 's Libya intervention are cooked up in the first place . \n`` Libya has at least three important advantages : good leadership and clear goals at the national and local levels , careful planning and adequate resources . '' \nYou got to be kidding ! \nGood leadership -- a mixture of Islamists , former Kaddafi minsters and Esatern tribal leaders , that are already fighting each other and this will only continue . \n`` Careful planning '' ? \nNATO '' s bombing of Sirte ? \nOr summary executions of those who do not support the NTC ? \n`` Adequate resources '' ? \nLybia does have oil and it is its main source of revenue . \nBut now it was crippled by the war and will be taken over by the foreign oil producres , like TOTAL , Chevron and others . \nThis article is a joke , insulting people 's intelligence . \nNot everyone is completely zombified by Al Jazeera , CNN and Fox . \nCmon Serwer , some people here had also visited Lybia and have a very different picture . \nDaniel Serwer is a pathetic neo-colonialist short in morals & judgement . \nIf Tripoli is safe , why has NTC not moved there ? \nWhy contribute & condone the attack\\/murder of innocent people in Libya when that country has n't attacked any other ? \nThe world is watching you people ! \nUnless you you descent from your towers of superiority & arrogance , we will bring you down by force ! \nIs that the way to use the world 's resources , to destroy other resources & pollute an already suffering environment , while ignoring cries of enpoverished masses living next door to your mansions ? \nThe taciturnity of time will judge us all . \nA very accurate assessment of Tripoli , which I can confirm 100 % personally as I am currently sitting in my bedroom in the middle of Tripoli . '' \nIt 's no good . \nThey wo n't believe you . \nIf it has done one thing , the Arab Revolution has dragged a lot of squalid apologists for dictatorship out of a range of closets . \nFrom the ` liberal ' wimps to the Spartist ` Left ' , to Fox News and the Tea Party . \nNot to mention the Born-again Islamophobes . \nAll of them screaming in defense of the Imperialist puppet Gadaffi . \nAnd all destined for the dustbin of history , having completely failed to grasp that the world has changed . \nBut Libya can take the risk of ignoring their ideological dilemma , and their monumental arrogance in demanding that they run their country one way or another . \nIt is now theirs to run however they wish . \nIt is clear that the individuals criticizing this article have not been to Libya . \nNTC and NATO have saved the Libyan people . \nLibya is in a better conidition now ... it is going through the ups and downs of shaking dictatorship off and trying to reshape it 's future ... . \nas with regards to those who try to defend the tyrant gaddafi Well ... ask anyone about Gaddafi . . \neven before Feb 17 started ... thier first impression about Gaddafi is that he is a DICTATOR ... and who does n't know that ... unless you pretend not to know ... just simply think ... how can a person rule a country for 42 years without oppressing his own people ... now that gaddafi is gone there is a brighter future regardless of the painful stages that Libya is going through We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nDaniel Serwer is a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a scholar at the Middle East Institute . \nHe blogs at www.peacefare.net and tweets @DanielSerwer . \n"}

'' \nA Reuters reporter saw fighters withdraw around two km -LRB- more than a mile -RRB- after they had stormed into the town . \nNATO planes circled above the town later on Sunday and loud explosions were heard from the center , though it was not clear whether the planes had attacked . \nAnti-Gaddafi fighters from Bani Walid blamed comrades from elsewhere in Libya for being unwilling to coordinate . \nThose from elsewhere accused some local fighters of being traitors and passing information to Gaddafi loyalists . \n`` Commanders who are from the Warfalla tribe , they tell us one thing and then commanders from the other cities say something else . \nWe do not understand anything , '' said pro-NTC fighter Mohamed Saleh . \nSome fighters openly disobeyed orders . \nIn one incident , an officer from Bani Walid was heckled by troops from Tripoli after he tried to order them to stop randomly shooting in the air as they celebrated seizing a mortar from Gaddafi forces . \n`` You are not my boss . \nDo n't tell me what to do , '' one of the Tripoli fighters snapped back at him . \nShells whistled above anti-Gaddafi positions and exploded across the desert valley as invisible snipers sprayed bullets from Bani Walid 's rooftops and smoke rose above the town . \nNTC fighters helped some families leave the town , driving them out in military trucks . \n`` The past two weeks have been awful but last night was particularly bad , '' said Zamzam al-Taher , a 38-year-old mother of four . \n`` We have been trapped here without a car and with no food . \nSnipers are everywhere . '' \nNTC forces and NATO warplanes also attacked Sirte , Gaddafi 's birthplace . \nFighters launched rockets from the city 's southern entrance and traded fire with Gaddafi loyalists holed up in a conference center . \n`` The situation is very dangerous . \nThere are so many snipers and all the types of weapons you can imagine , '' said fighter Mohamed Abdullah as rockets whooshed through the air and black smoke rose above the city . \nAs in many episodes during Libya 's conflict , the front lines at Sirte and Bani Walid have moved back and forth , with shows of bravado crumbling in the reality of battle . \nAn incoming shell landed within 200 meters of NTC-held lines , only to be met with return fire from NTC fighters shouting `` Allahu Akbar ! '' \n-LRB- God is greatest -RRB- . \nSpeaking against the roar of NATO jets overhead , one anti-Gaddafi fighter at Sirte , Mahmoud Othman , said his men were helping families who had fled ahead of the next assault . \n`` We do n't want any more bloodshed between us . \nBut if the Gaddafa want more blood , we are ready , '' he said , referring to the deposed leader 's tribe . \n`` In the end we want Gaddafi . '' \nA spokesman for Gaddafi told Syrian-based Arrai TV on Sunday that 17 `` mercenaries '' , including what he called French and British `` technical experts '' had been captured in Bani Walid . \nIt was not immediately possible to verify the report . \nNATO , French and British officials had on Saturday denied a report by Arrai TV that NATO troops had been captured by Gaddafi loyalists . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIf the US had merely baldly stated that it desired a regime change and control over the Libyan oilfields , and then invaded forthwith , that would have truly spared civilian casualties . \nInstead , we have another UN `` police action '' civil war with all the inhuman brutality that entails ... The problem here is that we have become desensitized as a people to this . \nDaily we have a gawking , whorish media smilingly and mawkishly retailing of innocents killed in drive by drug gang warfare here at home . \nSo why should we give pause when we are told of a young girl killed in her backyard in Libya by a stray bullet that one of the rebels shot into the air in celebration . \nThe deceit of this charade is nothing less than disgusting , unless , of course , you have been lulled and stupefied like so many among us . \nTake a gander , if you dare , at Goya 's horrors of war etchings , look in the mirror and then ask yourself who is looking back ? \nAn army that is supposedly at 15 % of its original force -LRB- according to NATO -RRB- is holding off attacks from the air and from the ground . \nAs long as the NTC and their foreign backers do n't accept fact that the Gaddafi loyalists have the support and help of the people , Libya will continue in chaos . \nNo future for anyone . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nCaptured government troops said on Saturday they had been ordered to retreat from Misrata -- the only major rebel-held city in western Libya -- after a siege of nearly two months , and rebels fighting to overthrow Gaddafi had claimed victory . \nBut the mood of victory was short-lived and the prospect of a turning point in the two-month conflict dimmed on Sunday . \nGovernment forces bombarded three residential areas and the city center , including Tripoli Street , the thoroughfare that has been the scene of intense fighting in recent weeks , Abdelsalam said . \nRebel spokesman Safieddin said a large part of Tripoli Street was under the control of rebels , and that insurgents had launched an attack on the remaining Gaddafi forces after NATO air strikes on the city in the early hours . \nRebels have so far been unable to advance from eastern Libya as they fight with Gaddafi 's troops on the coastal road between the towns of Ajdabiyah and Brega , outgunned and lacking cash for equipment and state-building . \nRebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told a news conference in Kuwait on Sunday that the oil state would contribute 50 million Kuwaiti dinar -LRB- $ 177 million -RRB- to Libya 's rebel council . \nFellow Gulf Arab state Qatar , which has joined the Western military operations in Libya , has been marketing Libyan oil on behalf of the rebels to help them generate income . \nAn arms embargo on Libya is being enforced by NATO , but the rebels also need money to try to create the infrastructure of a state from scratch and care for victims of the conflict as they pursue their two-month-old battle to shake off Gaddafi 's rule . \n`` This amount will help us a lot in paying the salaries of employees who did not receive their little salaries for two months , '' Abdel Jalil said . \n`` We are capable of only covering 40 percent of this amount . \nWe are in need of urgent aid . '' \nHundreds have been killed in the fighting for Misrata , raising fears of a humanitarian crisis in the besieged city . \nSafieddin said at least 36 people had been killed there by Gaddafi 's forces since Saturday : eight during Sunday 's bombardment and 28 on Saturday , many killed by booby-traps left behind by retreating forces . \nMore than 100 had been wounded . \nA Qatari ship docked at the Tunisian port of Sousse overnight carrying 127 Libyans and 11 Tunisians from Misrata , the Tunisian state news agency said . \nRebels in their eastern stronghold Benghazi said they had no expectations of an early end to fighting in Misrata . \n`` I do n't think this is a real withdrawal , '' rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters . \nHe said government loyalists might be trying to stoke tensions between Misrata and neighboring towns , and that Gaddafi 's troops might return to the city later under the guise of intervening to protect local tribes from the rebels . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim had said the army would `` leave it to the tribes and the people around Misrata to deal with the situation , whether by using force or using negotiations .

'' \nLibyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's son Saif quickly dismissed the idea of his father stepping down . \n`` We want new blood , that 's what we want for Libya 's future . \nBut to talk of -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- leaving , that 's truly ridiculous , '' he told French news channel BFM TV . \n`` If the West wants democracy , a new constitution , elections , well , we agree . \nWe agree on this point but the West must help us to provide a propitious climate . \nBut all these bombings , this support given to rebel groups , all that is counter-productive . '' \nLibyan television said the `` colonial and crusader aggressors '' hit military and civilian sites in Al Jufrah district in central Libya on Monday . \nRebels in the coastal city of Misrata , under siege for six weeks , scorned reports that Gaddafi had accepted a cease-fire , saying they were fighting house-to-house battles with his forces , who fired rockets into the city . \nWestern leaders also rejected any deal that did not include Gaddafi 's removal , and NATO refused to suspend its bombing of his forces unless there was a credible cease-fire . \nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a Brussels news briefing that Gaddafi 's government had announced ceasefires in the past , but `` they did not keep their promises . '' \n`` Any future proposal that does not include this , we can not accept , '' he said , accusing Gaddafi of bombing , shelling and shooting civilians . \nA resident of Misrata told Reuters there was heavy fighting on the eastern approaches and in the center . \nRebels told Reuters that Gaddafi 's forces had intensified the assault , for the first time firing truck-mounted , Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . \nHuman Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . \nIt said about 250 people had died . \nAt the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- is already deployed in Libya 's rebel-held eastern territory , where it has supplied hospitals , distributed food and visited government soldiers captured during the conflict . \nSpeaking in Tripoli alongside a government spokesman , its regional head Jean-Michel Monod said his team had been officially invited to the capital . \n`` Now we will officially be here open for business , '' he told reporters . \n`` Of course it was high time as a neutral , impartial and independent humanitarian organization that the ICRC would come here as well to conduct discussions with the authorities . '' \nLibyan Social Affairs Minister Ibrahim Zarouk al-Sharif said some aid operations had been used as a cover to supply rebels . \n`` If humanitarian aid is brought through humanitarian organizations who specialise in this kind of work then we would welcome it . \nBut if it comes with a military face then we wo n't accept it , it 's basically a declaration of war and might lead to a much bigger conflict . '' \nAt talks in Luxembourg , Italy quarrelled with other European Union governments on how to handle thousands of migrants fleeing the turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in north Africa , while the EU executive urged the bloc to do more for the refugees . \nNATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . \nThe town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . \nOpposition fighters have been overwhelmed by Gaddafi 's firepower in western Libya , close to his base of Tripoli , but are increasingly using guerrilla tactics to weaken his hold . \nTripoli residents said there had been several attacks on army checkpoints and a police station in the last week and gunfire can be heard at night . \nGaddafi 's former foreign minister Moussa Koussa , speaking in Britain where he fled last month , called on `` everybody , all the parties , to work to avoid taking Libya into a civil war .

{"id": "61", "time": "2011-03-02", "text": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . \nFull Article ANALYSIS - Could Libya war crimes talk just entrench Gaddafi ? \nLONDON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:54 pm IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers hope threatening Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi with a war crimes trial at The Hague will help drive him from office , but some worry such talk might instead leave him thinking he has no way out . \nThe United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to refer Libya to the International Criminal Court following its crackdown on protesters . \nICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said on Monday attacks on civilians could be a crime against humanity and warranted a full investigation . \nBut -- just as with previous ICC probes into Congolese warlords , Sudan 's president and Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army -- there is the lingering worry that prosecutions will make compromise and finding a solution harder . \nPart of the problem , experts say , is that there is simply no real way to know what impact the threat will have on Libya 's always somewhat erratic leader . \n`` It 's a difficult balancing act , '' said Alia Brahimi , a research fellow on North Africa at the London School of Economics . \n`` There is a risk that taking an absolute moral and legalistic approach and talking about war crimes charges simply reinforces Gaddafi 's idea that he has nowhere else to go and no option to step down . \nBut on the flip side , it sends a strong message to those around him . '' \nHomegrown amnesty , truth and reconciliation processes -- rather than international prosecutions -- have been key to the resolution of several political crises or conflicts once thought intractable , such as the conflict between South Africa 's white apartheid rulers and the black majority . \nMany also doubt Northern Ireland 's decades of violence could have been brought hopefully to a close if Britain had still been looking to prosecute sometime IRA militants . \nA week into Libya 's uprising , the country is effectively divided between Gaddafi loyalist and opposition forces in what some fear could be the opening stages of a civil war . \nForeign governments say hundreds if not thousands have been killed already , while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis . \nOutside powers demand that Gaddafi stand down , threatening no-fly zones , sanctions and possibly further military action -- although critics say that can also back intransigent rulers into a corner . \nBut the foreign powers say the risk of war crimes charges should deter followers from attacking civilians and might help prompt his ouster . \n`` International prosecutions can sometimes carry risks , such as causing brutal dictators to entrench rather than step down and face justice , '' said Matthew Waxman , professor at Columbia Law School and fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . \n`` However , -LRB- they -RRB- can also help isolate perpetrators ... hastening their demise while also laying the foundation for longer term stability and serving broader interests in justice and deterrence . '' \nIt is possible any war crimes prosecution could still be halted in its tracks if foreign powers chose to do so . \nInterviewed by Reuters in 2005 shortly before the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the head of Uganda 's LRA leader Joseph Kony , prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said he might in general agree to halting proceedings in a country if that would bring peace . \nSome in Uganda and elsewhere had warned that issuing warrants against the LRA for child abduction and killing might make it impossible to reach an agreement with them . \nKony ultimately refused to sign a peace deal after talks hosted by South Sudan , some say because he feared ICC prosecution . \nHe and his fighters fled into nearby Congo and are still at large , continuing to raid villages there and in Sudan . \nBut Human Rights Watch 's head of the international justice program , Richard Dicker , said it was now barely even legally possible to simply cancel proceedings . \n`` The world has changed with the passing of the Rome Statute , '' he said , referring to the 2002 treaty establishing the ICC . \n`` There 's just not the legal option to offer ... to stop the legal process . \nThe option of letting Gaddafi walk away without any legal consequences just is n't on the table any more . '' \nIn reality , international justice remains likely to be highly selective . \nAny one of the permanent five UN Security Council members of the U.S. , Britain , France , Russia or China can effectively block a probe . \nThat means Chinese actions in Tibet and elsewhere , Russian clampdowns in Chechnya or alleged Western abuses in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay are all off the agenda . \nClose friends of Security Council powers such as U.S. ally Israel or China 's friends Myanmar or Sri Lanka also tend to enjoy more diplomatic cover . \n`` It 's a far from perfect system ... an uneven playing field , '' said Human Rights Watch 's Dicker . \n`` But I believe ... we are moving in the right direction . \nIf you look at eastern Congo , you have warlords who have been given amnesty time and time again ... in a short-term search for peace . \nThey have returned to commit even more vicious atrocities . \nYou have to have systems that will bring justice .

'' \nFurther bombing raids struck near the oil terminal in the afternoon . \nEstimates of the death toll during the day ranged between five and 14 . \nOil prices surged to near recent 2-1\\/2 year highs due to fears the unrest could spread to other OPEC producers . \nGaddafi , who once said ballot box democracy was for donkeys , told the gathering in Tripoli the world did not understand he had given power to the people long ago . \n`` We put our fingers in the eyes of those who doubt that Libya is ruled by anyone other than its people , '' he said , referring to his system of `` direct democracy '' launched at a meeting attended by visiting Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 1977 . \nA Tripoli resident and Gaddafi opponent , who did not want to be identified , told Reuters afterwards : `` Gaddafi will hang on for a while . \nIt 's not going to be easy for an unarmed crowd to face highly armed forces eager to shoot their own people . '' \nThe assault on Brega appeared to be the most significant military operation by Gaddafi since the uprising erupted in mid-February and set off a confrontation that Washington says could descend into a long civil war unless Gaddafi steps down . \nWitnesses said the attack was backed by heavy weapons and air strikes . \nOne of the witnesses said Gaddafi 's forces were 2-3 km from the city center and had 300-350 rebels pinned down at an oil industry airport on the city outskirts . \nHisham Mohammed , a 33-year-old mechanic on the side of the rebels , was defiant . \n`` I 'm going to Brega to help our brothers there . \nI 'm washed , I 've prayed , and I 'm ready to go to God , '' he told Reuters . \nAnalysts cautioned against drawing firm conclusions from fast moving events in a situation of erratic communications . \n`` The attack reinforces the idea that the government is capable of projecting power far into the east , '' said Shashank Joshi , an analyst at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute . \n`` But we should keep in mind that both the government and the rebels are trying to spin an image of momentum . '' \nIn Benghazi , the rebel National Libyan Council called for air strikes . \n`` We call for specific attacks on strongholds of these mercenaries , '' said council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga . \n`` The presence of any foreign forces on Libyan soil is strongly opposed . \nThere is a big difference between this and strategic air strikes . '' \nIn a possible response to Western hints that the opposition needs to unify to facilitate rebel links with outside powers , Ghoga added that a former justice minister , Mustafa Abdel , Jalil , would be chairman of the Council which will have 30 members and be based in Benghazi before moving later to Tripoli . \nLibya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , one of the first Libyan diplomats to denounce leader Muammar Gaddafi and defect , said the U.N. may back a resolution for a no-fly zone if the National Libyan Council officially requested it . \nAny sort of foreign military involvement in Arab countries is a sensitive topic for Western nations uncomfortably aware that Iraq suffered years of bloodletting and al Qaeda violence after a 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein . \nThe Arab League said it was against direct outside military intervention , but could enforce a no-fly zone over Libya in cooperation with the African Union . \nRealistically though , only the United States could carry out such an operation . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said U.S. military assets could be used to support the movement of supplies to areas in need but a no-fly zone was not an immediate priority . \n`` I think we are a long way from making that decision , '' Clinton told a Senate hearing . \n`` There is a great deal of caution that is being exercised with respect to any action we might take other than in support of humanitarian missions . '' \nTwo U.S. amphibious assault ships , the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ponce , passed through Egypt 's Suez Canal and arrived in the Mediterranean on Wednesday . \nThe White House said the ships were being redeployed in preparation for possible humanitarian efforts but stressed it `` was not taking any options off the table . '' \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates said : `` Our job is to give the president the broadest possible decision space . '' \nBut he said that enforcing a no-fly zone meant first attacking and destroying Libyan air defenses . \n`` A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses ... Then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down , '' Gates told a congressional hearing . \nThe uprising , the bloodiest yet against long-serving rulers in the Middle East , is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where thousands of foreign workers are trying to flee to safety . \nAt Ras Jdir on the Tunisia border , thousands of Bangladeshi migrant workers , desperate to leave Libya , pressed up against the gates of the frontier crossing , angry at their government for sending no help . \nGroups of West African migrant workers also in the crowd chanted for help and held up the flags of Ghana and Nigeria . \nAbout 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in the past two weeks , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWell we should n't have sold them to them in the first place !!!

'' \nWORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . \nAfter U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . \nIt was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . \nImmediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . \nA complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . \nThe bottling plant operators counter-sued . \nThen , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . \nThe U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . \nAccording to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . \n-LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB- \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Gaddafi 's forces entered Tripoli Street and Nakl al Theqeel road , '' he said by phone , referring to a main Misrata thoroughfare , scene of heavy clashes in recent weeks , and the road to the port . \n`` Witnesses said they saw pro-Gaddafi soldiers on foot in the city center today . \nExcept for snipers , they usually stay in their tanks and armored vehicles , '' the spokesman added . \nA government reconnaissance helicopter had flown over the city , he said , despite a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N.

{"id": "234", "time": "2011-08-16", "text": "Tue Aug 16 , 2011 12:00 pm EDT -LRB- Adds details , comment -RRB- Aug 16 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Six months of civil war have left Libya 's oil industry in chaos , with fields that once pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- deserted and export terminals , pumping stations and pipelines damaged by fighting and sabotage . \nLibya 's key oil production and export facilities are on the front line as rebel forces advance towards the capital of Tripoli and draw close to recapturing strategic assets in the key oil ports of Marsa El Brega and Zawiyah . \nAs the battle for control of Libya enters what may be its final phase , much of the country 's oil output could be resurrected within months if peace can be established , industry executives and analysts say . \nAlthough it will struggle to return to pre-war output for the foreseeable future , output of as much as 1 million bpd could be feasible within months , they say . \nMuch will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels , backed by NATO , trying to end his 41 years of rule . \nLibyan rebels said this week they had seized two strategic towns near Tripoli in quick succession , completing the encirclement of the capital and possibly heralding a period of more intense fighting across the country . \nIf Gaddafi and his allies quickly move to negotiate an end to fighting , damage to infrastructure could be minimized . \nBut even if Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish , his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . \nAnalysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division , which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power , jeopardising both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . \nFollowing are details of Libya 's oil industry , production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output . \nPRODUCTION AND EXPORTS \\* Until the beginning of this year , OPEC member Libya was the world 's 17th-largest oil producer and Africa 's third-largest . \nIt holds the continent 's largest crude oil reserves . \nIt sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe . \n\\* Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption , but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd , and exports have stopped altogether . \nMany oilfields are dependent on foreign workers , who have almost all left the country . \n\\* Most of Libya 's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin , which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces . \nMany other key parts of the country 's oil industry are still held by forces loyal to Gaddafi . \n\\* Libya has six major oil export terminals , listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA . \nThe condition of these facilities now is not clear : - Es Sider -LRB- 447,000 bpd -RRB- - Marsa El Brega -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- - Ras Lanuf -LRB- 195,000 bpd -RRB- - Tobruk -LRB- 51,000 bpd -RRB- - Zueitina -LRB- 214,000 bpd -RRB- - Zawiyah -LRB- 199,000 bpd -RRB- - other unspecified terminals -LRB- 333,000 bpd -RRB- DAMAGE \\* Damage to infrastructure was reported to be light during the first few months of fighting as both sides hoped to take full control of the country 's oil industry . \nIn March , officials said the terminals of Ras Lanuf , Zueitina and Es Sider had suffered only minor damage during fighting and some other oil towns had been left untouched . \n\\* But damage has increased as fighting has continued . \nA rebel spokesman said on Aug. 15 that Gaddafi 's troops planned to destroy the oil terminal in Brega , still held by fighters loyal to the government , to prevent it from falling into opposition hands . \nRebels say Gaddafi 's forces sabotaged two large oil tanks over the weekend , which have been sending up clouds of smoke . \nBrega refinery was reported to be still intact but could be a target , rebels said . \n\\* It has not been possible to independently confirm reports of damage being done to oil installations , an accusation rebels have previously levelled at government forces . \nLIBYAN OIL COMPANIES \\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \n\\* Since fighting began , the Libyan National Council , with the help of Qatar has been able to export a minimal amount of crude oil in the form of two partially laden tankers . \nThe oil for these cargoes was reported previously to have been in storage . \nOne of these cargoes went to a U.S. refinery and the other to Italy . \nNo exports have been reported for several weeks . \n\\* It is not clear how the oil industry will be structured after the war , but it may be placed in the hands of the Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- , a company now run by Libyan rebels . \nRESTORATION - ANALYSTS ' VIEWS \\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials last month forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \n\\* The longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . \nHe said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \n\\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie says it will take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . \nIt estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . \nBut the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \n\\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \n\\* `` Once there is a degree of security for their personnel , it should not take too long for the oil firms to get their workers back in . \nIf the money 's right they will go back , '' said Mike Wittner , Societe Generale head of oil market research in New York . \nBut it was difficult to assess how much damage had been done to oil facilities during the war , he said . \n`` No one really has a clear idea of how much damage to the oil infrastructure there has been ... Anytime you shut a field down quickly and run off in a panic there will be problems . '' \nFOREIGN OIL COMPANIES \\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \n\\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . \nIts contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \n\\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . \nThe legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified . \nThe table below is based on data from consultancy IHS Herold and Reuters reports : Company ' 000 bpd Libya Libya Libya Status share of share of share of -LRB- last total oil total gas oil & gas reported -RRB- -LRB- pct -RRB- -LRB- pct -RRB- -LRB- pct -RRB- Eni 108 10.7 18 13.7 Unclear Wintershall 98.6 72.0 4 29.2 Shut Total SA 60 4.3 0 2.7 Shut An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` We ca n't prevent the scuds but we hope NATO can . \nNATO has the technology to detect them . '' \nAnalysts say the rebels ' strategy now is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse , but they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last-ditch fight for the capital . \nIn a barely audible telephone call to state television in the early hours of Monday morning , Gaddafi called on his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their NATO supporters . \n`` Get ready for the fight ... The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield , '' he said . \nHe was speaking as rebels made their most dramatic advances in months of fighting , shifting the momentum in a conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of NATO powers anxious for a swift outcome . \nRebel forces in the Western Mountains south of Tripoli surged forward at the weekend to enter Zawiyah . \nThe town is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and , crucially , straddles the main highway linking the capital to Tunisia . \nA day later , rebels said they had captured the town of Garyan , which controls the highway leading south from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha , a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the desert . \n`` Gaddafi has been isolated . \nHe has been cut off from the outside world , '' a rebel spokesman from the Western Mountains , called Abdulrahman , told Reuters by telephone . \nEarly on Tuesday , rebels on the outskirts of Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of the town , from where they have been attacking with mortars , Grad rockets and sniper fire . \nMedical workers at one of the town 's hospitals said 20 people , a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians , were killed on Monday , and the death toll for Tuesday had reached one . \nOfficials in Tripoli deny Zawiyah is under rebel control , but government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim acknowledged on state television that rebel fighters were in Garyan . \n`` There are still armed gangs inside the city . \nWe are able to drive them out , '' he said . \nA U.N. envoy arrived in neighbouring Tunisia , where sources say rebels and representatives of the government have been holed up on the island resort of Djerba for negotiations . \nTunisia 's official news agency on Tuesday quoted the envoy , Abdel Elah al-Khatib , as saying he knew nothing of any negotiations in Djerba . \nSpeaking in Tunis , he said he held informal talks with representatives of Gaddafi 's government and the rebel council . \nThe envoy did not say who they were or what they discussed . \nGaddafi 's spokesman denied Tripoli was in talks about the leader 's departure , saying reports of such negotiations were the product of a `` media war '' being waged against Libya . \nTalks could signal the endgame of a civil war that has drawn in the NATO alliance and emerged as one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world . \nRebels may still lack the manpower for an all-out assault on Tripoli , but are hoping their encirclement of the capital will bring down Gaddafi 's government or inspire an uprising . \nIn the past , however , they have frequently failed to hold gains , and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back . \nPro-Gaddafi residents of the capital remain defiant . \nMakhjoub Muftah , a school teacher who has signed up as a gun-toting pro-Gaddafi volunteer , like many others seemed to think a rebel advance into Tripoli was a remote possibility . \n`` I wish they would march into Tripoli . \nI wish , '' he said , daring the rebels . \n`` They will all die .

{"id": "266", "time": "2011-08-16", "text": "LONDON | Tue Aug 16 , 2011 11:28 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tripoli might be cut off and Libya 's war moving to its endgame , but even if Muammar Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . \nLibya 's rebels said on Tuesday they had completed moves to cut off roads to the capital after rapid advances in the west . \nThe defection of a senior Gaddafi security official further reinforced the image of crumbling central authority . \nBut analysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition , too , remains riven by internal division that could prompt new fighting , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . \nWhile sources say members of the opposition and government have held secret meetings in Tunisia that also involve a U.N. envoy , many doubt Gaddafi and his sons would cede power even with a guarantee of immunity from international prosecution . \nEven his death might not end his family 's influence . \n`` Gaddafi will have plenty of tricks up his sleeves until his very last breath , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle Eastern politics at the U.S. Naval War College . \n`` He will have instructed his sons and circle of loyalists -- especially those remaining in the security services -- to plant as many obstacles in the rebels ' and transitional government 's paths as possible , even in his absence . '' \nThe rebels and NATO may hope an uprising or coup in Tripoli would let them enter the city without the kind of street battle that would challenge the skills of both rebels and Western air forces . \nBut not everyone believes such an outcome is likely . \n`` Unrest in Tripoli remains limited to small scale bouts of localized unrest and shortages during Ramadan caused by the opposition 's militias could fuel resentment against them rather than the regime , '' said Henry Smith , Libya analyst for risk consultancy Control Risks . \nHaving initially hoped a flurry of NATO air strikes would be enough to oust Gaddafi , the mood in many Western capitals darkened the point of outright pessimism as the war dragged on . \nRecent rebel military success might make it easier for NATO states to extend their military campaign when they next meet on August 31 , but longer term worries are already building . \nThe killing last month of Abdel Fattah Younes , military chief for the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , by rival rebels further strengthened views of Gaddafi 's opponents in the east as divided among themselves . \nRebels in the west -- who have made most of the recent military gains -- have also openly voiced dissatisfaction with the lack of progress made by the Benghazi-based eastern bloc . \nOil firms in particular worry that even a relatively easy end to the war could simply set the stage for more chaos . \nAt worst , they fear a collapse into a new and more complex civil war . \nAt the very least , bureaucratic and political infighting could make a return to prewar business impossible . \n`` The place will not necessarily become more peaceful if Gaddafi goes , '' said one Western risk consultant advising several major firms on Libya investments . \n`` You will have ex-Gaddafi people , the NTC and expats from the trading families returning , '' he said . \n`` And they will be at each other 's throats . '' \nA July report from oil specialists Wood Mackenzie estimated that even after a possible overthrow of Gaddafi it could take around 36 months for Libya to resume full oil production of 1.6 million barrels per day , roughly 2 percent of global output . \nEven with the swift lifting of international sanctions , many oil firms look likely to hang back from sending in teams to restart old projects or from investigating new ones . \n`` Even if Gaddafi does go it will be far from a smooth transition , '' said one oil executive and security specialist . \n`` Remove a dictator and destroy his security apparatus and you are left with a scenario remarkably like Iraq , and look how long that has taken . '' \nSaddam Hussein was overthrown more than eight years ago , but the country remains very troubled . \nWestern governments too also seem reluctant to plunge deeper into greater involvement in a post-Gaddafi Libya . \nSources with knowledge of post-war planning say some has taken place , but it is largely limited to a relatively few civilian officials . \nWith Western powers exhausted by Iraq and Afghanistan and now dealing with economic crisis and perhaps even a rising risk of civil unrest at home , few believe they have the appetite for large peacekeeping missions that could last years . \nWhile Libya does not have the same Sunni-Shi ` ite sectarian division that rendered post-Saddam Iraq such a tinderbox , it does have complex tribal divisions that could fuel conflict . \nSome suspect that even after a Gaddafi departure it could remain effectively somewhat divided into east and west along ancient provincial boundaries . \nBut physical conflict and further damage to oil facilities is not the only worry for oil firms who spent years courting Gaddafi to gain access to the country . \nIn the potentially febrile atmosphere of postwar Libya , they fear massive renegotiation of contracts and the digging up of old secrets . \n`` The biggest threat to oil firms is that the new regime will inevitably try to investigate who paid what to secure contracts with Gaddafi , '' said the anonymous political risk consultant . \n`` The firms will either have to pay again or face the risk of information being disclosed publicly and potentially ending up in courts in Europe and the U.S. '' -LRB- Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov ; editing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nLove or hate Gaddafi , there is no doubting he has majority backing from tribes . \nRegardless of how people feel , the real cost of this war is yet to come . \nBecause without security , no foreign contractor -LRB- oil or otherwise -RRB- can return a profit from Libya ventures . \nSo what 's the plan ? \nThere really is n't one , is there ? \nGaddafi has never been anything than a mad tyrant . \nHe oppressed the berber tribes ; banned them to speak their own language , having their old culture . \nHe sponsored terrorism inside and outside of Libya . \nKillings , rapes , corruption , unemployment , suffering . \nHe killed hundreds of innocent people blowing 3 airplanes . \nHe tortured his own people , he stolen money from Libya . \nThere is nothing good about Gaddafi . \nOnly someone with absolutely no knowledge whatsoever of Libya would say he has been a good person . \nAny Quaddafi actions pale in comparison to the plunder NATO nations inflicted on Africa , and the rest of the world in form of slave trade , colonization and today through neo-colonization . \nIt is true that traitors existed in the past and still exist . \nThey ally with invaders to sell off the sovereignty , citizens and wealth in exchange for modern ammunition and some candy . \nSo to expect anything from NATO after the destruction of a country is day dreaming . \nA weak Libya is easier to plunder , this will be enabled more by the rag-tag rebels in power plus in fighting or squabbles that are sure to follow Quaddafi 's exit due to NATO\\/UN bombs use to impose a puppet regime installed over Libyans with NATO bombs over the heads UN\\/NATO\\/Libyan opposition could have done better . \nAU and Libyan Govt so far have been the sensible parties . \nTurkey , Qatar and Arab league have betrayed Libyans by supporting the war instead of promoting peace to gain cheap favor from the west , especially European Union . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nNTC officers say Gaddafi loyalists fear reprisals if they give themselves up . \nSome captured fighters have been roughed up by NTC forces and Amnesty International issued a report on Wednesday saying Libya 's new rulers were in danger of repeating human rights abuses commonplace during Muammar Gaddafi 's rule . \nThe NTC said it would look into the report . \nClose to the center of the fighting in Sirte , government forces found 25 corpses wrapped in plastic sheets . \nThey accused Gaddafi militias of carrying out execution-style killings . \nFive corpses shown to a Reuters team wore civilian clothes , had their hands tied behind their backs and gunshot wounds to the head . \nAs the tanks pounded the apartment blocks where Gaddafi 's men are holed up , pick-up trucks mounted with heavy machine guns moved in behind , then infantry armed with AK-47s began their assault . \nOne field hospital received two NTC dead and 23 wounded on Thursday . \nOne of the dead men had been hit while taking food up to the fighters on the front line , doctors said . \nIn the skies , NATO aircraft have been carrying out reconnaissance missions and Britain said its jets had bombed and destroyed two pick-up trucks belonging to Gaddafi 's forces in Sirte on Wednesday . \nBut as the battle for Libya draws toward what the NTC and NATO hope will be a close , both the new government and the Western alliance which helped topple Gaddafi are looking toward a return to normality . \nThe provisional Libyan government and NATO signed an agreement on Thursday to immediately open air corridors for international civilian flights from Benghazi , and domestic flights between the second city and Tripoli and Misrata . \nThis is one of the first step toward NATO lifting its no-fly zone over Libya imposed after Gaddafi began a military assault on civilians protesting his one-man rule . \nGerman Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said 150 wounded Libyans would be treated in Germany . \nBerlin plans to support Libya with medical supplies and aid and help in training and educating young Libyans , he said `` We are here because we see the most important raw material of Libya , it is not oil and gas ... -LRB- it is -RRB- the younger people who started the revolution here . \nThey need future and perspective after their victory , '' Roesler told a news conference in Tripoli . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nother media outlets are saying a different story , maybe maybe not . \nit has not been confirmed as 100 % fact . \nso why does your headlines read as such ? \nbecause you and the rest of the MSM believe whatever the NTC and NATO tells you . \nand the other side that is now the new rebels dont get any voice . \nAre these nutcases celebrating the death of their country ... as they better wake up Right ! \nDrop me a line when Rasmussen is captured . \nand the 17 CIA agents and SAS soldiers allegedly captured in Libya . \nWe want to see them playing Russian roulette to decide who will rule Libya ...

{"id": "72", "time": "2011-03-03", "text": "LONDON | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 11:37 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Anyone who thought that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi would go quietly like his fellow dictators in Tunisia and Egypt may have to think again . \nHe has never shied from spilling blood , and his end may well prove a bloody affair . \nGaddafi has shown this week that he clearly intends to fight on and leading Libyan analysts say regime change will only come if those close to him force him aside . \nThe Libyan leader , experts say , believes so profoundly that he is the embodiment of his country that he is willing to bring Libya down rather than give in a two-week-long revolt against his 41-year autocratic rule . \n`` There is a real danger that Libya is sliding toward a long , protracted civil war , '' said Fawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics . \n`` From everything we have seen so far Gaddafi is cornered , his back is to the wall and he has no exit strategy . \nHe will most likely fight to the bitter end , '' he added . \nOn the ground , Gaddafi appeared to have taken the initiative by launching a ground and air attack on rebels in control of the eastern oil terminal town of Brega . \nBoth rebels and pro-Gaddafi forces are arming and positioning themselves for a longer fight and residents and tribes are being armed as well by both sides . \n`` In the last 48 hours Gaddafi seemed to have absorbed the first shock . \nHe is consolidating his limited power base , '' said Gerges . \n`` The Gaddafi regime is positioning itself for a prolonged fight . \nHe has adequate military and financial assets to fight . \nEven though Gaddafi has lost control over large swathes of Libya he seems ready to reduce the country to Somalia-like ruins rather than surrender power , experts say . \n`` Gaddafi reduced the Libyan people to his persona , '' said Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer who was involved in the negotiations over the Lockerbie bombing . \n`` Gaddafi 's aim will be to create chaos and put the country through civil war or Somalisation -- no central power , a divided country in which he will remain a force , '' said Djebbar . \n`` Gaddafi has containers of dollars , he has guns to arm people and he has loyalists , the more chaos he creates the better -LRB- for him -RRB- , '' Djebbar added . \n`` His message is : apres moi le deluge . \nYou force me out of power and I will leave either a divided country or a country in civil war like Somalia . '' \nThe uprising , the bloodiest yet against despotic rulers in the region , was sparked by the arrest of a human rights lawyer in Benghazi on February 14 . \nRevolt quickly spread , with Libyans from all walks of life -- professionals , academics , tribesmen , former soldiers and students -- demanding an end to Gaddafi 's repressive rule . \nLibyans have not experience democracy since he ousted King Idris and created a police state in 1969 . \nThe mercurial leader has managed to cling to power through a carefully constructed security apparatus . \nThe press remains gagged , despite a slight easing of curbs in recent years , freedom of speech is unheard of and political parties are illegal . \nBut 41 years of repression have brought simmering discontent to the boil . \nAdded to that , for many Libyans and world leaders , the former army officer is the evil hand behind terrorism inside and outside his country . \nGaddafi has spent much of Libya 's oil cash financing terrorists responsible for hijacks and killings and groups seeking to kill dissidents and destabilize pro-Western governments in Africa . \nThe Libyan upheaval has not only proven to be bloodier and costlier but more protracted than Tunis and Egypt , raising the risks of ethnic war that could fragment the country , trigger a humanitarian crisis and further jeopardize oil supplies . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia , powerful military elites ultimately decided the outcome of the revolutions , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from office . \nBut in Libya it is more opaque and complex tribal power structures could decide how events play out . \nHaving risen through the military himself , Gaddafi emasculated the army to prevent its commanders from threatening him following periodic failed coup attempts . \n`` He knows from his own experience that coup d'etats come from the army so he closed the way for any potential coup d'etat a long time ago . \nHe dismantled the army and set up instead what he called the popular army , '' said Djebbar . \nHe created well-armed and tightly knit brigades led by his own al-Gaddadfa tribe and by al-Magarha , another tribe headed by Abdullah Sanussi , Gaddafi 's brother-in-law and chief enforcer . \nExperts agree that part of the explanation for Gaddafi 's survival is linked to having his sons in charge of his security and his own tribe occupying the most important positions . \n`` His units are die-hard loyalists , based on skin and kin , blood ties which for Gaddafi are more important than ideology . \nHe has his son Khamis who is in charge of a special army unit , '' Djebbar said . \nThose familiar with Gaddafi say he is the only decision-maker , a man with absolute authority who does not delegate power to anybody , not even to his own sons . \nOn the ground , the balance of power looks equal . \nGaddafi and his forces control the capital Tripoli and some nearby towns as well as his birthplace Sirte further east , the site of large arsenals and bases designed to guard oil infrastructure . \nThe rebels hold Benghazi , Misrata and Zawiyah and Jebel Nafusa southwest of Tripoli . \n`` Gaddafi has not given up , the attack he launched on Brega is an indication that he intends to carry on , '' said George Joffe , a Middle East expert at Cambridge University . \nDespite the defection of large numbers of tribes some still support him including his own Gaddadfa community . \n`` The forces on the ground might be quite well balanced . \nIt really can go on for quite some time . \nIf you control Benghazi you control -LRB- the eastern region of -RRB- Cyrenaica , '' said Joffe . \n`` If you control Tripoli you control Tripolitania . \nIn those circumstances you could have two forces relatively well balanced who can confront each other for a long time . '' \nOn the table is a peace plan devised by from Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez , according to Secretary-General Amr Moussa . \nVenezuela says Gaddafi has accepted it , but there has been no confirmation . \nRebels have said they would not negotiate with Gaddafi , and their reaction to the plan is not known . \nOne scenario for a peaceful exit is to have some sort of tribal deal . \nThis might see a combination of the sons of Gaddafi , his daughter and Sanussi push him aside and allow the Gaddadfa tribe and al-Magarha , former officers and dignitaries to enter into talks with tribes in the east to grant Gaddafi safe passage to retire in his hometown of Sirte . \nThey in turn could make commitments to guarantee the security of the family . \nThe other option is for him to go abroad with immunity from prosecution . \nBut this option may not be possible after the International Criminal Court said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle could be investigated for alleged crimes committed against civilians by security forces . \nJoffe said he suspected Gaddafi would eventually be overthrown in a palace coup . \n`` The way it will come to an end is if his domestic support ends from his family , tribes , his own battalion or army unit -- if they remove their support he is finished ...

'' \nThe Sirte basin holds reservoirs with over 43 billion barrels of oil , which are tapped from both east and west , but it 's at risk of being cleaved down the middle . \nA trunk pipeline supplies oil flows that end up both in Ras Lanuf , still under Gaddafi 's control , and terminals further east which are run by AGOCO , a unit of the state-run National Oil Company that is now under the control of anti-Gaddafi engineers , Ciszuk said . \nAGOCO typically ships up to 450,000 bpd . \nReports in recent days have shown tankers are still leaving Libya , but it 's not entirely clear who gets the revenue , Gaddafi or rebels . \nDigging in its heels , AGOCO has said it may start its own marketing division to negotiate with foreign buyers . \nGaddafi-aligned oil minister Shokri Ganem , meanwhile , has claimed Libya 's oil sector remains firmly under regime control . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France and Britain would support the idea of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya if Gaddafi 's forces continued to attack civilians . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said the United States and the international community must be ready to act rapidly to stop violence against civilians or a humanitarian crisis in Libya . \nThe uprising , the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Middle East or North Africa , has torn through the OPEC-member country and knocked out nearly 50 percent of its 1.6 million barrels per day output , the bedrock of its economy . \nIn eastern Libya , witnesses said a warplane bombed Brega the oil terminal town 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , for the second day , part of a struggle for control of a strategically vital coast road and oil industry facilities . \nWarplanes also launched two raids against the nearby rebel-held town of Ajbadiya , witnesses said . \nBut Juma Amer , Secretary for African Affairs at the Libyan Foreign Ministry , told journalists : `` Media reports that civilian areas were bombed are false . \nPolice had been and are urged to use maximum self restraint . '' \nSaif said Brega was bombed to scare off militia fighters and to gain control of oil installations . \n`` First of all the bombs -LRB- were -RRB- just to frighten them to go away , '' he told Britain 's Sky News . \nOn the ground , rebels leading the unprecedented popular revolt pushed their front line west of Brega . \nThey said they had driven back troops loyal to Gaddafi to Ras Lanuf , site of another major oil terminal and 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . \nThey also said they had captured a group of mercenaries . \nIn an angry scene at al-Uqayla , east of Ras Lanuf , a rebel shouted at a captured young African and alleged mercenary : `` You were carrying guns , yes or no ? \nYou were with Gaddafi 's brigades yes or no ? '' \nThe silent youth was shoved onto his knees into the dirt . \nA man held a pistol close to the boy 's face before a reporter protested and told the man the rebels were not judges . \nIn The Hague , International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle , could be investigated for alleged crimes committed since the uprising broke out in mid-February . \n`` We have identified some individuals in the de facto or former authority who have authority over the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . \n`` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had this de facto authority . \nThere are also some people with formal authority who should pay attention to crimes committed by their people . '' \nLibyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told BBC radio the news from The Hague was `` close to a joke . '' \n`` No fact-finding mission has been sent to Libya . \nNo diplomats , no ministers , no NGOs or organizations of any type were sent to Libya to check the facts ... No one can be sent to prison based on media reports , '' he said . \nIbrahim Mohammad Ali , a spokesman for the public security department , said Libya had told the United Nations it would allow visits by independent human rights observers . \nLibya is not a signatory of the ICC treaty , `` but we are willing to deal with the ICC and take action against anyone who has acted outside the law , '' he told a Tripoli news conference . \nA spokesman for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Gaddafi ally , said the Libyan government had accepted a Venezuelan plan to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Libya . \nArab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the plan was under consideration and he was waiting for details from Caracas . \nOil prices fell briefly on news of the plan , but traders said the fall was due to profit-taking and they were sceptical about any Venezuelan mediation . \nBrent crude fell more than $ 3 but by 2000 GMT had recovered to $ 114.82 . \nChavez 's plan would involve a commission from Latin America , Europe and the Middle East trying to reach a negotiated outcome between the Libyan leader and rebel forces . \nAn aide to Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebels ' National Libyan Council , told Reuters the rebels were open to talks only on Gaddafi 's resignation or exile to avoid more bloodshed . \n`` There is nothing else to negotiate , '' he said . \nHe also called for foreign air strikes to set up a `` no-fly zone '' to help the rebels topple Gaddafi . \nSave The Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres said they were struggling to get medicine and care to Libya 's needy , with gunmen blocking roads and civilians too scared to seek help . \nThe government has tried to persuade people in Tripoli that life continues as normal . \nBut there were queues at banks , and residents said food prices had gone up and the street value of the Libyan dinar had fallen dramatically against the dollar . \nThe official news agency said the Libyan parliament had cut car fuel prices by 25 percent to 0.15 dinars -LRB- $ 0.12 -RRB- a litre . \nA fish market near Tripoli 's Green Square was mostly empty . \n`` The situation is affecting us , '' said Ismail , a fisherman . \n`` All the Egyptian workers who run the boats have left .

'' U.S. ambassador to the council Eileen Donahoe said the report should not be adopted until `` the voices of the Libyan people , and not just the voice of the Gaddafi regime , can be reflected '' in the final text . \nGaddafi struck at rebel control of a key coastal road for a second day on Thursday but received a warning he would be held to account at an international war crimes tribunal in the Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces . \nCountries who praised Libya during the November session , part of the five-year-old council 's Universal Periodic Review -LRB- UPR -RRB- process of all U.N. member states , included Iran , Algeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , North Korea , Pakistan and Myanmar . \nBut last Friday several of these who are members of the council -- including Pakistan and Algeria -- supported a resolution launching an international inquiry into the ongoing crackdown on protestors and asked the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Libya 's membership in the 47-member Geneva forum . \nThe General Assembly , in which all U.N. member states sit , unanimously agreed to the move on Tuesday -- less than a year after three quarters of countries in the New York body had approved Libya 's accession to the rights council . \nThe UPR process is supposed to provide an objective review of each country 's performance in observing international rights pacts which they have signed and underpin U.N. documents like the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . \nBut critics say the process has been marked by determination among a majority council bloc of developing countries to ward off serious criticism by heaping praise on their allies -- as they do also in the council itself . \nNeuer of U.N. Watch , which closely monitors the council , said it should recognize the UPR on Libya was a fraud , withdraw the report and schedule a new session in which council countries `` would tell the truth about the Gaddafi regime 's heinous crimes .

{"id": "7", "time": "2011-03-03", "text": "WASHINGTON | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 10:02 am EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - An unpublished U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks tells the previously undisclosed story of how an American corporate powerhouse -- the $ 35-billion Coca-Cola Co. -- got caught up in a fierce fraternal dispute between two of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's sons . \nThe contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified 2006 U.S. cable put it . \n`` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ? \nWe 've been living it for the last few months , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli . \nThe cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centers on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for three months . \nIt had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed . \n-LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given . -RRB- \nEventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government . \nThe document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party . \nShortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car . \nThe Coca-Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables . \nAmong other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in late 2003 to abandon his nuclear weapons program . \nA spokesman for Coca-Cola acknowledged there had been `` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable . \nBut the problem was `` resolved amicably '' by the end of 2006 , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca-Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the current unrest . \nA spokesman for the State Department said : `` We will decline to comment on any particular cable . \nThe U.S. has taken aggressive action in recent days to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family . \nThus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . '' \nWORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca-Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi . \nAfter U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established . \nIt was co-owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo-era Libyan soft-drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi . \nImmediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo-era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly-opened plant , alleging breach of contract . \nA complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had `` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable . \nThe bottling plant operators counter-sued . \nThen , on December 28 , 2005 -- two weeks after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally-bottled batches of Coke -- `` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats . \nThe U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca-Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser . \nAccording to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had `` taken over '' the embargo-era domestic soft-drink business in the late 1990s when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for `` insubordination '' against their father . \n-LRB- Another cable says the `` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt . -RRB- \nSporadic violent incidents continued to erupt in the weeks after Mutassim 's forces occupied the bottling plant . \nEarly in the siege , a businessman affected by the squabble told American diplomats , the occupation force would allow plant managers to enter the building alone or in pairs . \nBut later employees were barred from the facility . \nDuring the weeks that followed , according to the State Department account , anonymous callers threatened three Coca-Cola employees , all Jordanian citizens , with `` political problems '' and bodily harm . \nComplaints to police , and later to Muammar Gaddafi himself , were met with indifference . \nThe Libyan leader , according to the cable , `` declined to get involved personally '' yet urged plant owners to do `` everything within -LRB- their -RRB- power to resolve the matter according to Libyan law . '' \nThen , shortly before the plant reopened , Mutassim 's men `` abducted and assaulted '' one of Mohammed Gaddafi 's in-laws to `` send a signal , '' according to the cable . \nEarlier that day , it reported , one of Mohammed 's associates , after hearing Mutassim `` raging , '' phoned one the bottling plant 's founder to warn him to `` leave the city immediately '' because Mutassim 's men were coming to get him . \nThat night , a posse of Mutassim 's associates turned up outside his brother 's home and began shouting for Mohammed Gaddafi to come outside . \nWhen they got no response , the cable reports , Mutassim 's men grabbed `` one of Mohammed 's cousins , '' who they proceeded to stuff into the trunk of one of their cars . \nThe cable does not report the cousin 's ultimate fate . \nAbout a month later -- soon after the bottling plant had reopened -- two more violent incidents involving Mutassim Gaddafi occurred , according to the cable . \nOn one occasion , according to a witness who talked to American diplomats , Mutassim personally `` assaulted '' an unnamed cousin of Mohammed Gaddafi -LRB- `` on his mother 's side '' , according to the cable -RRB- who was a member of the Libyan Olympic Committee headed by Mohammed . \nA day earlier , the cable said , Mutassim had assaulted another of Mohammed 's cousins . \n-LRB- The cable does not make clear whether either of these cousins might have been the cousin who earlier had been stuffed in a car trunk . -RRB- \nIt was in the wake of these episodes that one of the U.S. diplomatic mission 's contacts offered the comment comparing his situation to `` The Godfather . '' \nIn a `` hushed voice , '' the cable reports , the contact advised his American interlocutor that while he had heard `` stories '' about doing business in Libya , he had `` never imagined '' that what had occurred was still possible . \n`` ALL PARTIES '' WANTED STORY HUSHED UP After the bottling plant returned to operation , according to the State Department 's account , some contacts of U.S. diplomats said that a settlement between Mohammed and Mutassim Gaddafi had been brokered by their sister Aisha , described in other cables as a frequent arbiter of disputes among her fractious siblings . \nBut other embassy contacts said that Mohammed Gaddafi decided on his own to lessen tensions with Mutassim by selling the Olympic Committee 's shares to a third party . \nThe U.S. mission in Libya claimed some credit for helping to defuse the standoff . \nThe cable says that because the principal company involved in operating the Tripoli bottling plant was not an American entity , U.S. diplomats were limited in what they could do . \nBut in an effort to `` protect the broad interests of a brand representing several million USD in annual sales to a U.S.-based company , '' U.S. diplomats did contact influential Libyan officials to urge that the brotherly dispute be resolved : the U.S. mission sent what the cable describes as a `` strongly worded diplomatic note '' expressing `` serious concern over the plant closure and noting the growing risk of severe damage to U.S. investor confidence in Libya . '' \nTwo days later , the plant reopened . \nThe State Department cable describes the Coca-Cola conflict as a `` case study in the involvement of Qadhafi -LRB- sic -RRB- family members directly influencing the flow , pace and nature of economic activity . \nFamily members squabble over personal financial interest with little regard to the possible impact on foreign investors or international public opinion . '' \nThe Coca-Cola case , the cable adds , `` is typical of the power struggles likely to continue as the Qadhafi children and other regime elite continue to define -LRB- or re-define -RRB- their respective spheres of commercial influence . '' \nApart from a brief mention on a website operated by Libyan dissidents , the cable adds , it was `` noteworthy that the news was kept out of the press , '' since `` all parties involved -- including the foreign companies -- had an interest in keeping things quiet as long as there seemed a possibility of a near-term solution .

'' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe this week criticised NATO for not doing enough to stop the bombing of Misrata and Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said he regretted the lack of military strikes by partners such as the United States . \n`` NATO is not able at this time to oblige partners to participate in this action . \nLike you , I deplore for example the fact that France and Britain are bearing the brunt of this effort , even if the United States is still providing essential aerial back-up , '' Longuet told parliament on Tuesday . \n"}

'' \nAbassi , who is Tunisian , said the World Bank had been working with Libya since 2006 on plans for economic reforms led by leader Muammar Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Islam , although many of those reform plans were scuppered by Gaddafi . \nHe described some of the leaders of the rebel Transitional National Council as among those most strongly associated with economic reform plans . '' \n...

'' \nA flurry of poor economic data from the United States and Europe in the past week has already led to a sharp correction in risk assets . \nIn the short-term the market will focus on a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday for hints of more quantitative easing , but U.S. investment bank Citigroup -LRB- C. N -RRB- noted this week that even if the United States printed more money , weak economic growth and fresh supplies from Libya would weigh on prices . \n`` If crude prices have been retreating in August , it was not because of positive expectations on the restart of crude oil exports from Libya but on negative expectations about oil demand , '' Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said in a note . \nBrent crude futures were trading above $ 110 a barrel on Friday morning . \n`` Growth expectations are likely to be in focus , and Bernanke 's much anticipated speech is likely to play a pivotal role for near-term price direction across all asset classes , '' said Gain Capital Forex.com analyst Daniel Hwang . \nThe previous round of quantitative easing announced a year ago has led to a sharp boost in commodity prices but has failed to revive growth of the world 's largest economy . \nIn the euro zone , the latest data from economic powerhouse Germany showed a steep drop in business confidence and worries about the fiscal troubles ripping through the common currency area . \n`` The month of August has seen one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the outlook for the global economy in living memory . \nContinued political squabbling , combined with poor historical economic data released around the turn of the month , led to a dramatic collapse in financial market sentiment , with many risk assets experiencing the largest falls since the period immediately following the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 , '' Credit Suisse analysts said . \nAnalyst Davide Tabarelli from Nomisma Energy expected oil prices to shed a political risk premium gained on the back of the Libyan conflict . \n`` Prices increased by $ 20 because of Libya ; now they should fall by at least that portion , '' Tabarelli said , adding it could take around three months to bring production in line with previous levels . \nBut Tabarelli was in the minority . \nFour out of five analysts in the Reuters poll still saw 2012 Brent prices above $ 100 . \n`` With the resumption of supplies from Libya , the oil price could come under pressure in the coming months , though it is unlikely to fall below $ 100 per barrel for long , '' Commerzbank analysts said in a note . \nThe fall in prices should also help tighten the gap between Brent and U.S. light crude prices to an average of $ 11.60 per barrel in 2012 from around $ 24.90 a barrel currently . \nDespite an expected correction of feedstock prices , Petromatrix 's Jakob warned that product prices remained at high levels that are hampering demand , and the trickle of downward revisions to oil demand projections was underway . \nThe latest available data from MasterCard showed U.S. retail gasoline demand fell last week despite a drop in pump prices , in what analysts warned had been a difficult driving season . \n-LRB- Reporting by Zaida Espana ; Polling by Bangalore Unit ; Editing by -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nWhile many African states have recognized the NTC , the AU would not do so as long as fighting continued , South African President Jacob Zuma , a vocal advocate for Gaddafi , said after a meeting in Addis Ababa at which the AU called for all sides in the conflict to negotiate a peace and work for democracy . \n`` If there is fighting , there is fighting , '' Zuma said . \n`` The process is fluid . \nThat 's part of what we inform countries -- whether there is an authority to recognize . '' \nRebel leaders are determined to show they are in charge , though estimates vary of when the TNC will move formally from its Benghazi base in the east to the war zone that is Tripoli . \n`` We have come to operate the country . \nWe are now the legal authority , '' declared Mohammed al-Alagi , a lawyer who has been the TNC 's justice minister for some months , as he met foreign journalists in the capital wearing a rebel flag as a bandana . \nOther TNC leaders , who stress they want to work with other rebel groups which sprang up later in the west as well with those who have previously supported Gaddafi , say the war will only be over once the fallen leader is caught , `` dead or alive . '' \nAlagi voiced confidence that Gaddafi and his entourage of sons and aides was surrounded and would soon be captured : `` The area where he is now is under siege , '' he told Reuters , while declining to say where in Tripoli he thought Gaddafi was . \n`` The rebels are monitoring the area and they are dealing with it . '' \nSimilar confidence has proved misplaced since the irregular armies overran Gaddafi 's compound on Tuesday , however , and analysts do not rule out that the 69-year-old , a veteran master of surprise , might have slipped away to rally supporters for an insurgency . \nHe has not been seen in public for two months , but made a defiant audio broadcast on Thursday . \nColonel Hisham Buhagiar of the rebel force in the capital said Libyan commandos were targeting several areas : `` We are sending special forces every day to hunt down Gaddafi . \nWe have one unit that does intelligence and other units that hunt him . '' \nNATO forces , notably from France and Britain , are helping the rebels . \nMany analysts assume they are giving intelligence and may have their own special forces troops on the ground . \nDespite sporadic gunfire as rebel fighters tried to take pockets of loyalist resistance , Tripoli was quieter than in recent days . \nDead bodies , the stench of rotting garbage in the oppressive summer heat , wrecked cars and the other detritus of war were evidence of frantic battles and wildly erratic firing . \nSome of Tripoli 's two million people , suffering from power cuts , dwindling supplies and a critical shortage of medical supplies and healthcare , ventured out to local mosques , some praying Gaddafi can be found by Monday , when Muslims mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid . \n`` Gaddafi is the biggest criminal and dictator and we hope we will find him before the end of Ramadan , '' said Milad Abu Aisha , a 60-year-old pensioner who joined friends at his local mosque for traditional worship on the last Friday of Ramadan . \n`` It will be the happiest Eid in 42 years , '' said Mohammed al-Misrati , a 52-year-old office worker who was among hundreds streaming toward the mosque under the protection of armed local men who have formed ad hoc security units across the capital . \n`` We have a taste of freedom after 42 years of repression . '' \nBritish aircraft fired cruise missiles at a headquarters bunker overnight in Gaddafi 's birthplace of Sirte . \nA city beyond rebel control , on the Mediterranean coast 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , some believe he might seek refuge there among his tribesmen . \nLoyalist forces also still hold positions deep in the Sahara desert . \n`` Sirte remains an operating base from which pro-Gaddafi troops project hostile forces against Misrata and Tripoli , '' a NATO official said , adding that its forces had also acted to stop a column of 29 vehicles heading west toward Misrata . \nIn Benghazi , rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the bombing in Sirte was aimed at ammunition stores and depots for Scud missiles . \n`` Maybe the mercenaries will run away , '' he said , referring to suggestions Gaddafi 's forces include hired fighters from Chad and other sub-Saharan African countries . \n`` After this bombing , maybe the people there will try to rise up . '' \nhe added , saying TNC commanders were also in contact with tribal chiefs in Sirte , hoping to avoid bloodshed . \nSuch negotiations will be a major challenge across the country for Libya 's new rulers as they try to meet expectations of young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war . \n-LRB- Reporting by Peter Graff , Ulf Laessing , Mohammed Abbas , and Samia Nakhoul in Tripoli ; Robert Birsel , Emma Farge and Alexander Dziadosz in Benghazi , Barry Malone in Addis Ababa , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Marie-Louise Gumuchian in Algiers , Giles Elgood , Christian Lowe , Tarek Amara and Richard Valdmanis in Tunis , ; Ibon Villelabeitia in Ankara , Jon Hemming in London , Arshad Mohammed in Washington and Justyna Pawlak in Brussels ; Writing by Alastair Macdonald -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOne prayer answered ; a million more to go -- and those are just mine . \nI just ca n't help thinking about the level of weapons attrition we 're creating in that area . \nLosing so many weapons leaves that vicinity open to foreign invaders from their north or northeast . \nWe should be seriously be reconsidering our tactical resources and approach in that theater . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "261", "time": "2011-10-12", "text": "Were NATO strikes on Gaddafi s home town justified ? \nNATO has been extraordinarily careful in target selection . \nNATO has been very careful to minimize civilian casualties . \nNATO has stayed within its mandate throughout . \nIt s a mantra that NATO , and the countries that have contributed to its Libyan adventure , have had to learn well . \nThey ve been accused of stretching the legality of the mission to protect civilians by all necessary measures before . \nBut the problem with sticking to a script , is that the Libyan conflict hasn t really progressed with any sort of predictable narrative since the fall of Tripoli on the night of August 23rd . \nIf the then rebels of the now ruling National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- expected that internal insurrections would help them and they d race into Gaddafi s hometown of Sirte and the other remaining holdout , Bani Walid , to a hero s welcome , they were mistaken . \nSirte and Bani Walid were not Tripoli . \nThey resisted -- and resisted ferociously . \nTaken aback , fighters loyal to the NTC began drawn-out sieges of both towns , battering them with rockets , mortars and tanks as Gaddafi loyalists hit them with intense sniper and rocket fire . \nAnd all the while , the NTC men were backed by NATO warplanes . \nNow it s not only the usual critics saying that NATO has overstepped the mark . \nIt s terrified Libyans fleeing Sirte with tales of dead relatives , weeks of little food and houses demolished by rockets . \n`` What did America and NATO bring to us ? \nDid they bring apricots ? '' \none man shouted at a Reuters journalist in Sirte last week . \n`` No , they brought us the shelling and the strikes . \nThey terrorised our kids . \nIt s war , some officials say privately . \nIt s always messy towards the end . \nBut civilian deaths have been kept to a minimum and the country s infrastructure has been left largely intact , giving the economy a chance to get moving quickly . \nThey could have surrendered , NTC commanders point out . \nNATO says that remnants of the Gaddafi regime pose a threat to civilians and it will support NTC operations for as long as that threat remains . \nThey say Gaddafi loyalists in Sirte had kept people there as human shields and executed anti-Gaddafi residents stories echoed by some fleeing the city . \nFor NATO s detractors , it s hard to see how launching airstrikes on a city already under heavy shelling from the NTC and with no power and little food amounted to protecting the people who lived in it . \nLiam Fox was sure where the blame for the suffering lay . \nThere wouldn t be any NATO strikes if it had not been for the fact that Gaddafi was threatening his own population and threatening a civilian , humanitarian catastrophe in Benghazi , '' he told me , adding that the people of Sirte may need to be given some information on why the siege played out as it did . \nThe risk now is that a people embittered by weeks of misery and the deaths of their friends may turn on the young government , making it difficult to stabilise the country and get it properly running again . \nAlso , it seems true that many of them are sorry to see Gaddafi go some because of tribal allegiances , some because their city benefitted from his position and some simply because they admired him . \nOne loyalist captured at the hospital in Sirte kept a photo of the ousted leader in his pocket . \nFor NATO , the worst-case scenario risks turning an operation it heralds a success , into an embarrassment . \nIt was more than I expected , I heard Fox say to his NTC hosts over lunch in Misrata , referring to the wreckage wrought by Gaddafi s merciless bombardment of that city after it was taken by the NTC . \nThe pictures emerging from Sirte as it enters endgame suggest its devastation will be similar . \nWhat that will mean is the question . \nNo , NATO 's strikes were not justified . \nNATO violated its own mission to protect civilians when it took sides : some civilians were worth protecting , others such as Gaddafi supporters were bombed . \nThere are plenty of anecdotal reports from Sirte about the adverse consequences of NATO 's bombing for civilians . \nMoreover , NATO should have remained impartial rather than taken sides . \nIt 's support for the rebels translates into support for the rebels ' documented war crimes against black Africans , including fellow Libyans , and suspected `` loyalists '' . \nEurope and the US have betrayed all principle in their greed for oil . \nMy heart goes out to those who have had to pay the price , like the 3 year old in the bombed and shelled Sirte hospital with two broken legs and a damaged eye . \nI had thought that Europeans had given up war as a means to solve conflicts ; looks like they have not given up war when it is waged against the countries of the South . \nNATO should be prosecuted for the war crimes it has committed as should the so called rebels it used as on the ground proxies for European soldiers . \nThis is not an `` embarrassment '' ; it is carnage and destruction of infrastructure , people 's houses , hospitals , schools ; NATO should foot the bill for reconstruction and pay reparations to those families affected . \nRight now its priority should be getting black Africans out of jail and making sure that prisoners are not being tortured , raped , abused , dehumanized . \nThe NATO mission in Libya makes a mockery of the `` civilization '' that the heirs of the Enlightenment claim to represent . \nThe civilized do not maim , hurt , kill small children . \nDear Mr. Malone : thanks for posting this story . \nThere is little in the press on this topic . \nI am sure that Mr Liam Fox would love to see his own house pulverised as long `` it is justified . '' \nEqually , smart media fabrications have also concluded that the Bombing of London , Desden , Nagasaki and Hiroshima `` had been justified ' because `` it had saved lives '' . \nNATO 's intervention in Libya is without a doubt a fiasco . \nNo one understands how this military alliance meant to defend Europe against Soviets came to mingle into Libyan internal affairs . \nHey , why do n't we send NATO forces to to Mexico to fight the war on drugs -- a trade we defend in Afghanistan ? \nHas NATO has stayed within its mandate ? \nNATO has no mandate . \nNATO was n't mentioned in UNSC R 1970 or 1973 . \nThe entire war has been fashioned out of thin air , with considerable assistance from mainstream media including Reuters . \nIt 's illegal , murderous and utterly evil . \nParticipation in this unprovoked act of aggression against a sovereign nation is a war crime if the term has any meaning any more . \nWhats going on there is completely a mockery of NATO 's mandate shelling a city indiscriminately like we are seeing NTC & NATO do is immoral and borders on crimes against humanity ... looking at sirte the city is ruin for a month now the siege has yet to bear any fruits the humanitarian crisis is at its peak how is NATO protecting civilian if they are contributing to the mass killing of Gaddafi supporters . \nsomeone said when hunting for a beast be very careful not to turn into one . . \nI think in this case its too late . \nthe NATO bombings were absolutely justified . \nYes it is a tragedy for the people whose houses are being bombed because they harbor pro-gaddafi fighters but that is the nature of war . \nDoes n't anyone recall when gaddafi shot and killed hundreds of protesters just because they were protesting ? \ni bet the people who were getting shot at then are pretty damn glad that NATO intervened . \nNATO has been hitting military targets . \nthere are no huge dumb bombs being dropped all over cities , just precision airstrikes . \nin my opinion its better to get this whole ugly war business over as quickly as possible . \nwithout NATO assistance , there would be a long drawn out civil war . \nRemember the American civil war ? \ni bet if France or England or someone had helped out one side then thousands and thousands of lives could have been saved . \nI guess the main point is that people is a necessary evil of war , its a dirty business , all that can be done is to minimize the carnage . \nThe Libyan people do n't want to kill civilians as much if not more than we -LRB- NATO -RRB- does . \nEventually everyone has to be reintegrated under whatever regime pops us at the end of this mess . \nObviously we 're sitting on the wrong side of the fence . \nNATO is a pawn of U.S. and west , consequently U.N. was useless in trying to tie their hands . \nWith over 50,000 casualties and total devastation of some cities , did NATO really `` protect '' civilians or protect NTC rebels who were a ` rag-tag '' army that could n't stand vs Gaddaffi 's troops . \nOil is the name of the game an d Western allies will be lining up for reconstruction projects paid for in `` black gold . '' \nNeat world we live in , eh ? \nPosted by tod | Report as abusive I just do n't understand how these rebels have some of the updated weapons in their hands when these political leaders are crying out loud that they are fighting the terrorism . \nJust like in Irak , this end will be very sad ... NATO is always looking for a fight , and Libya episode is a shame to the western uncivilized attitude . \nThis will hunt them for generation to come . \nMust have been an incredibly slow news day . \nAsk the same questions for months . \nGet the same answers . \nTry and make that a story . \nNato in Libya equals oil for Nato countries and their war planes . \nNo oil in Zimbawia so Mugabee you are safe . \nNice one Nato this means I can still fuel my gas guzzling SUV brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrum . \nWhat country can we topple nest for oil as Libyas wont last for ever . \nIm serious , at least I speak the truth ! \nLets cut all the nonsense of NATO mission to protect civilians . \nThis was NATO 's mission to assassinate Gadaffi and thats exactly what they did plain and simple . \nMuammar al-Qaddhafi was a murderer and a pillager . \nAs such , he -- and all who helped him -LRB- actively and passively -RRB- -- were fair game . \nAl-Qaddhafi viewed other Libyans as his `` property '' , with whom he could do as he pleased . \nAl-Qaddhafi chose to `` hole up '' in Sirte , rather than to surrender . \nHe could have taken refuge at a military base , where civilians would not be at risk from the inevitable shoot-out . \nWhile some in Sirte likely did not back al-Qaddhafi , the destruction they suffered will be a long-lasting lesson . \nThose , who do not stand up to a dictator , may be swept away with him . \nThe horrendous destruction inflicted on Germany during World War II , to this moves Germans to reject political extremists . \nIndeed , a specific unit of the German government -- the Bundesamtes f r Verfassungsschutz -LRB- Federal Office for Protection of the Constitution -RRB- -- watches all extremists carefully . \nThose , who defend al-Qaddhafi -- or criticise NATO for having helped Libyans to oust him -- embrace al-Qaddhafi 's approach : murder and pillage . \nLibyans will benefit from his decision to fight to the end . \nThat fight thinned the ranks of democracy-haters . \nHad al-Qaddhafi surrendered quietly , thousands of his henchmen would have survived , to poison Libya for many more years . \nFurther , during their months-long fight for freedom , many Libyans acquired skills with firearms , e.g. , battle rifles , pistols , shotguns , etc. . \nI pray they 'll be smart enough not to surrender these to anyone . \nWhile explosives -LRB- artillery shells , grenades , missiles , etc. -RRB- are dangerous , especially if stored badly , firearms -- if securely stored -- are quite safe . \nBecause Libyans lacked weapons and the skills to use them , they had to have help to oust al-Qaddhafi and his accomplices . \nIf Libyans are to remain free , they must remain armed . \nThose , who urge Libyans to disarm , simply can not grasp that dictators flourish , when their victims are disarmed . \nAs to Mugabe , South Africa should deal with him . \nIt bespeaks South Africa 's insensitivity to Zimbabweans ' sufferings , that they have not ousted Mugabe . \nIt is ironic , that South Africans , who got much foreign help to free themselves from Apartheid tyrants , will not reach out to help neighbors , who groan under Mugabe 's pillaging . \nThose , who provide that , deserve our praise , for they liberate the oppressed . \n`` Were NATO strikes on Gaddafi s home town justified ? '' \nUnless Sirte was prepared to be starved into submission to protect Gadaffi 's miserable skin , and the moralisers willing to watch . \nThe revolutionary forces pleaded on behalf of the residents of Sirte with Gadaffi 's frontmen for months , but they made almost no concessions to the general welfare . \nGadaffi 's neck was more valuable . \nAfter that , the sooner it ended the more lives were saved . \nAs for the bombing itself , the details are far from clear . \nMuch o9f the so-called ` residential ' areas struck were in fact either evacuated or not even finished . \nAnd the attack on Sima hospital is a legal minefield for Gadaffi aplogists , since his forces were installed within , making it a military target . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI have also worked for Reuters in Tunisia , Iraq and Libya and was part of the team that dominated coverage of Muammar Gaddafi 's killing . \nAlways welcome a good chat over on Twitter : @malonebarry \n"}
{"id": "242", "time": "2011-10-12", "text": "TRIPOLI | Wed Oct 12 , 2011 10:00 am EDT TRIPOLI Oct 12 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A holiday in Libya may sound like an absurdity now , but many of the country 's tour operators and officials are already starting to predict a bright future for the travel industry once the dust of war settles . \nThe coastal country has all the makings for a vibrant tourism business , they say : warm weather , beaches , antiquities and proximity to Europe -- all factors that helped the industry thrive in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia . \nIf developed , tourism could eventually help dent Libya 's high jobless rate by creating work for tour guides , drivers , restaurant workers and hotel staff , as well as help it diversify its economy away from dependency on oil and gas . \nThe fact that operators are thinking about resuming business at all -- some predicted tourists would start arriving again within a year -- testifies to the relative peace that has prevailed in Tripoli and other parts of Libya since the former rebels ousted Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from the capital in August . \nOne company , Sherwes Travel , already advertises a three-day , 295-euro tour of `` post-war Libya '' on its website , featuring visits to sites in Tripoli and to the Roman ruins of Leptis Magna . \nEmployees admit it may be a bit optimistic . \n`` The tour was very popular , actually . \nBut not now , not yet , '' said Ibrahim Usta , the company 's self-described international customer assistant . \nHe said while some potential visitors had been in touch , it was not yet possible to bring them to Libya . \n`` We have many inquiries right now , but the problem is mainly security and visas , '' he said . \n`` There 's no -LRB- visa -RRB- system in place and many embassies are not functioning . '' \nUsta and others said tourism was languishing before the revolt because of apathy , incompetence , complex visa requirements , draconian police oversight and mercurial regulations under Gaddafi 's government . \nSabri Ellotai , manager of Sabri Tours and Travel , described bringing a group of Germans in 2009 only to have them turned away at the airport because they did not have an Arabic translation for their passports -- a requirement he had never heard of before . \n`` I heard about it -LRB- the law -RRB- at the airport , '' Ellotai said , shaking his head . \nHe and others said they hoped the country 's new rulers -- currently represented by the interim National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- -- would be able to do more with the industry when the war is over . \nNTC forces are still fighting to take over Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production . \nLibya 's lucrative oil and gas industry made tourism less of a priority than in Egypt and Tunisia , where it was a major contributor of jobs and foreign revenues before the uprisings in those countries . \nLibyan central bank official Ali Shnebesh estimated tourism could account for between 3 and 4 percent of the economy within five to ten years , depending on how much effort the country 's new government puts into it . \n`` It would decrease unemployment , since we have a lot of areas that are good for tourism , '' he said . \n`` It would put thousands of our people to work in these places in many sectors -- telecommunications , transportation , hotels -- everywhere . '' \nIt is difficult to tell how much tourism contributed to Libya 's economy before the revolt because it was not tracked as a separate industry in central bank records , but Shnebesh estimated it was below half a percent of gross domestic product . \nThat compares to Egypt , for instance , where officials said it accounted for over 11 percent before the revolt . \nThere is plenty of evidence of the lax oversight at the ancient Greek colony of Cyrene , which was featured in the chronicler Herodotus 's `` The Histories '' and is now a UNESCO world heritage site , in the eastern Jebel al-Akhdar region . \nThe site is overgrown with weeds and graffiti etched onto one of its old columns . \nA renovation crew of Italians , Americans and French fled after the uprising started , guards there said . \nJamal Salem , 50 , sitting in the afternoon sun outside a souvenir shop filled with woven baskets , photographs and ceramic statues still on display , said there were n't many visitors even before the revolt . \n`` A lot of people think Libyans are terrorists , and so they 're afraid of coming here , '' he said . \n`` We hope the picture will become clearer now , and that things will get better . '' \nOthers lingering in the area of Cyrene said they also hoped the revolt would help stamp out what they saw as widespread corruption and regional favouritism in the industry . \n`` Before , companies had their headquarters in Tripoli . \nThey brought the cars from Tripoli , they brought the translators from Tripoli , everything . \nNobody here benefited from it at all , '' Hussein Saleh , who volunteered to help guard Cyrene , said . \nOthers near Cyrene and other sites said they also hoped a new government would show more interest in preserving relics . \n`` We 're expecting a better future , and maybe more interest in renovating the antiquities , '' said Muftah Mabrook , a 35-year-old researcher at the ancient Greek port of Apollonia , a picturesque collection of columns and other ruins set against the sea . \nWhile such ambitions are running high , it 's too soon to say how the situation will turn out . \nTripoli 's atmospheric old city is slowly coming back to life as jewelry shops and cafes reopen up in its winding streets , for instance , but many alleys are still littered with bullet casings . \nIn some areas , young men with Kalashnikov assault rifles sit smoking and chatting on stoops or around street corners . \nThey are friendly , for the most part , as they smile and wave at foreign passersby , but their presence is not likely to encourage most holidaymakers . \nThe relative lack of English and French language speakers , as well as the ban on alcohol , may also make it hard for Libya to compete on a large scale with Egypt and Tunisia even after the war is finished , some operators say . \nBut Usta , like many others , was confident the industry would eventually thrive . \n`` We have everything . \nWe have the desert , we have the sea , we have mountains . \nWe just need the right people in the right place .

{"id": "278", "time": "2011-08-21", "text": "LONDON | Sun Aug 21 , 2011 12:37 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebel forces ill-equipped to fight their way into a city the size of Tripoli may look to locally brokered deals or a burgeoning popular uprising to break the will of Muammar Gaddafi 's forces . \nLibya 's civil war so far has involved some serious urban fighting in towns such as Misrata , but most battles have been relatively small skirmishes . \nIf Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi retains the loyalty of large numbers of security forces in the capital , the ragtag opposition forces could struggle and there would be little NATO air strikes could do without risking civilians . \n`` I 'm assuming the Tripoli fighting could be the fiercest , '' said Hayat Alvi , lecturer in Middle East politics at the United States Naval War College . \n`` The wild card will be the Tripoli public . \nTrue loyalties will have to finally manifest themselves . \nI 'm predicting in the rebels ' favor , but we do n't know what Gaddafi and his sons have up their sleeves . '' \nGauging the loyalty of Tripoli 's population is far from easy . \nGaddafi loyalists have put on many marches and demonstrations of loyalty in recent months , but hundreds if not thousands of his opponents also took to the streets in the early stages of the uprising before they were cowed . \nThe rebels will hope security forces will melt away . \nSome say Gaddafi himself might already have fled , perhaps to his hometown of Sirte or a desert base further south . \nThe long speeches at boisterous public meetings have given way to broadcast addresses delivered on scratchy telephone lines . \nBut others say the nascent uprising reported in Tripoli on Saturday night might have come too soon , with opposition forces still too far away to help . \nDespite rhetoric of taking Tripoli and ending the war in hours or days , some analysts suspect it is more likely the rebels will cement their stranglehold on the city and then see how events play out . \n`` I think they 'll wait on the outskirts and hope for either an uprising or that Gaddafi decided to call it a day and leaves , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst for IHS Jane 's . \n`` If they do go in , they could find it very difficult and they will be keen to avoid that . \nIt 's relatively obvious that NATO has been providing close air support for the rebels . \n`` That 's one thing in open countryside or lightly populated areas -- although it pushes the Security Council mandate , to put it mildly -- but it would be almost impossible in Tripoli . '' \nGaddafi 's government seems keen to broker some kind of last-minute ceasefire that would keep them in power . \nBut few believe either the rebels or NATO would agree to that at this stage . \nIn Paris , a diplomatic source said rebel cells undercover in Tripoli were putting into action plans prepared months ago . \nHe said , however , the rebels were under orders not to enact revenge killings or summary executions against senior members of Gaddafi 's camp . \nSaad Djebbar , a former lawyer for the Libyan government , told Reuters he believed many key figures loyal to Gaddafi had already fled to other countries in Africa such as Niger , Mali and Chad where they had good contacts . \n`` The big sharks have already left the scene , he said . \n`` It 's not going to be Stalingrad . \nTripoli is very small . \nPeople know each other . \nPeople negotiate their way forward . \nGaddafi is bound to have some people who will put up a symbolic fight . \nBut these are mostly thugs and there is no organized force left of any size to check the rebels . '' \nIf the rebels are wrong and significant Gaddafi forces remain , strategists say they could be in serious trouble . \nUrban warfare is notoriously challenging and bloody , giving a clear advantage to the defender , while some doubt the opposition have sufficient supply lines to sustain an offensive . \n`` The costliness of urban fighting can not be overestimated , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor in a note . \n`` Such warfare requires a well-trained force with high morale , and the rebel forces in the west are known to be few in number ... and extremely ill-trained . '' \nThe key battle now , Stratfor said , was psychological -- with the rebel agenda to paint a picture of inevitable victory that would enthuse new uprisings and prompt Gaddafi loyalists to abandon their cause to save their necks . \nMuch , of course , will depend on how Gaddafi himself chooses to play the endgame . \nHe could still perhaps go into either internal or external exile or simply try to copy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disappear into the post-war chaos . \nSaddam evaded U.S. forces for months following the 2003 fall of Baghdad before they eventually tracked him down -- although most analysts believe such a scheme would prove tougher in Libya because of its more disparate geography . \nEven if opposition forces were able to take much of Tripoli relatively easily and bloodlessly , they might still struggle to take down the final remnants of the regime . \nThen , the situation could resemble that seen earlier this year in Ivory Coast , where opposition fighters loyal to Alassane Ouattara took much of the capital Abidjan but seemed unable to capture incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo . \nIt took the actions of French helicopter gunships and troops already based in the country to eventually breach his compound and bunker , allowing his capture by local forces . \nThe International Criminal Court in The Hague indicted Gadaffi , his eldest son and spy chief for crimes committed during their initial crackdown . \nThat might yet prompt foreign military action to help the rebels capture him . \n`` I would have thought NATO would be very keen let the rebels get Gaddafi themselves as they possibly can , '' said IHS Jane 's Hartwell . \n`` But if it really came down to getting him out of a hole , you could see some Western involvement as we did in Abidjan . \nThe ICC warrant could make it justifiable in that context . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey can simply cut off Tripoli from gasoline and electricity and wait . \nThere seems to be enthusiasm in western media for the regime 's collapse , and this irrationally translates proximity of rebel forces to Tripoli into their imminent success . \nThe regime seems poised to fall , but it wo n't come from gun-toting , untrained , western-backed rebels on the capitol 's fringes . \nThe regime will fall when there is a mass popular uprising in the city , and when deals have been struck between high-level military leaders and -LRB- mostly external -RRB- parties that have an interest in the regime 's collapse . \nNo patriot can give up a throne without a strong fight . \nNATO 's approach was lopsided and propelled a rebel group to try and take over so that NATO has puppets in power . \nGreed , barbarism led NATO to twist the UN mandate . \nThe leaders in NATO countries could not allow for a better solution , they seem to have no regard for casualties of African or third world countries as long as the strategic interest of the west and achieved . \nNATO must let Libyans settle there own problems without ludicrous foreign interference with bombs . \nUN needs to stop this war now , if it really has any worth as a world and not a club for the western countries This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nGaddafi , a colorful and often brutal autocrat who has ruled Libya for over 40 years , said he was breaking out weapons stores to arm the population . \nHis spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , predicted a violent reckoning by the rebels . \n`` A massacre will be committed inside Tripoli if one side wins now , because the rebels have come with such hatred , such vendetta ... Even if the leader leaves or steps down now , there will be a massacre . '' \nNATO , which has backed the rebels with a bombing campaign , said the transition of power in Libya must be peaceful . \nAfter a six-month civil war , the fall of Tripoli came quickly , with a carefully orchestrated uprising launched on Saturday night to coincide with the advance of rebel troops on three fronts . \nFighting broke out after the call to prayer from the minarets of the mosques . \nRebel National Transitional Council Coordinator Adel Dabbechi confirmed that Gaddafi 's younger son Saif Al-Islam had been captured . \nHis eldest son Mohammed Al-Gaddafi had surrendered to rebel forces , he told Reuters . \nOnly five months ago Gaddafi 's forces were set to crush the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , the leader warning in a television address that there would be `` no mercy , no pity '' for his opponents . \nHis forces , he said , would hunt them down `` district to district , street to street , house to house , room to room . '' \nThe United Nations then acted quickly , clearing the way for creation of a no-fly zone that NATO , with a campaign of bombing , used ultimately to help drive back Gaddafi 's forces . \n`` It 's over . \nGaddafi 's finished , '' said Saad Djebbar , former legal adviser to Libyan government . \nAl Jazeera television aired images of people celebrating in central Tripoli and tearing down posters of Gaddafi , which had dominated Libyan cities for decades . \nIn Benghazi in the east , thousands gathered in a city-center square waving red , black and green opposition flag as news filtered through of rebel advances into Tripoli . \n`` It 's over ! '' \nshouted one man as he dashed out of a building , a mobile telephone clutched to his ear . \nCelebratory gunfire and explosions rang out over the city and cars blaring their horns crowded onto the streets . \nOverhead , red tracer bullets darted into a black sky . \n`` It does look like it is coming to an end , '' said Anthony Skinner , Middle East analyst , Maplecroft . \n`` But there are still plenty of questions . \nThe most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . \nDoes he flee or can he fight ? '' \n`` In the slightly longer term , what happens next ? \nWe know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front to run the country .

'' \n`` The rebels will want to get rid of every last vestige of the regime but I know of no effective plan or operation so far to rebuild the country . '' \nJOHN DRAKE , SENIOR RISK CONSULTANT , UK-BASED CONSULTANCY AKE `` Had the rebels marched into Tripoli in late February the situation would have been very different and the city may have fallen relatively quickly and easily . \n`` Now , after six months of fighting , the animosity between the two sides is likely to be a lot higher , so there is going to be a risk of violent retribution against those seen as having supported the regime over that time . '' \nASHOUR SHAMIS , OPPOSITION ACTIVIST AND JOURNALIST `` The game is over for Gaddafi . \nThere 's bound to be some resistance here and there but his forces seem to be falling apart . \nHe no longer directs his men . \n`` I think most Libyans want his men to peacefully surrender but if they resist they will have to be fought . \n`` If rebel forces capture people who are wanted by The Hague court , they will have to keep them safe until they are handed over to Libyan legal authorities . \n`` What then happens to those persons arrested , in terms of whether they end up at The Hague court , will I think depend in part on how they conduct themselves -LRB- in custody -RRB- . '' \nANTHONY SKINNER , MIDDLE EAST ANALYST , MAPLECROFT `` It does look like it is coming to an end . \nBut there are still plenty of questions . \nThe most important is exactly what Gaddafi does now . \nDoes he flee or can he fight ? \nIn the slightly longer term , what happens next ? \nWe know there have been some serious divisions between the rebel movement and we do n't know yet if they will be able to form a cohesive front is to run the country . \n`` Looking further afield , it is obviously going to be very uncomfortable viewing for Assad in Syria . \nObviously they are very different cases , particularly because of the outside military involvement in Libya . \nBut it 's another sign that when you use brutal force against protesters , you lose legitimacy . \nIt just inflames the situation and at the end of the day we have seen another regional leader forced from power . '' \nDANIEL KORSKI , SENIOR FELLOW , EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS `` The next few hours are key . \nFrom Iraq we know that the first days , weeks and months are key for any long-term stability . \nWhat happens to law and order , what happens to ex-loyalists is key . \nThe worst that could happen is the collapse of the Gaddafi regime and a huge vacuum . \nThe West must be there to support an orderly transition , resist crowing and taking the responsibility away from the Libyans yet make clear to the rebels they must hold to standards they felt Gaddafi never met .

'' \nsaid Mohammed , who comes from Sudan 's troubled Darfur region . \nHe left years ago for Libya to escape violence at home . \nThe United Nations says almost 900,000 people , including 200,000 foreign workers , have fled Libya into Tunisia to escape fighting after rebels launched an uprising against the 41-year-rule of Muammar Gaddafi in February . \nAfrican workers in particular were frequently targeted by Gaddafi 's opponents , who sometimes accused them of working for the government as mercenaries . \nMost of the Libyans have gone back home or have found new places to stay , and most of the foreigners have been sent home to their countries of origin . \nBut around 4,000 of the foreigners , like Mohammed , can not go home because of war or danger in their own countries , and have remained for months in this camp near the border , stateless and unsure of their future . \nIn March , Mohammed made his way to Ras Jidr , the main gateway between Libya and Tunisia . \nHe has been staying in a tent city just behind the border post . \n`` I came with my family to Libya because life in Darfur was bad . \nIt 's still bad there . \nThere is no stability , '' he said , sitting on a mat with fellow Sudanese refugees . \nMore than two million people have left their homes in Darfur after the government started a campaign against non-Arab rebels there . \nFighting has ebbed from peak levels but there is no end to the conflict in the region , which borders eastern Libya . \nWith the help of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR , Mohammed has filed a request for asylum . \nSo far few Western countries have signalled a willingness to accept stranded Africans from the border camps , U.N. officials say . \n`` We are conducting interviews on an individual case basis and trying to speed up the process but it takes time , '' said Rocco Nuri , a spokesman for UNHCR in Tunisia . \nMany others in the camp share the same fate , sitting in front of their white tents or under trees by the main road to the border . \n`` I came to Benghazi to study but I do n't know what to do now , '' said another young Sudanese man from South Kordofan , a region which has seen fighting recently between the army and fighters allied to newly-independent South Sudan . \nThe early days of the conflict in Libya saw chaos at the border and a massive effort to prevent humanitarian disaster . \nThe camps in Tunisia were overcrowded at the start , with fights breaking out between refugees waiting for hours for food or water . \nTensions ran high between refugees from areas at conflict with each other , such as Sudanese from Darfur and the capital Khartoum . \nSome governments such as Egypt sent planes to fetch their stranded citizens . \nHalf a million Libyans returned home , according to the UNHCR . \nThe rest have largely scattered . \nThe 4,000 Africans who remain , segregated by nationalities , live in tents exposed to the sun in the open plain . \n`` The location is unfortunate because it is close to the border and very hot , '' said Nuri . \nMost have applied for asylum in Western countries . \nSome have no money to go home or no plan of where to go . \n`` I came to Libya in 1990 to work first as a factory worker and have done several other jobs since then , '' said Omar from Ivory Coast . \n`` I do n't know what to do now , '' he said , before heading to his tent . \nWhile he enjoyed living and making good money in Libya , he said going back to Libya is not an option . \n`` It got impossible to stay in Libya , not just because of the security but the attacks against black people , '' he said . \nAbdulrahman , also from Darfur , said he had been accused by both Gaddafi supporters and rebels of fighting for the other side . \n`` We 're in the middle of accusations from both sides .

{"id": "123", "time": "2011-08-28", "text": "TRIPOLI | Sun Aug 28 , 2011 7:37 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebel forces were converging on Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte on Monday , hoping to deliver the coup de grace of their revolution but uncertain if the fallen strongman was holed up there . \nThe fugitive Gaddafi 's exact whereabouts where still not known and it was possible he was still in hiding in Tripoli , five days after it fell to rebel forces and his 42-year-old reign collapsed . \nNATO war planes struck at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , for a third day on Sunday , a spokesman for the multi-national alliance said in Brussels . \n`` We 're paying close attention to what 's happening in Sirte because we know that there are remnants of the regime that are there , '' the spokesman said . \nOn the ground , rebel forces also closed in and said they would seize Sirte by force if negotiations for its surrender failed . \nGaddafi was born near Sirte , 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , in 1942 and after he seized power in 1969 he built it up from a sleepy fishing village into an important city and power center of 100,000 people . \nHe still retains support and sympathy there , so whether or not he has chosen to retreat to the city to make a last stand , its capture will still be strategically and symbolically important to the rebels as they consolidate their victory . \nOne rebel commander said his forces were within 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- of Sirte from the east and others were advancing from the west . \nOn the coastal highway east of Tripoli , tank transporters were carrying Soviet-designed T-55 tanks in the direction of Sirte . \nRebels said the tanks were seized from an abandoned military base in Zlitan . \nJamal Tunally , a rebel military commander in Misrata , told Reuters : `` The front line is 30 km from Sirte . \nWe think the Sirte situation will be resolved peacefully , God willing . '' \n`` Now we just need to find Gaddafi . \nI think he is still hiding underneath Bab al-Aziziyah like a rat , '' said Tunally , referring to Gaddafi 's compound in Tripoli which rebels overran on Tuesday . \nIn the east , rebel fighters pushed 7 km -LRB- 4 miles -RRB- past the village of Bin Jawad and secured the Nawfaliyah junction , a rebel spokesman said . \n`` We 're going slowly , '' spokesman Mohammad Zawawi told Reuters . \n`` We want to give more time for negotiations , to give a chance for those people trying to persuade the people inside Sirte to surrender and open their city . '' \nIn Tripoli , the rebel leadership sought to establish control after days of confusion and sporadic skirmishing with the remnants of Gaddafi 's forces . \nSeveral explosions and intermittent gunfire were heard overnight Sunday . \nThe stench of rotting bodies and burning garbage still hung over the city and food , water and other supplies were running short , indications that despite the euphoria of victory , plenty of challenges lay ahead . \nGaddafi , 69 , is on the run and the fear among his foes is that he intends to lead an insurgency against them . \nNTC officials rejected any idea of talks with him , saying he was a criminal who must be brought to justice . \n`` We did not negotiate when we were weak , and we wo n't negotiate now that we have liberated all of Libya , '' NTC information minister Mahmoud Shammam told a news conference . \nThe Associated Press earlier quoted Gaddafi 's spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , as saying Gaddafi was still in Libya and wanted to discuss forming a transitional government with the NTC . \nNTC officials say Gaddafi , his son Saif al-Islam and his spy chief should be tried in Libya , although they are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . \nThe NTC and its Western backers are acutely aware of the need to prevent Libya collapsing into the kind of chaos that plagued Iraq for years after the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 . \nThe de facto government , whose leaders plan to move to Tripoli from Benghazi this week , is trying to impose security , restore basic services and revive the energy -- based economy . \nBut in the aftermath of victory , many corpses have been found , some of slain Gaddafi soldiers , others the victims of killings in cold blood . \nA Libyan official said 75 bodies had been found at the Abu Salim hospital , which was caught up in heavy fighting , and another 35 corpses were found at the Yurmuk hospital . \nThe possibility that rebel fighters executed captured Gaddafi soldiers would pose an image problem for the NTC . \nRebel military spokesman Colonel Ahmed Bani said there was concern for the fate of 40,000 prisoners who he said had been detained by Gaddafi 's forces and who were still unaccounted for . \nIt was possible some were being held in underground bunkers in Tripoli that rebels had been unable to locate . \nIn good omens for economic recovery , officials said a vital gas export pipeline to Europe had been repaired and Libya 's biggest refinery had survived the war intact . \nIn the west , Tunisian authorities reopened the main border crossing into Libya , restoring a supply route for Tripoli , after Gaddafi forces were driven out on Friday . \nThat should help relieve a looming humanitarian crisis in the city , where food , drinking water and medicines are scarce . \nTrucks loaded with food and other goods were already moving across the Ras Jdir crossing toward Tripoli , about two hours ' drive away . \nTripoli residents queued for bread or scoured grocery shops for food . \nMany took a stoical view of their plight . \n`` This is a tax we pay for our freedom , '' said Sanusi Idhan , a layer waiting to buy food . \nThe NTC issued messages urging electricity workers to get back to work and efforts to pay the salaries of public sector workers were underway . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAmong Islamists , he is known as Abu Abdullah Assadaq -LRB- sometimes written Sadeeq and sometimes Sadik -RRB- , and yet another form , Abd ul-Hakin Belhadj . \nHe is a former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- -LRB- also known as Al-Jama a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah bi-Libya -RRB- , which was formed specifically to oust Muammar Gaddafi . \nThe group was banned internationally as a terrorist organization following the 9\\/11\\/01 terrorists attacks on the U.S. Today the group is known as the Libyan Islamic Movement . \nThe LIGF had numerous ties to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden . \n-LRB- you can find the complete article -RRB- Now you get the picture of who the `` rebels '' really are and what they are after ... . \nMedia habitually tells us that Libyan rebels are noble freedom fighters , struggling aganist a bloodthirsty tyrant . \nBut after all the buckets of half-truths and blatant lies , that news poured on our heads , treating us viewers like brainless sheep and feeding us half-baked reports that often got disproved the next day , some of us started to look further and investigate . \nWhat they found out , is extremely disturbing . \nSay , from the very beginning of war we 've been hearing reports about `` Gaddafi 's black mercenaries '' . \nWe even saw photos and videos of several people that , supposedly , were these mercenaries . \nBut the whole truth is much more complicated -- and scary . \nYes , there indeed are several divisions of black Africans and citizens of Chad in the army of Libya , that is formed on

of beatings of black Africans began in February and March . \nThe rebels , under the trademark of fighting with the mercenaries from Chad , were slaughtering all black people with no mercy . \nBack in early March , the Human Rights Watch even warned black migrant workers on the need to flee the revolutionary terrain . \n`` We left behind our friends from Chad . \nWe left behind their bodies . \nWe had 70 or 80 people from Chad working for our company . \nThey cut them dead with pruning shears and axes , attacking them , saying you 're providing troops for Gaddafi . \nThe Sudanese , the Chadians

'' \nHe said Gaddafi would not leave his position nor Libya . \nHours later NATO planes bombed targets in the capital , causing damage and casualties , Libyan state television said , without giving details . \nNATO said it had hit a `` command and control node . '' \nA Reuters witness heard at least six blasts early on Saturday , the largest to hit the capital in several weeks , four of them shaking the hotel hosting international media . \nRebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said Gaddafi must agree publicly to stand down before any talks could begin . \n`` There are no negotiations with this regime unless he declares his departure and that he is stepping down , he and his sons , from power , '' he said in a weekly statement to Libyans broadcast on rebel-run television . \nAs Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement . \nBut the United States also says Gaddafi must go . \nIbrahim said Libyan officials - but not Gaddafi himself - would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels , who now control roughly half of Libya , only on the government 's terms . \n`` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' he said . \nGaddafi is urging Libyans to persuade rebels to disarm and rejoin the loyal fold -- and to fight them if they do n't . \nHis comments came as Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of recent fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water plant . \nNATO said the strike targeted a `` military storage facility '' rather than the water pipeline plant . \nAs Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts , a European diplomat said a U.N. envoy would seek to persuade the warring parties to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power-sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi . \nThe diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times . \nJalil , who heads the rebels ' Transitional National Council that many Western nations now recognize as the Libyan authority , told Reuters on Saturday that Khatib 's plan for power-sharing could be discussed as long as Gaddafi himself was out . \n`` Any diplomatic solutions are acceptable if they include this main condition , '' he said . \nA rebel spokesman told Reuters that Khatib would come to their eastern stronghold of Benghazi early next week . \nPoorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . \nThey declared advances this week but they also suffered losses near their enclave of Misrata and in fighting for Brega . \nGaddafi has stepped up his defiant rhetoric amid persistent reports of talks . \nPro-government rallies are being shown almost daily on state television , perhaps a reminder to outsiders that he can still command considerable support . \nOn Friday , thousands gathered near Tripoli 's historic center for the unveiling of a massive likeness of the longtime leader . \nState television said Gaddafi would make another speech on Saturday , this time addressed to Egyptians on the anniversary of their revolution -- not this year 's , which toppled President Hosni Mubarak , but pan-Arabist Gamal Abdel-Nasser 's in 1959 . \nNasser was a role model for Gaddafi who seized power in a coup as a young revolutionary . \nSpokesman Ibrahim denied a rebel report that Mansour Daw , a key aide to Gaddafi , had been wounded in a rebel rocket attack in Tripoli on Thursday . \nHe said there had been an explosion but it was caused by a kitchen gas cylinder . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nLet the leaders of both factions stand down and then talk to each other . \nWhat kind of idiot says they will negotiate with the opposing faction as soon as they leave power ? \n`` As Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement ...

'' \nThey said Gaddafi 's troops were using tanks and snipers against residents , littering the streets with corpses and filling hospitals with the wounded . \n`` You have to visit Misrata to see the massacre by Gaddafi , '' said Omar Boubaker , a 40-year-old engineer with a bullet wound to the leg , brought to the Tunisian port of Sfax by a French aid group . \n`` Corpses are in the street . \nHospitals are overflowing .

'' \nStalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting , or facing food and fuel shortages , have prompted a flurry of diplomacy to try to end the civil war . \nTurkey said it was seeking to broker a ceasefire as an envoy from Gaddafi 's government arrived in Ankara from Athens . \n`` Turkey will continue to do its best to end the sufferings and to contribute to the process of making a road map that includes the political demands of Libyan people , '' Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said after the arrival of Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi from earlier talks in Greece . \nTurkey also expected officials of the rebel National Council to visit Ankara soon , Davutoglu told a news conference . \nA Turkish Foreign Ministry official said both sides had `` conveyed that they have some opinions about a possible ceasefire . '' \nObeidi later also held talks in Malta . \nITALY SAYS GADDAFI MUST GOT Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , who had spoken to Greek officials after Obeidi 's talks in Athens , dismissed the Libyan message . \n`` A solution for the future of Libya has a pre-condition : that Gaddafi 's regime leaves and is out and that Gaddafi himself and his family leave the country , '' he said . \nIn Washington , the U.S. Treasury said it had lifted sanctions against former Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa in the hopes that other senior officials would defect . \n-LRB- nWNA5394 -RRB- Koussa fled to Britain last week and Scottish police want to question him over the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing , for which Libya accepted responsibility and paid compensation to relatives of the 270 dead . \nU.N.-mandated air strikes to protect civilians have so far failed to halt attacks in Misrata by the Libyan army . \nAt least five people died when Gaddafi forces shelled a residential area of Misrata late on Monday , a doctor said , warning the death toll was likely to keep rising . \n`` The reception in the hospital is full . \nFive people were confirmed killed in the last two hours and five more are in critical condition , '' the doctor , who gave his name as Ramadan , told Reuters by phone from the city . \nLibyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . \nAccounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . \nA Turkish ship that sailed into Misrata to rescue 250 wounded was protected by Turkish warplanes and warships and had to leave in a hurry after thousands pressed forward on the dock , pleading to be evacuated . \nAnother ship operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres docked in Sfax with 71 wounded from Misrata . \nIn Algiers , a senior security official said that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , the Islamist group 's regional wing , was getting hold of weapons in Libya . \nThe Algerian official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a convoy of eight Toyota pick-up trucks had left eastern Libya and headed via Chad and Niger to northern Mali , where in the past few days it had delivered a cargo of weapons . \n`` We know that this is not the first convoy and that it is still ongoing , '' the official said . \n`` Several military barracks have been pillaged in this region -LRB- eastern Libya -RRB- with their arsenals and weapons stores , and the elements of AQIM who were present could not have failed to profit from this opportunity .

'' \nClinton 's announcement came as the Libya Contact Group , meeting in Istanbul , formally recognized the opposition as the representative of the Libyan people -- sealing its diplomatic status as the successor government to embattled leader Muammar Gaddafi . \nThe contact group , made up of more than 30 governments and international and regional organizations , also authorized U.N. special envoy Abdul Elah Al-Khatib to present terms for Gaddafi to leave power in a political package that will include a ceasefire to halt fighting in the civil war . \nClinton said any deal `` must involve Gaddafi 's departure '' from power and a halt to violence . \n`` Increasingly the people of Libya are looking past Gaddafi . \nThey know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gaddafi will leave power , but when , '' she said . \nU.S. officials said the decision on formal diplomatic recognition marked an important step toward unblocking more than $ 34 billion in Libyan assets in the United States but cautioned it could still take time to get funds flowing to the cash-strapped Benghazi council . \n`` We expect this step on recognition will enable the TNC to access additional sources of funding , '' Clinton told reporters after the meeting , saying Washington would discuss with allies `` the most effective and appropriate method '' to do this . \nThey also said no decisions had been made on upgrading U.S. representation in Benghazi -- now a small office headed by special envoy Chris Stevens -- or on bringing the TNC into the United Nations and other international organizations . \nClinton acknowledged that the United States had `` taken its time '' in deciding on formal recognition of the TNC , but now firmly believed this was the way forward . \n`` We think they are have made great strides and are on the right path , '' she said . \nU.S. President Barack Obama signed an executive order on February 25 freezing the assets of Gaddafi , his family and top officials , as well as the Libyan government , the country 's central bank and sovereign wealth funds . \nMost of the frozen assets are liquid in the form of cash and securities . \nU.S. officials have pledged to free up some of the money for the TNC , which has run dangerously short of cash to pay for salaries and basic services even as it takes on more of the responsibilities of government . \nBut discussions with Congress on mechanisms to free up the money ran into legal complications -- some of which could be swept away by U.S. recognition of the TNC as Libya 's legitimate government . \n`` Our hope is that in a relatively short time frame we will be able to make progress -LRB- on funds -RRB- but there 's a lot of moving pieces here , '' one senior State Department official said . \nThe United States could direct banks to transfer frozen funds directly to the TNC , but this might still run foul of U.N. financial sanctions in place on Libya . \nA second option would be for the United States to establish a line of credit backed by the frozen assets as several other countries have done . \nClinton 's announcement formally recognizing the TNC marked the end of a process which began in February when Obama declared that Gaddafi had lost his legitimacy as Libya 's leader because of his brutal response to anti-government protesters . \n`` We wanted to send a very clear signal to Gaddafi and the people around him that we are looking past Gaddafi to a future without him , '' the senior U.S. official said . \n`` We felt that taking this step today sends that message loud and clear .

Security Council imposed a no-fly zone last week and air strikes began on Libyan military targets . \nBut in Brussels , a NATO official said planning for NATO 's operation assumed a mission lasting 90 days , although this could be extended or shortened as required . \nFrance said the war could drag on for weeks . \n`` I doubt that it will be days , '' Admiral Edouard Guillaud , the head of French armed forces , told France Info radio . \n`` I think it will be weeks . \nI hope it will not take months . '' \nGuillaud said a French plane destroyed an army artillery battery near Ajdabiyah , while in London , the Ministry of Defense said British Tornado aircraft had also been active there . \nA Reuters correspondent who traveled close to Ajdabiyah during the day on Friday saw large plumes of black smoke rising above the eastern entrance to the town . \nA rocket apparently fired from rebel positions then hit the eastern gate , sending a fireball into the sky . \n`` The eastern gate has fallen and we are sending a team to check before moving forward , '' rebel Colonel Hamad al-Hasi told Reuters . \nIn Benghazi , rebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said he expected Ajdabiyah to fall following the Western strikes . \n`` This -LRB- the strikes -RRB- will weaken their forces and more importantly their morale , '' he said , adding the level of Western strikes was `` sufficient . \nWe feel safe under their protection .

'' \nColonel Hamed Al-Hasi , commander of the anti-Gaddafi Qatar brigade east of Sirte , said the truce had expired Sunday , but a full assault was still out of the question . \n`` There are still more than 15,000 persons inside . \nWe can not sacrifice them , '' he said . \nHe said NTC forces would for now instead be targeting the district of Bouhadi , just to the south of Sirte . \nHe said a captured Gaddafi loyalist had told them that Mo'atassem , one of the deposed Libyan leader 's sons and his former national security adviser , was in the district . \n`` We 've been concentrating since last night on Bouhadi , '' he said . \n`` If we catch Mo'atassem , things will calm down . '' \nNATO warplanes were more in evidence than in previous days , with aircraft flying unusually low over the city . \nIn one 10-minute period there was a steady rumble from bombs dropping on an area south of the city , a Reuters reporter said . \nLibyans ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule in August when rebel fighters stormed the capital . \nGaddafi and several of his sons are still at large , and his supporters hold Sirte and the town of Bani Walid , south of Tripoli . \nGaddafi 's supporters are too weak to regain power , but their resistance is frustrating the new rulers ' efforts to start building the post-Gaddafi Libya . \nWhile it needs to stamp out the last resistance swiftly , the NTC does not want to use indiscriminate shelling , which could hurt its standing and make it even harder to govern Libya 's fractious tribes and regions . \nGaddafi loyalists and some civilians have blamed NATO air strikes and shelling by anti-Gaddafi forces for the deaths of civilians in Sirte . \nBoth NATO and the NTC deny that and say it is the Gaddafi loyalists who are endangering civilians by using them as human shields . \nKhalid Ahmed , who fled the city early Sunday , said the residential area where he lives in the center of Sirte had come under heavy artillery fire Saturday . \n`` The reason there is shooting in the city center is that the pro-Gaddafi militia has positioned artillery in the buildings where civilians live . \nThe children are terrified and they are screaming all the time . '' \nHe said he had been able to get out by borrowing money to buy black-market fuel . \nHe said the rate in Sirte now was 600 dinars , or about $ 450 , for 20 litres of fuel . \nDoctors at a field hospital east of Sirte said four NTC fighters had been killed Sunday in `` friendly fire '' incidents -- testament to the often-chaotic conduct of the anti-Gaddafi forces . \nThe focus on the battle for the last pro-Gaddafi strongholds -- and on tracking down Gaddafi himself -- has left a power vacuum in Tripoli . \nWith no process in motion for electing a new leadership , power on the ground is wielded by anti-Gaddafi militias who are jockeying with each other for influence in the new Libya . \nSome analysts warn that this rivalry could turn violent . \nOne commander in Tripoli said he was setting up an armed group to keep order in the city , even though that function is already carried out by a body led by Abdulhakim Belhadj , a former militant Islamist . \n`` Who is he ? \nWho appointed him ? '' \nsaid Abdullah Ahmed Naker , the head of the new group , when asked about Belhadj . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe quotes in the title might make someone take this the wrong way . \nNato does n't seem to mind killing civilians who belong to tribes who wo n't succumb to it . \nThe fall of Sirte was first reported 28\\/08\\/2011 by Haaretz . \nAfter that date a stream of reports stating that surrender of the Libyan Armes Forces -LRB- LAF -RRB- was imminent and giving totally contradictory distances of the `` advancing '' rebel forces which according to BBC 29\\/08\\/2011 were 18 miles from the city center -- this figure actually increased as the days went by . \nOver a month later the same reports of an imminenet rebel victory in Sirte from the media . \nFurther , the repeated myth of only two cities still under Libyan Govt . \ncontrol just does n't fit the facts . \n80 % of the country remains under LAF control and the town of Ghadames has just been retaken by them . \nA counter offensive has been anounced by the LAF . \nKhamis Gaddafi has been reported dead at on at least 5 different occasions only to miraculously reappear sever days later idem Ibrahim Moussa . \nFrom the beginning of the civil war and intervention of Nato the rebels have been killing each other starting with the summary execution of the rebel General Younes . \nIt is clear that : 1 -RRB- The majority of Libyans are against the CNT rebels and oppose the British , French and Qattari presence . \n2 -RRB- Without Nato air support the civil war would have been over months ago and the rebels in prison . \n3 -RRB- The CNT , even with the miliary support of NATO , is a disparate puppet group representing corporate and western interests and will be incapable of governing the country -- their leaders are already resigning or grasping for power . \n4 -RRB- The inaccurate and selective reporting by the media of this civil war has directly contributed to British and French citizens accepting that their respective governments order the bombing of tens of thousands of ordinary Libyan citizens . \nWhen will the truth and ordinary Libyans become important to news publications ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nMost of Libya is nominally under the control of the new interim government , but security provision is patchy and fighting is still going on at Sirte , on the Mediterranean coast , and at Bani Walid , south-east of Tripoli . \nJust weeks ago , 17 people were killed in a raid by militia at Ras Lanuf , Libya 's largest refinery . \n`` There 's no security , no electricity , no food and looting at the warehouses , '' said Hetwash . \n`` In some areas 90 percent of spare parts and motors have been destroyed , and we can not start production until they are replaced because it is dangerous , '' he added . \nIt could take six months to restore the facilities at the fields seen by the Waha Oil team , Hetwash said , and the restart is being held up by key workers who say they will not return to the fields until managers , seen as remnants of Gaddafi 's regime , agree to step down . \nHe said if the internal dispute is resolved , engineers and other workers are ready to start the work of getting Waha Oil 's fields back on stream . \n`` Most of the people that produce the oil are here . \nWe can do without them , the managers . \nWe can start from tomorrow if we can have enough transport , equipment , tools and materials , '' Hetwash said . \nAlong with hundreds of Waha Oil employees , Hetwash was at a rally on Sunday outside the company 's headquarters to demand a change of management . \nThe protest reflected the freedom that Libyans are now enjoying after Gaddafi 's autocratic rule came to an end , and the grievances that built up for decades . \nBefore , security forces would stop any public show of dissent . \n`` The chairman and members must go immediately , and not wait another minute , '' said Widad El Said , a secretary at the company for four years . \n`` Everything has stopped for eight months and this is not good for Libya . \nBut all the employees in the fields have refused to go back because they will never trust the management again '' she said . \nIn August , Marathon Oil said it has had preliminary discussions with the interim government , the National Transitional Council , on restarting output at the Waha field . \nBut the firm said it would n't send staff back to Libya until it could ensure their safety . \n-LRB- Editing by Christian Lowe and Jane Merriman -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "52", "time": "2011-07-14", "text": "ISTANBUL | Thu Jul 14 , 2011 2:23 pm BST ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Western powers and Arab states meeting in Istanbul on Friday will seek a political solution to end the civil war in Libya , amid conflicting signals over whether Muammar Gaddafi intends to fight on or surrender power . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the EU 's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton are among more than a dozen ministers attending the Libyan contact group meeting , its fourth since an emergency summit in London in March . \n`` The main aim is to find a political solution to accelerate efforts to end the bloodshed , '' said Selcuk Unal , spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry hosting the talks in Istanbul . \nHeads of NATO , the Arab League , African Union and Gulf Cooperation Council will also attend along with representatives of the Libyan opposition . \nThe U.N. Secretary-General 's special envoy on Libya , Abdul Elah Al-Khatib , will report results of contacts with the beleaguered Gaddafi government in Tripoli and the rebel National Transitional Council based in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nThere will also be updates on the flow of financial and humanitarian assistance to the rebel-held areas . \nRussian and China , two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council that have taken softer line on Gaddafi , were invited for a first time to attend a contact group meeting . \nBut China has said it would skip the meeting while it was uncertain who Russia would send . \nMahmoud Jebril , a senior member of the rebel council , said in Brussels on Wednesday that there had been no negotiations so far with Gaddafi 's regime to end the civil war that began with a popular uprising against his 41-year rule in February . \nGaddafi is resisting rebel advances on Tripoli from the eastern desert and western mountains , and the drawn-out conflict and lack of substantive talks have frustrated NATO allies who are helping the rebels by enforcing a no-fly zone and bombing Gaddafi forces deemed a threat to civilians . \nThe international community wants to ensure that the oil - and gas-rich North African country of 6 million people emerges as a stable democracy rather than falling prey to ethnic or tribal conflict , or becoming a haven for Islamist militants . \nAmong items to be discussed in Istanbul will be a recommendation by a British-led team planning post-conflict Libya for Gaddafi 's security forces to be left intact after a rebel victory in order to avoid errors made after the Iraq war . \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said earlier this week that emissaries from Gaddafi 's government were in contact with NATO members , and were saying that Gaddafi was ready to quit . \nA crucial question , should Gaddafi agree to step down , will be whether he is allowed to stay in Libya or has to take refuge in a third country despite a U.N.-backed International Criminal Court investigation into crimes against his people . \nClinton said on Wednesday in Washington that Gaddafi 's intentions were unclear . \n`` We are still getting contradictory signals from Colonel Gaddafi 's camp , '' she said during a visit by Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . \n`` He has yet to meet the red lines that are set by the international community to cease violence against his people , withdraw his forces and step down from power . '' \nClinton said the while the United States and Russia could not predict exactly when Gaddafi would go , `` we do understand and agree that his days are numbered '' . \nLavrov said Moscow 's position on the enforcement of U.N. resolutions on Libya differed somewhat from that of NATO powers , but this would not stop Russian efforts to get peace talks going . \n`` We are united in that we have to start the political process as soon as possible and we have different channels , official and not very official channels , to work through to create conditions for this process , '' he said . \nThe White House later issued a statement that President Barack Obama welcomed Russia 's efforts to mediate a political solution and back talks towards a democratic transition so long as Gaddafi stepped aside . \nTurkey and the African Union have proposed separate road maps aimed at establishing a cease-fire and moving through stages from Gaddafi quitting power to a democratic transition , and the contact group will seek to agree on a single plan . \nTurkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has voiced hopes last week that significant progress towards a political solution could be made before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan , which this year falls at the beginning of August . \n"}
{"id": "344", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "If in Libya , why not also in Ivory Coast ? \nWhen Ivory Coast s election last year left the country with two men claiming to be president and a flood of warnings of the threat of civil war , the world s diplomatic and media interest was unprecedented . \nAfter a turbulent four months , which have seen two North African revolutions , a tsunami and near nuclear meltdown in Japan , and Libya s ongoing war , how that has changed . \nThe West African nation s crisis is grizzly but also in a slow-burn mode and hardly getting a look in with all the drama elsewhere . \nThe international recognition of Alassane Ouattara as victor and sanctions slapped on his rival , incumbent Laurent Gbagbo , who refuses to step down , are still in place . \nBut so is Gbagbo , and Ouattara remains holed up in a hotel , protected by a ring of United Nations peacekeepers . \nThreats , made by West Africa s ECOWAS bloc , to oust him have rung hollow . \nScores of people have since been killed , hundreds of thousands of have fled their homes amid heavy fighting and rights groups are warning crimes against humanity may have already taken place . \nBoth sides have been accused of abuses but the most serious charges including the killing of women protestors calling for Gbagbo to leave have been levelled at Gbagbo . \nOne was even been caught on camera , here , but Gbagbo 's camp has denied responsibility . \nThe country s economy has disintegrated while the IMF warns the regional one is in peril . \nThe long-flagged war has , arguably , already begun . \nYet , it appears there are only so many crises the world can handle at any one time and , right now , television cameras and diplomats are looking elsewhere . \nNigeria s foreign minister has accused the international community of double standards by imposing the no-fly zone in Libya while doing little in Ivory Coast . \nLiberia , still recovering from its own conflict , is struggling to raise funds it needs to deal with the refugees it is now taking in . \nOuattara has scolded his U.N. backers for not doing enough to protect civilians . \nWith a crisis like Libya taking place , is it only natural that Ivory Coast should drop down the agenda ? \nCivilians in Ivory Coast , where there is a U.N. peacekeeping mission with a robust mandate , have also been promised protection . \nYet , so far , no robust action has been taken , even though the U.N. has accused pro-Gbagbo forces of using heavy weapons against civilians in Abidjan . \nWhat is the difference between Ivory Coast and Libya ? \nIs it just the scale of the abuses or are there other factors at play ? \nSome analysts and this blogger say Libya s oil makes it more important than Ivory Coast , the world 's top cocoa grower . \nThe African Union had only just finally ironed out internal divisions over supporting Ouattara when it then had to set up another crisis team to deal with Libya . \nIt is wary about too robust an intervention in either case and was still speaking out against military intervention in Libya even after a U.N. resolution had authorised it , and the Western forces had fired their first shots . \nCan the AU play a meaningful role in resolving Ivory Coast s crisis . \nIf so , what ? \nEarlier today I was asking myself the same question and it is very hard to not imagine that oil is more important to the world that chocolate , why else would the events in Libya be attracting so much more attention than similar atrocities being committed on African 's across the continent . \nWhat worries me is that the winds of change are blowing but more often than not the response will be that of Libya and the World 's policemen -LRB- US , UN , NATO , EU , etc. -RRB- can not be in all the places they will be needed at the same time . \nThe AU in my opinion is rather pointless and too often seems to want to fall back on ex-South African president Thabo Mbeki 's ` quiet diplomacy ' ! \nSimple the two scenario are not same ; Libyan people started the move in Tripoli , while UN is orchestrating what is happening in Ivory Coast . \nNations should be allowed without any form of inducement or cohesion to settle their problem internally . \nElection dispute in Ivory Coast would have been a thing of the past if UN had not taken side in the dispute . \nMaybe the UN verdict into the elections was not perfect and there were problems from both sides . \nHowever , peace is nearly always better than war . \nI admire those leaders who have preferred to step down , even if they do n't think the outcome was fully fair , rather than see a lot of bloodshed . \nA leader 's position should never be more important than the lives , safety and futures of the people . \nAre values not more important than power ? \nIs the western world really interested in saving the libyan population ? \nThey are just looking after the Libyan oil . \nIf saving the people was really important , they should be going to Cote divoire where Gbagbo is killing his own people every single day just to stay in power . \nunfortunately there 's no oil in Cote dIvoire . \nworld should oppose ongoing western air strikes launched against Libya on the ground that ordinary Libyans would be affected and the air attacks would prove counterproductive to the US ' purported humanitarian objective . \nthere are many other hot spots around the world would US do the same . \nIn fact as per records US has never been seen saving lives where they matter most . \nThe video of the female protesters being killed is disturbing . \nThose unarmed women were not a threat to anyone . \nSomeone did not like what they were saying or perhaps more accurately , someone did n't like that those women decided that they had a right to voice their opinions . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI have been previously based in a number of African cities , including Abidjan , Kinshasa and Dar es Salaam . \n"}
{"id": "179", "time": "2011-03-23", "text": "Once again , Western bombs are falling on the sand-blown weapons testing range that is north Africa , the Middle East and the landscape of the old Great Game . \nThe area stretching roughly from Morocco to Afghanistan west to east , and Syria to the Persian Gulf north to south -- let s call this region Deathistan -- long has been contested . \nBut in the last century , the region has been treated as a plaything by Western capitals . \nThe United States and United Kingdom , which boast of enlightenment , cause harm when they please in the Deathistan region . \nLess than a generation ago it amused the United States to encourage Saddam Hussein to slaughter Iranians ; then conditions changed , so the United States started killing in Iraq . \nRight now the United States and NATO are taking lives in Libya and Afghanistan . \nIn these places , U.S. and other Western armed forces in the main behave with high ethics . \nBut their missions are to slay and destroy , and here s the bottom line : Western meddling in north Africa , the Arab world and the Great Game territories has not worked . \nIsrael exists : that is the West s principal achievement in the region , though for a comparatively small number of people . \nOtherwise , the last century of attempts by the United States and European powers to manipulate the Deathistan region rarely has come to good . \nWe ve sure blown a lot of stuff up . \nWhen innocents were killed inside the United States on 9-11 , America claimed , with justification , a right of outrage . \nWhen innocents are killed by Western action elsewhere -- hundreds of thousands have died in Iraq and Afghanistan in the U.S. retaliation for the 3,000 dead of 2001 -- the West washes its hands , or issues a press release . \nMuammar Gaddafi is an awful dictator . \nBut no one in the Washington or London establishments seemed to care about that even a short time ago . \nLibyan oil money was moving freely ; in 2009 , Gaddafi was presented to the world by the New York Times as an op-ed columnist , as a leader and sage . \nNow the West is bombing Libya , without debate in Congress or European parliaments -- and over the objections of Turkey , which understands much of the region better than does the West . \nThough aimed at Gaddafi s arms , some of the bombs are killing civilians : others , killing military conscripts who have little choice about their fates . \nMaybe the bombing will stop Gaddafi from repressing his country . \nMaybe it will just smash some stuff and usher in a different type of repression -- this being the Western pattern of interactions with the region . \nDespite extensive Western involvement in Deathistan , most nations there remain backward and authoritarian . \nMaybe that s in part because of Western meddling , including periodic fits of use of force . \nMuch of the modern form of the region was created by Western fiat . \nBorders of Iraq , Iran and many Gulf states were drawn in London ; British troops occupied Iran during World War II ; the United States deposed a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953 , then tried to control Iran in the 1970s ; then armed Iraq against Iran in the 1980s ; now regularly shakes its fist at Tehran ; Britain and France attacked Egypt in 1956 ; the United States armed Islamic rebels in Afghanistan in the 1980s and now fights Islamic rebels there . \nI don t mean this paragraph as a history of the region , merely a brief reminder of the extent of Western involvement . \nThe fact that Europe and the United States shaped the Deathistan region does not give them a right to do as they please there . \nOf course the West should advocate change . \nBut there s a vast difference between siding with democracy and sending in attack jets . \nChoose any nation roughly the geographic size of Iraq -LRB- say , Spain -RRB- or roughly the population of Libya -LRB- say , Sicily -RRB- . \nIf the United States had staged all-out attacks on Spain twice in the last 20 years , or bombed Sicily twice in the last 25 years , how advanced or happy might these nations be ? \nThat s what the United States has done to Iraq and Libya . \nSuppose really something bad were happening in America . \nSuppose George W. Bush refused to leave office : was barricaded in the White House , and attempting to cancel civil liberties . \nNow suppose Libya or Iraq possessed supercarrier strike groups , and responded to the bad news from the United States by launching missiles at military bases near Washington and dropping bombs along the East Coast . \nNot only would America be furious -- this wouldn t work ! \nThings would not get better in America ; they d get worse . \nYet the West expects such tactics to work in north Africa , the Middle East and the old Great Game areas . \nI will skip the complication that use of force may be morally wrong : is there one single soul in Washington who still cares about morality in use of force ? \nIt is enough that the bottom line is that U.S. meddling usually fails . \nIf the United States and European Union stopped trying to manipulate the Deathistan region , and stopped dropping bombs there , the nations of this area might stay backward and repressive . \nOr , might improve . \nWe ll never find out until such time as the West simply leaves these nations alone , and lets them reform themselves . \nPhoto , top to bottom : People look at a U.S Air Force F-15E fighter jet after it crashed near the eastern city of Benghazi March 22 , 2011 . \nThe fighter jet crashed in Libya overnight after apparent mechanical failure but its crew were safe , a spokesman for the U.S. military Africa Command said on Tuesday . \nREUTERS\\/Suhaib Salem ; A protester sits in a makeshift shelter on a street during an anti-Gaddafi demonstration in Benghazi March 22 , 2011 . \nObama has proved to be an imperialist not unlike W. What a dirty farce ! \nLike your term in quotes . \nThe sudden shift from dragging one 's feet to support a no-fly zone , to taking leaderhsip in all out bombing was quite unexpected and drastic . \nIt almost seems like they wanted to use the Arab League 's support as an excuse ; and once they got it , their action betrayed a certain insincerity . \nI hope the fighting end soon , with limited casualty for everyone . \nI have reservations about whether some of the Middle Eastern conflicts are going to result in democracies . \nEgypt is hopeful , but not many of the others , Libya included . \nIf the civil war becomes protracted , even if there will be fair democratic elections , those who had voted for losig candidates often resort to violence . \nLook at Ivory Coast . \nNot to be a pessimist , but such situations seem rather common in Africa . \nPerhaps the biggest disappointment in the region is the gross incompetence of Western governments , especially the USA . \nThere are plenty of neutral American citizens who have first hand knowledge of and on the ground experience in the region . \nI exclude all recipients of Federal funding however indirect . \nConsultation with these experienced people would have avoided the worst mistakes at least . \nBut we will not . \nWe have expert commentators on Government radio -LRB- NPR -RRB- who do not seem to know that Turks are not arabs , yet have ever so delicate evaluations of the accuracy of Turkish opinion . \nThis is not only absurd , it is embarrassing . \nSince we will not even attempt to act in the interest of the American people as a whole , we need to put a flat Cuban style embargo on the whole region until we grow up . \nThe bureaucrats hands must be tied and tightly . \nSo what 's the point of the UN Security Council ? \nWhy are we a part of it ? \nWe should have used our resources to take out Iran 's nuclear program and perhaps their leaders if we should bomb anyone . \nWe are n't doing them or us any favors . \nWhether it 's capitalists or democratic government it really all comes down to having access to cheap oil . \nIf they did n't have oil the US would n't be there . \nNow no one can deny that the foreign Policy of the United States has always been a twisted loop of hypocrisy in the Middle East and even globally . \nBut to generalize the current situation in Libya and make comparisons to the invasions of Iraq , Afghanistan in the last decade as well as previous foreign policy disasters of previous decades is inflammatory at best . \nAs the worlds only nation that can project considerable power anywhere in the world within 48 hours , it is our responsibility to lead and act to prevent humanitarian disasters in conjunction with local , regional and international consultation . \nThere is no indication or confirmation of any civilians killed by coalition aircraft in Libya to date . \nThere is a clear UN mandate that specifies no ground troops and a clear indication that the opposition forces in Libya wanted , in fact begged for western protection against overwhelming and indiscriminate attacks by Gaddafi forces against cities and civilian targets . \nThis is not Iraq in 2003 , and its not Afghanistan . \nWith great power comes great responsibility , like it or not we have a role to play in the Middle East and without pressure from the United States none of the current revolutions in the Middle East would have succeeded without considerable bloodshed if at all . \nIt is the only reason the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia step down as quietly as they did . \nWhat is happening right now in the Middle East is not because of the United States , but of the people . \nThis is the best chance in 50 years to make a meaningful change in one of the most volatile and radical regions of the world . \nWe must stand ready to assist , not interfere but assist when absolutely necessary the pro-democracy movements lest they be brutally crushed by these regimes , and we are stuck continuing with brutal regimes that oppress their populations and drive people towards extremism and violence . \nI understand your opinion , but given the completely different circumstances of the situation in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan and international and regional support for action we must take a lead as is our responsibility . \nBecause if we do n't do it , no one will . \nWe can not fear to act in the future , because of mistakes in the past . \nYou left out the cold war . \nYou leave out the military actions in other parts of the world fueled by the cold war . \nThe three super powers The USSR , the USA and China all wanted a long reach and they have played the balance of powers game that was the rule of European politics since the Middle Ages . \nIn fact it has been the rule for all empires for as long as they have existed . \nThe balance of powers is expected and not to participate is to declare weakness to the other powers . \nThe big powers frighten each other into action . \nAnd all the empires that have ever existed have died long and lingering deaths to be replaced by new powers . \nThe new powers cannibalize the old . \nI am old enough to remember history classes that praised the virility of countries that could support aggressive military action and not merely defensive capability . \nFor some reason the USA keeps declaring itself the sole super power and doesn t seem to realize that rhetoric might be out of date . \nI m sure the British and French still think they are or might yet reclaim some of their old martial and territorial glory or at least can play on the memory of it . \nThe superpower has to push against something as large and strong or it will fall over . \nIn a way it is making the rival empire it needs out of Deathistan as you call the countries of the Magreb and Levant . \nYou don t mention the rhetoric of the Middle East just listen to the way the Israeli s and Palestinians talk about each other in fits of rage . \nThey still believe in the glory of war and the Israeli s still believe in the right of holding territory by conquest . \nThe Iranians still like that Death to America mantra . \nThe Middle East has a fondness for Iron handed leadership . \nPerhaps what should really scare the US is that it is tending to have to make the greatest efforts and spend the largest fortunes for dubious returns in order to achieve goals the rest of the world seems to want -LRB- the rights outlined in the UN Universal Bill of Human Rights ? -RRB- \nwhile the rest of the so called former super powers and the rest of the smaller countries tend to want a less active role and watch from a distance and wait while it slowly falls apart economically and politically . \nThey can play the economic lambs to our ravenous beast . \nAnd then declare how stupid we were for being so arrogant . \nSo many people admire and envy a superstar but they also love to watch it become over-extended and fall apart . \nThe supermarket tabloids love the collapse of the rich and famous . \nDiplomats and heads of state read classier and more complex tales of the rise and fall of the formerly great . \nAnother thing you don t mention , and where this comment may be so na ve , is that the collapse of the middle class in this country is making conditions that could be ripe for a tyranny to take over this country -LRB- some would say we are already there -RRB- that feeds on war as an outlet for the frustration of it s own population . \nThen the US could be a world-dominating scourge of humanity . \nBut if that is the case this paragraph should go at the top and the rest would still follow , just perhaps not in my lifetime or in the lifetime of those still in grammar school . \nBut they would have to be teaching a rabid patriotism for that to work and as far as I know they aren t . \nWhat a great overview of what happens when the west interferes . \nI do hope more people take note of the fact , interference in other nations affairs which seems to happen regularly by the west simply does not produve the expected result . \nAs long as you are pro - west any country can do what it likes , murder half its citizens and the west will ignore it or put out a mild press staement . \nIf the murder is done by a leader opposed to the west then the response is not as mild but close to hysterical condemnation and interferece in one form or another . \nAt thee same time the west only interferes openly in countries who can not fight back , which certainly shows how courageous the western politicians are . \nApples to oranges , Mr. Easterbrook . \nThis `` article '' is overflowing with idiotic comparisons that would n't hold water in a 5th grade book report , let alone succeed in coming close to substantiating your argument . \nI can t imagine how it can ever be perceived by logically thinking humans capable of counting to ten , as anything but a hollow-minded rant . \nHow did you get this published , anyway ? \nYour `` opinion '' is shallow , ill-conceived and presented poorly at its best . \nI have yet to hear from a single source that innocent Libyan `` civilians '' have officially been killed by Western forces , either by air or land strike . \nI agree that it is highly questionable that we empower Gaddhafi at first then daemonize him when he complicates our energy resources ... but that 's the nature of world politics . \nAnd for the sake of human rights and treaty efforts , I do n't think it would have been smart to denounce Gaddhafi as leader in the West -- look what that did to Cambodia -- it gives the impression that all potential interventions are out -LRB- nobody cares -RRB- . \nI also do n't think allies `` encourage '' allies , in the Hussein Iran example you `` responsibly '' made , in times of war to kill as simply as you implied . \nDo n't forget that there were innocent civilians under Hussein 's regime who were being attacked . \nLibya would have been another Rwanda , Darfur , and we 'd be left shaking our heads again -- no matter what , you 're not going to `` win '' participating or watching violence . \nYou 're choice : are you a selfish perv , or a murdering idealist ? \nYou need a reality check . \nSpain is not Libya . \nSicily is not Iraq . \nTheir leaders are not raping the citizens of all their wealth . \nOil money from Iraq and Libya went straight to the dictator 's pockets . \nYou are living in a democracy and have the freedom to write tripe like this . \nNontheless , your opinions are not widely held , thank God . \nWhat a load of rubbish . \nBut for the oil and natural gas under their feet , the entire world would care about this `` vital region '' as much as they do about the Seychelle Islands . \nBut their fossil fuel resources bring them wealth and influence disproportionate to their actual economic contributions to the world economy and its culture . \nThe spoils of this wealth have allowed murderous thugs to maintain themselves in a style an Ottoman sultan would have blushed at . \nI forget , how many palaces did Saddam Hussein have ? \nThey must all have been justified by the legacy of colonialism -LRB- Up yours Imperialists ! -RRB- . \nOne looks on in admiration at what went on in Egypt and is going on elsewhere in the region where people realize they do n't have to live this way . \nBut maybe this author could also mention the proliferation of Soviet produced arms in the region . \nSurely there was no titanic geopolitical struggle that went on for 40 plus years that could explain the constant shifting of national interests that occurred . \nNope , must all be a conspiracy by the whole world -LRB- led by the perfidious West -RRB- to have cheap oil -LRB- the majority of which is controlled by an altruistic and benign cartel that meets in Vienna -RRB- under the control of pliable despots . \nOne knows Arabs are never personally responsible for anything , ever , right ? \nLeast of all the resignation that it is written they be pawns in the game of life . \nFrom Pogo : `` We have met the enemy and he is us . '' \nWell said Mr. Easterbrook . \nOf course the solutions are extremely complicated . \nBut , these simple truths must guide all solutions . \nThe simple comparison to our US homeland is a perfect example . \nThis is a beautifully written and elegantly argued column . \nA couple of years ago I would have agreed with it . \nBut Deathistan has changed . \nWhat we are seeing today in the Middle East are revolutions started not by Al Qeuda , not by the CIA , but by the people themselves . \nThese uprisings are not imposed on them , and they are not inspired by ideologues of either the Muslim or Western variety . \nThe people are fighting for democracy . \nThey have been ruled by ruthless despots for generations and have no arms to fight with , which makes their struggle all the more courageous . \nShould the West just sit back in its armchair and watch the bloody and unbalanced spectacle on TV ? \nIs that the right thing to do ? \nOr should we help them fight for a just cause which , in the case of Libya , would surely be doomed without our help ? \nI agree that the West has a bad and deserved reputation for meddling in the affairs of the Middle East -LRB- and elsewhere . -RRB- \nBut there 's an important difference between meddling solely for one 's own political or economic gain and helping in a struggle whose cause we believe in , and that would surely perish without our intervention . \nThe Middle East is younger , restless , wary of the old order , and ready for change . \nThey are realizing that clinging to an ideology is not the answer , that they need to stumble forward on the path of democracy and find their own way . \nIn some ways , we can learn from their example . \nDoes it make sense , and is it always for the good , to cling to an ideology of non-intervention , regardless of the circumstances ? \nWhat are the consequences ? \nWe all need to be aware of our ideologies . \nIt 's easy to judge Islamists and Teabaggers when they appear rigid to those who do n't share their beliefs . \nBut if you believe rigidity is a problem , take a look at the man in the mirror , and face your own non-interventionist beliefs . \nYou need n't go into such a scholarly print to decipher what 's in the minds of these politicians . \nIt 's all about oil and the dollar sign . \nWhenever there 's turmoil that threatens the flow and price of this precious liquid , the big guys are in . \nNot to save the locals , but their wallets . \nThe U.S. was swift in rescuing Kuwait from Saddam not because they like the handsome looks of the Kuwaitis . \nDid they blink an eye when locals were butchered by Indonesian forces in East Timor ? \nEasterbrook has some valid points . \nWhere this and other regional conflicts have changed recently is in the communications . \nIt would have taken hard people to ignore the often live pleas for help heard on the news channels . \nAnd of course there is the oil . \nThere are plenty of dictators in Africa who make Gadaffi seem almost saintly . \nWhat puzzle me is why UN step on their toes as soon as something does not goes the way the Western Powers would like it to be . \nThe world will be better off without Gadhafi s type of government , but the reality is , nothing is perfect in this world including the so call democracy . \nWhere these International Zorro s were when Pinochet was protected by Thatcher s government against crime of humanity ? \nWhat about Fujimori from Chile killing his people by thousands ? \nYou may say they were fighting again the bad guys ; the communists . \nSo , they deserve the support of Zorro to save the world . \nSame question can be asked about Pol Pot in Cambodia and Marcos in the Philippe and all others . \nUntil UN will be free of manipulation by Western Powers all those Zorro s will continue to shape the world to their own goods which have nothing to do with democracy . \nUnfortunately is a word to often use to justify the unjustifiable . \nNow gregg , imagine this scenario . \nA high ranking official of your state is slaughtering the people in your area . \nThis person has gone mad and is doing as he pleases with no reprocussions . \nThe people have started a revolt . \nThe have started to stand up to him . \nTo regain the basic humanitarian rights they deserve . \nAnd he being more technologically advanced goes day by day toying with their lives . \nWould you then not want help ? \nThese people are asking for help . \nWhy should we sit back and not protect those who need it when we have the ability to help ? \nIf we would give up a little luxury here and there we would not be in this financial whole we are in now and we would be able to do more for these people who have no way to defend themselves . \nYour local police department did n't always exist . \nIt was put there to protect you when you needed it . \nI know the US or the western countries as you name it are not the official police for this planet . \nSo the UN and the US has stepped up to try to protect those who need it . \nMaybe one day we can get a World Police Order put in place that would allow the world as a whole to decide what a country can do . \nWe rely to heavily on one another to let tyrants destroy the people they are put into place to protect . \nIs this battle about oil ? \nI dont know , none of us common folk do . \nWill we ever know ? \nBut whether we went in for oil or for the people , as long as we are able to save a few lives of those who are fighting every day to survive and being oppressed then for whatever reason we are there , the outcome will be better for those people . \nThey will have a chance . \nWhat comes of that chance is for them to decide . \nInteresting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? \nIt 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . \nLibya was becoming a popular tourist destination . \nThe current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs . \nIt seems to me that America is trying to shape a Libyan government that is a grateful friend at a time when not taking action might cost more lives than taking action . \nIt also appears based on the current situation that Middle East autocracies would probably do very little good for their citizens if left to their own devices . \nThe current revolutions in the area seem to be a genuine attempt by the people to improve their own lot in an otherwise hopeless situation . \nNonetheless , your arguments have some merit . \nPosted by breezinthru | Report as abusive Thank you for finally stating what has so often been relegated to `` dissident '' or `` minority '' publications on a mainstream news outlet . \nMajor figures on the American Left and Right would concur with you : from Noam Chomsky and Bernie Sanders to Ron Paul and Grover Norquist . \nThe imperialist war state will impoverish the basis of its own power -- as it did the empires of Alexander , Rome , Khan , the Soviet Union and eventually the United States . \nIn our case , it is waged in the name of defense , but any idiot knows that 's just a byline for oil : Iraq 2 being the primary and most obvious example , though this is also the case for Afghanistan -LRB- Osama , the boogieman , is STILL not wanted as a suspect for 911 , yet Unocal 's pipeline project has proceeded quite smoothly -RRB- . \nYou mention only the Middle East , but we also must realize that trade interests have motivated illegal and undemocratic regime change coups in Latin America for more than 60 years . \nThe economic benefits of our not-so-covert oil and free trade zone war Imperialism are only distributed to a few in our society , precisely because it is not `` we '' who desire or direct these efforts : it is the prerogative of the few industrial and commercial forces that stand to gain from them in the short term . \nI find the assurances that the Middle East can never find peace , and that Western nations are wasting our time , money , and everyone 's lives to be both sad and ironic . \nThe reasonic seems clear , blood feuds going back centuries , widespread inequality and violations of human rights . \nWars such as that between Iran and Iraq , and the Soviet war in Afghanistan cost about a million lives each . \nWhat hope can there be for the future ? \nBetter to just look the other way while they butcher , burn , poison , and stone each other like they have been for millenia right ? \nIronically a bit over half a centry ago it would have been just as clear that Europe was spiraling into a pattern of perpetual bloodshed of ever more massive proportions . \nThe rule of thumb was once a pan-European war once per generation . \nYet today Europe is at peace . \nHow bout tit-for-tat blood feuds ? \nConsider the history of revaunchism that led to WWII . \nThat goes back to the conquest of Prussia by the French under Napoleon in 1806 , almost a century and a half before . \n`` Civilized '' people have long memories too ! \nPrussia was forced to pay santions afterward , and those sanctions formed the basis for the sanctions placed on the French after Germany defeated France in 1871 . \nThese sanctions in turn formed the basis of those placed on Germany in the treaty of Versailles after WWI , which helped set the stage for WWII . \nAnd while the death toll seen in Middle Eastern wars and terrorism may seem shocking to us today , just one battle in WWI killed as many people as either of the two most brutal wars in the Middle East . \nWhile those wars cost a million lives a piece , the first world war cost 16 million European lives , and set the stage for world war two which cost 40 million European lives , with the firebombing of cities killing tens of thousands of civilians in a single day . \nWhat Middle-Eastern blood feud has spilled such blood ? \nThe peace in Europe today is testimony to the ability of humanity to put behind us the collective harms and insults of generations past no matter how grievous they might have been . \nIf Europe can live in peace today , peace is possible for any people , anywhere . \nInteresting point of view , but from a greedy point of view would n't it have been in America 's interest to allow Gaddafi to wipe out much of his opposition in Libya ? \nIt 's been years since Gaddafi has threatened the West and he was unlikely to do so during the rest of his life . \nLibya was becoming a popular tourist destination . \nThe current unrest is a factor in driving the price of oil higher at a time when America 's economy can ill afford increased energy costs . \nIt seems to me that America is trying to shape a Libyan government that is a grateful friend at a time when not taking action might cost more lives than taking action . \nIt also appears based on the current situation that Middle East autocracies would probably do very little good for their citizens if left to their own devices . \nThe current revolutions in the area seem to be a genuine attempt by the people to improve their own lot in an otherwise hopeless situation . \nNonetheless , your arguments have some merit . \nPosted by breezinthru | Report as abusive What we are seeing are the seeds of World War 3 sprouting . \nDeathistan is where empires go to die ... . . \nand we have seen this happen over and over again throughout history . \nIt 's amazing how if you got back even further you will observe that even back to the Greeks , Romans , Barbarians , Ottomans etc ... . . \nit 's simply the course of history repeating itself . \nEinstein said World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones ... well just look around you . \nIf you assume for a second that the so called `` allies '' of the U.S. or even the members of the so called security council are allied with the U.S. by choice , then you are gravely mistaken . \nThese countries under different circumstances would turn against the U.S. in a heartbeat . \nThe main culprit of our present global design is the great Winston Churchill . \nThe entire middle east and Africa was carved out in London ... . \nremember the Sykes Picot Agreement of 1916 ? \nThink Lawrence of Arabia , General Allenby , Prince Faisal I of Arabia -LRB- not Saudi Arabia ... and you wonder why the west till this very day have a `` close '' relationship with the Faisals of Saudi Arabia . \nWhile this is not a lesson on history , my point is to remember that none of this is new ... . \nempires go to Deathistan to DIE ! \nWhat a relief -- finding a blog and commentary where people can spell . \nIt 's a tricky proposition , ending participation in an entire slice of the world . \nIt is hard to imagine a way to stop military outcomes unless you do that . \nMind you , a little more honesty on the political scene could be helpful , and might help international folk gain a better understanding of just where the US of A sits in all this . \nHow about a robust discussion at Presidential level , on the value and application of democracy , regime change , parallel societies , energy , power and Oil Wars ?

'' \nPaul said he wanted the Senate to endorse Obama 's past words and thus establish that the president had overreached in authorizing the U.S. action in Libya last month without first obtaining Congress ' approval . \nPaul 's proposal was `` too cute by half , '' declared Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday after she joined other senators in voting to table it , 90-10 . \nPaul had trouble getting even his fellow Republicans to support his idea . \nSome said they did n't approve of where he had chosen to offer his war powers amendment -- on legislation to do with small businesses . \n`` I think we need to address Libya , when -LRB- that 's -RRB- the focus , '' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican , after the vote . \nObama briefed leading members of Congress the day before launching attacks on Libya last month , but did not seek debate or vote in Congress , as some lawmakers say he should have . \nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war . \nBut Article 2 says the president is `` Commander in Chief '' of the armed forces . \nThis has been a source of friction between the two branches for decades . \n`` I am amazed that this body does not take the time to debate whether we should be in Libya , '' Paul said on the Senate floor Tuesday . \n`` Some say we 'll debate it next week . \n... The debate should occur before we go to war , '' Paul told senators . \nIndeed , leading senators have been discussing for days whether to retroactively authorize U.S. military intervention in Libya . \nBut they have n't been able to agree on a draft text . \n`` We do n't know yet -LRB- whether there will be a resolution -RRB- . \nWe 're just discussing it informally , '' said Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , a Democrat who has been supportive of the Libyan intervention . \n`` I think there should be an expression from Congress '' about the war , the Senate 's number two Republican , Jon Kyl , told reporters . \n`` The problem has been getting a consensus on what that is . \nIt has n't been easy . '' \nKyl said Republican Senator John McCain , a supporter of the Libya war , was trying to get agreement with Democrats . \nThe House has been waiting to see what the Senate would do , But some lawmakers , like House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard McKeon , a Republican , doubt the House could pass a resolution now that would approve the operation . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt is time to boot these incompetant elite from office with a new constitutional convention . \nThe Congress is corrupt and can not be repaired . \nThe cronies of the elected congress people are CBA -LRB- Crooked Bankers Association -RRB- that bailed out AIG crooks for $ 180 BILLION and then eliminated the transparency by hiding the $ 263 TRILLION derivative debt from the American taxpayers . \nRand Paul is loved by the tea baggers so does the tea party care more about Libya then small businesses ? \nI think the senate should take care of more pressing issues then worrying about the past -- are we really at war if we do n't put troop on the ground and do n't try to take out the leader ? \nAlso , this was an international effort put forth by the UN Once again all talk and no substance . \nPand Paul did vote for the action in Libya on 3-1 , thats on record and he can not hide from that . \nUnanimous consent is still a vote in the senate . \nAs a fact , most votes in the senate is by unanimous and only when a senator wants to debate or stall or object are there members on the floor to further discuss it . \nSentor Rand Paul could of even put on hold on the resolution if he wanted to but he did n't . \nIn other words , Rand Paul is no different than the rest but now the elections are near and the power grab is coming to head . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn reaction , NATO said it was carrying out its mandate . \nNATO took over from a coalition led by the United States , Britain and France on March 31 , putting the alliance in charge of air strikes targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure as well as policing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo . \nNATO had been moving very slowly , allowing Gaddafi forces to advance , Younes said , adding rebels were considering referring the issues with NATO to the U.N. Security Council which authorised its mission . \n`` NATO has become our problem , '' he said . \nA rebel spokesman said Misrata was hit again on Tuesday . \n`` Misrata was shelled with tank fire , artillery and mortars , '' the rebel , called Abdelsalam , told Reuters , adding : `` Unfortunately NATO operations have not been effective in Misrata . \nCivilians are dying every day . '' \nStalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages has prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war in this oil-producing North African desert state . \nProtests against the government that began on February 15 swiftly descended into civil war after Gaddafi forces opened fire on demonstrators . \nHe then crushed uprisings in Libya 's west , leaving the east and Misrata in rebel hands . \nNATO-led air power is holding the balance in Libya , preventing Gaddafi forces from overrunning the rebels but unable for now to hand them outright victory . \n`` Either NATO does its work properly or I will ask the -LRB- rebel -RRB- national council to raise the matter with the Security Council , '' Younes , a former interior minister in Gaddafi 's administration who defected , told reporters . \n`` The reaction of NATO is very slow . \nOne official calls another and then from the official to the head of NATO and from the head of NATO to the field commander . \nThis takes eight hours , '' Younes said , adding : `` Misrata is being subjected to a full extermination . '' \nAsked about Younes 's remarks , NATO spokesman Oana Lungescu said : `` The facts speak for themselves . \nThe pace of operations since NATO took over has not abated . \nWe have conducted 851 sorties in the past six days ... we are fulfilling our mandate . '' \nAnother NATO official said : `` The rebels may not see us . \nWe may be 100 or 150 km away . \nWe are some distance from where the fighting is going on so the rebels are not aware . '' \nEarlier in the day , NATO had given details of the campaign . \n`` The assessment is that we have taken out 30 percent of the military capacity of Gaddafi , '' Brigadier General Mark van Uhm , a senior NATO staff officer , said in Brussels . \nOver the last day , air strikes around Misrata hit Gaddafi 's tanks , air defense systems and other armored vehicles . \nNear Brega in the east , where intense fighting raged for a sixth day on Tuesday , NATO aircraft struck a rocket launcher . \nAnswering earlier criticism by insurgents that air power was less effective with the alliance in control , NATO officials said the presence in Libyan skies was undiminished . \nVan Uhm said Gaddafi was using civilians as human shields and hiding his armor in populated areas , curbing NATO 's ability to hit targets . \n`` The operational tempo remains , but we have seen a change of tactics -LRB- from Gaddafi -RRB- , '' he said . \n`` When human beings are used as shields we do n't engage . '' \nAddressing NATO , Younes said : `` They say they do n't want to bomb in order not to kill civilians . \nThe area where Gaddafi troops are does not include civilians . '' \nAbdelsalam in Misrata agreed . \n`` NATO says Gaddafi 's forces are hiding among civilians . \nBut we tell them that there are no civilians left in the areas where the Gaddafi forces are positioned . \nWe urge them to destroy civilian property to take out the snipers and armed gangs . '' \nAfter a series of rapid rebel advances followed by headlong retreats , the insurgents held their ground for six days in Brega , putting their best trained forces in to battle for the oil town and keeping the disorganised volunteers away . \nA sustained government bombardment of rockets and mortar bombs , however , pushed the insurgent pick-up truck cavalcade back toward the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , their biggest retreat in several days of inconclusive battles . \n`` Since the day NATO took over the air strikes , we have been falling back , '' said Ziad el Khafiefy , 20 , a rebel fighter , echoing Younes 's comments . \n`` Gaddafi 's troops are hitting us with Grad missiles , '' said Mabrouk el Majbary , 35 . \n`` Something is wrong ... When the U.S. gave leadership to NATO , the bombings stopped .

'' \nThe rebels had shown better organization than in past weeks , keeping territory for longer but government troops mounted a sustained assault on Tuesday . \nThe rebels are set for a boost with the arrival of a tanker in one of their ports which can carry one million barrels of crude , worth more than $ 100 million , which would be their first shipment since the fighting broke out . \nA Turkish ship arrived at the port of Cesme in western Turkey on Tuesday afternoon carrying 321 injured Libyans after visiting Benghazi and Misrata . \nSirens wailed as ambulances rushed the injured to nearby hospitals . \nIn the capital Tripoli , angered by fuel shortages and long queues for basic goods caused by sanctions and air strikes , some residents began openly predicting Gaddafi 's imminent downfall . \nStepping up efforts to eradicate symbols of resistance against Gaddafi in western Libya , the army razed a mosque once used by rebels as a command center in Zawiyah . \nThe government took reporters to the city to show it was under control . \n`` People are upset , '' said Mohammad , a shopowner . \n`` How can you remove a mosque in a central square just like that ? \nIt 's a Muslim country . '' \n`` Do n't you see how tightly controlled we are now . \nGovernment spies have us surrounded in this city and we are scared to talk , '' said another resident . \n`` Those were revolutionaries and civilians that they killed , they were not gangs or al Qaeda . '' \nStalemate on the frontline of fighting in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's circle and the plight of civilians caught in fighting or facing food and fuel shortages prompted a flurry of diplomacy to find a solution to the civil war . \nThe government has offered concessions . \nSpokesman Mussa Ibrahim said Libya was ready for a `` political solution '' with world powers and offered a `` constitution , election , anything . \nBut the leader has to lead this forward . '' \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi ended a diplomatic shuttle to Greece , Turkey and Malta to set out the government position . \nLibya 's Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , once a close ally of Gaddafi , has defected to Britain . \nTurkey is expecting an envoy to visit from the opposition in the coming days and is listening to both sides . \n`` Both sides have a rigid stance , '' a Turkish Foreign Ministry official said after Obeidi 's visit . \n`` One side , the opposition , is insisting that Gaddafi should go . \nThe other side is saying Gaddafi should stay . \nSo there is no breakthrough yet . '' \nThere has been talk of Gaddafi staying on as an historic figurehead with one of his sons overseeing a change in Libya towards democracy . \nBut many Western leaders see no role for Gaddafi in Libya 's future . \n`` But let 's be clear , when Gaddafi leaves , that is when the real difficulties start and we need to prepare for that , that is bringing the country together again , '' said Sweden 's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt , who was involved in the Balkans conflict . \n"}

'' \nAs Gaddafi clings to power despite five months of civil conflict and a lengthening NATO bombing campaign , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement to the Libyan conflict . \nWhile the United States , NATO 's dominant military power , is hoping that talks can gain traction , it along with the rebels that now control roughly half of Libya insists Gaddafi must go . \nIbrahim said Libyan officials but not Gaddafi himself would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels . \nBut such talks will only take place on the government 's terms , he said , as it urges them to put down their arms and rejoin the Gaddafi camp . \n`` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' Ibrahim said . \nGaddafi is urging Libyans , however , to persuade rebels to disarm and to fight them if they do n't . \nThe comments came as the Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of recent fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water pipeline plant . \nThe report could not be immediately verified . \nAs Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts to foster an exit from the conflict , a European diplomat said that a U.N. envoy will seek to persuade warring parties in Libya to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power-sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi . \nThe diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times . \nKhatib , a Jordanian senator , told Reuters in Amman he hoped both sides would accept his ideas . \n`` The U.N. is exerting very serious efforts to create a political process that has two pillars ; one is an agreement on a ceasefire and simultaneously an agreement on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period , '' he said . \nHe did not go into the details of that mechanism . \nPoorly armed rebels seem unlikely on the cusp of the Islamic holy month to quickly unseat Gaddafi , who came to power himself as a young revolutionary influenced by Egypt 's Gamal Abdel-Nasser . \nThe rebels declared advances this week but they also suffered losses near their stronghold of Misrata and in fighting for Brega . \nOn Thursday rebels said minefields slowed their advance on Brega -- which they had earlier claimed to have all but captured -- but that they had pushed closer to Zlitan , on the Mediterranean coast 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . \nA rebel spokesman near Zlitan called urgently for help for people in nearby Souk al-Thulatha who joined the rebels but were now besieged by government forces . \n`` This is very dangerous for the course of the revolution , '' he wrote in an online posting . \nGaddafi has stepped up his defiant rhetoric amid persistent reports of talks . \nPro-government rallies are being shown almost daily on state television , perhaps a reminder to outsiders that he can still command considerable support . \nOn Friday , thousands of people gathered near Tripoli 's historic center to watch the unveiling of a massive likeness of the longtime leader . \nState television said Gaddafi would make another speech on Saturday , this time addressed to Egyptians on the anniversary of their revolution -- not this year 's , which toppled President Hosni Mubarak , but pan-Arabist Nasser 's in 1959 . \nDespite facing a rebel challenge and ostracized by much of the international community , the government remained potent , Ibrahim said . \n`` NATO , you are losing , you will lose , '' he said . \n`` The armed gangs in the western mountains and the east part of the country , you have no future -LRB- in the country -RRB- . \nIbrahim also denied a report from rebel foreign spokesman Ali Essawi that Mansour Daw , a key aide to Gaddafi , had been wounded in a rebel rocket attack on a meeting of Gaddafi 's inner circle in Tripoli on Thursday . \nIbrahim said there had been an explosion caused by a kitchen gas cylinder . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement are growing as Europe and the United States grapple with fiscal crises at home . \nThis week , France said for the first time that Gaddafi could stay in Libya as long as he gives up power . \nBut there is little evidence in Libya that either side is ready to make serious concessions . \n`` The first principle for Libyans is that Gaddafi should step down , and announce this and make this very clear . \nAfter that , we can talk about details , '' Essawi told reporters in Rome . \n`` Negotiations will be only on the departure of Gaddafi . \nWe will not negotiate on his staying in Libya or ruling the Libyans . '' \nIbrahim meanwhile reiterated that Gaddafi would not leave his position nor leave Libya on demands from rebels or from Complicating Gaddafi 's situation is the fact that the world court in The Hague which seeks his arrest over crimes against humanity allegedly committed by his forces , he added . \nAs the war in Libya drags on , the U.S. military is weighing options that may deepen its involvement in the conflict and its alliance with the rebels . \nA U.S. official told Reuters on Friday that the United States is considering a NATO request to send more Predator drones to Libya , as well as other surveillance aircraft . \nIt has also reopened a debate over arming the rebels , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nthis proposition is farce at its worst . \na unity government is an invitation to protracted civil war . \nno , qadaffi must go and the country must get a fresh start This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nRebels who cleared Gaddafi 's forces from Libya 's third-largest city Misrata after weeks of intense fighting have been trying to push westwards and take Zlitan , which would open the coastal road toward his Tripoli stronghold . \nThere have been two reports of Khamis 's death in the past six months : Arab media reported in March he had died in a kamikaze crash by a disaffected Libyan air force pilot . \nLibyan state television countered with pictures of a man resembling Khamis , which it said disproved the report of his death . \nThe government said earlier this year a NATO strike in Tripoli had killed Gaddafi 's son Saif al-Arab , who unlike Khamis did not have a high public profile or a major leadership role . \nGaddafi has kept control of the capital despite severe fuel shortages and rebel advances backed since March by Western air strikes , assault helicopter attacks and naval bombardments . \nThe rebels face numerous problems , from stalling battlefield momentum to internal splits , exposed starkly last week when military chief Abdel Fattah Younes was assassinated behind his own lines in circumstances yet to be explained . \nNear the capital , rebels also control the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli . \nA rebel official there , Colonel Juma Ibrahim , told Reuters his forces had set an ultimatum to the surrounded town of Tiji to surrender or face attack Saturday . \nRebels were using loud-hailers to appeal to a tribal chief close to Gaddafi to evacuate civilians from Tiji and broker the withdrawal of pro-Gaddafi forces . \n`` If he does not comply , we will attack , '' said Ibrahim . \n"}

'' \nAisha Gaddafi , a lawyer in her mid-30s about whom little information can be confirmed , was on the very point of giving birth when the family appealed to cross the border , another Algerian source said . \nThat humanitarian consideration was the main reason for them being allowed in , the source added . \nAlgeria 's ambassador to the United Nations , Mourad Benmehidi , told the BBC that in the desert regions there was a `` holy rule of hospitality . '' \nAnalysts say the government in Algiers is wary of popular unrest in other Arab states and fears its own Islamist enemies may find support in the new Libya . \nHowever , a local newspaper in Algiers reported that Algeria would hand over Muammar Gaddafi to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- if he himself entered the country . \nAnother paper said part of the Libyan border would be closed . \nGaddafi 's wife Safia and sons Hannibal and Mohammed were also in the party given refuge . \nLibya 's ruling council demanded them back for trial . \nBut only Gaddafi himself , his son Saif al-Islam and a senior aide , who are both also in unaccounted for , are subject to an international arrest warrant for war crimes . \nGaddafi 's only daughter who was not adopted , Aisha ran a charitable foundation and in 2004 joined a team of lawyers defending former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . \nThere had been no public announcement that she was expecting a child . \nAisha largely stayed out of Libyan politics , but since the start of a revolt against her father 's rule in February she appeared at pro-Gaddafi rallies and gave interviews in which she accused NATO of killing Libyan children . \nQuoting Algerian sources , the Echorouk newspaper said on its website that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika had told government ministers at a cabinet meeting on Monday Algeria would respect international law on all matters related to the Libyan conflict . \n`` Should Gaddafi try to enter Algerian soil ... Algeria would arrest him and hand him over to the International Criminal Court in compliance with international agreements , '' the newspaper said . \nIt said the decision was not a reaction to the toppling of Gaddafi but was in accordance with the ICC 's arrest warrants . \nNo one was immediately available from the government for comment . \nIn a separate report , Echorouk said Gaddafi 's family would not be allowed to go to the capital Algiers . \nAlgeria 's El Watan newspaper said the country was closing the southern part of its border with Libya . \nQuoting diplomatic sources , El Watan said an instruction had gone out to security services to close the southern part of the border with Libya because of the `` precarious situation '' there . \nAlgeria 's border with Libya is hundreds of kilometers long and stretches through expanses of empty desert . \nAlgerian officials say they are concerned that Islamist militants have infiltrated Libya 's National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- and that al Qaeda 's North African wing will exploit the chaos in Libya to acquire weapons and explosives . \nThe NTC has denied those charges and in turn accuses Algeria of siding with Gaddafi during Libya 's civil war , something the Algerian authorities deny . \n"}
{"id": "48", "time": "2011-08-30", "text": "CHICAGO | Tue Aug 30 , 2011 12:08 am EDT CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to fallen Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi committed a vast array of possible war crimes while battling rebels in Misrata , the country 's third largest city , according to a report issued on Tuesday by a U.S.-based human rights group . \nThe report by Physicians for Human Rights , titled `` Witness to War Crimes : Evidence from Misrata , Libya , '' is based on interviews of residents in the Misrata area conducted in June . \nThe authors say they provide evidence of `` murder , torture , rape , forced internment , and disappearance . '' \nThe group says Libya 's National Transitional Council must now move to prosecute people suspected of committing those crimes . \nA popular uprising in Libya in February against Gaddafi 's 42-year-old rule resulted in a civil war with rebels backed by a NATO bombing campaign from the air starting in March . \nMisrata was liberated by rebels in May after a fierce three-month battle , and they now control most of the country . \n`` The abuses that we gathered evidence of in Misrata are some of the most egregious war crimes and crimes against humanity I 've heard of in Libya , '' said Richard Sollom , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights and author of the report . \n`` There has been some evidence of crimes committed by rebel forces , but certainly nothing anywhere near as widespread and systematic as those committed by Gaddafi 's forces . '' \nA single act can be deemed a war crime , but when troops commit `` systematic and widespread '' crimes against civilians , that is a crime against humanity , Sollom said . \nAs evidence of one such crime , the report includes a copy of a government order for troops to prevent fuel and supplies reaching the city of some 400,000 to 500,000 people . \nThe crimes detailed in the report are also consistent with what residents told Reuters reporters in Misrata during the summer and with video evidence provide by a member of the new city council 's media committee . \nFor the report , the group focused on Misrata plus two towns immediately to the south of the city -- Kerzaz and Tomina -- which Sollom said were used as bases for Gaddafi loyalists during the government 's bombardment of the city . \nPeople interviewed for the report cited cases of torture , summary executions and allegations that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians , hospitals and mosques . \nThe report mentions the case of Mohammed , a civilian resident of the town of Kerzaz , who was left blind in one eye and suffered a broken jaw that he said he sustained while being tortured by government soldiers . \nVideo footage provided to Reuters shows at least one apparent rocket attack on a hospital , in which a room full of incubators for premature infants was hit . \nRebel fighters also showed a team of Reuters reporters in late July a mosque on Misrata 's western front in the town of Dafniya , which they said had been targeted by Gaddafi loyalists . \nThere were holes caused by tank and rocket fire on the west side of the mosque 's minaret -- indicating that government troops had inflicted the damage . \nAnd in interviews residents of Misrata told Reuters in July that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians . \n`` Gaddafi 's aim here was to kill as many people as he had to in Misrata in order to stay in power , '' said Fauzi al-Karshaine , a local businessman who was shot five time by Gaddafi troops on February 19 during a protest for greater freedoms by unarmed people in Misrata . \n`` He does not care how many innocent women and children he has to kill to do it .

{"id": "289", "time": "2011-02-24", "text": "Analysis : Revolt in Libya likely to scar its oil sector NEW YORK | Thu Feb 24 , 2011 10:24 am EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Regardless of what comes next in Libya 's lethal political standoff , the OPEC country 's oil sector is nearly certain to suffer , bringing long-lasting supply disruptions or even permanent damage . \nNone of several potential outcomes is benign for Libya 's oil industry -- the lifeblood of its economy -- or for oil prices . \nThe scenarios run the gamut from all-out civil war and attacks on energy infrastructure to low-level neglect and reservoir damage , as foreign expertise flees the country . \nOver decades , from Iran , to Iraq and Venezuela , periods of political chaos in OPEC countries have usually carved lasting scars on the oil sector , and few expect Libya to be any different . \n`` A period of chaos will probably interrupt Libya 's refining and oil operations , '' said Amy Jaffe , an energy studies fellow and Middle East expert at Rice University in Houston . \n`` The military is abandoning Gaddafi , so it 's unclear who is left to protect oil installations . \nLots of foreigners are being evacuated , so who will remain in place capable of operating Libya 's oil industry ? \nWill workers even show up ? '' \nAs Africa 's No. 3 producer and the site of the continent 's largest proved reserves , estimated at 44 billion barrels , Libyan oil usually accounts for 2 percent of world output . \nThe country , whose oil accounts for a fourth of Italy 's demand , is the first major oil exporter to be thrust into acute turmoil since protests began sweeping through the Middle East in January , unseating presidents in Tunisia and Egypt so far . \nAn estimated 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd of production has been halted , as companies evacuate staff and suspend operations , according to the latest Reuters calculations . \nMuch of the country 's oil industry is run by foreign firms including Eni and Repsol , while Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- has traditionally been tightly controlled by Gaddafi . \nLibyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi defiantly pledged on Tuesday to stay in power at any cost , threatening to have protesters hunted down and killed `` house by house . '' \nWith rival factions already laying claim to an oil-rich swath of eastern Libya , separated by hundreds of miles of desert from capital Tripoli in the west , the country could even face civil war , analysts warned . \nIn OPEC countries where oil infrastructure is the ultimate key to power and purse strings , war and other major political crises have typically resulted in supply disruptions that take years or decades to bounce back from . \nIran 's 1979 revolution cut the country 's output by more than half , and production never recovered fully . \nIraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait ultimately slashed output in both countries for years , and ravaged Kuwaiti oil wells . \nVenezuela 's massive oil industry strike of 2002 crippled production , which has never returned to pre-strike levels . \nTo be sure , OPEC 's top producer Saudi Arabia has stepped in to boost production in previous disruptions in other member producers , and the Saudi oil minister said on Tuesday the cartel , led by the kingdom , stands ready to pump more oil , but only when needed . \nU.S. officials say Saudi Arabia could replace Libyan supplies within a month , although it would leave less available spare capacity . \nLibya 's unrest has helped push Brent crude oil prices up nearly 6 percent since Friday , touching a 2-1\\/2 - year high of nearly $ 109 a barrel , although the surge also reflects the chance that chaos will affect other oil-exporting countries . \nBrent rose $ 2.64 to $ 108.42 a barrel on Wednesday . \n`` The output of -LRB- Libya 's -RRB- oil will probably not be completely halted , but it is difficult to see this level of chaos failing to result in significant operational disruptions , '' Eurasia Group analysts said in a note on Tuesday . \n`` It is likely that the country will experience a prolonged period of violent instability , with a potential for full blown civil war . '' \nAs the revolt aimed at ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule intensifies , oil infrastructure could enter the power play . \nUnlike in major African exporters Nigeria and Angola where oil is mostly offshore , installations are mostly on land in Libya , making them potentially more vulnerable . \n`` This effectively gives the country two political factions , two energy-producing basins , two oil output infrastructures . \nEconomically at least , the seeds of protracted conflict -- regardless of what happens with Gaddafi or any political changes after he departs - have already been sown , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor . \nWith oil companies scrambling to pull personnel from the country , Libya 's oil industry `` will have to operate under difficult circumstances . \nA sustained lack of security will keep foreign oil companies at bay for a while , '' said energy consultancy PFC in a note . \nAs yet , there are no reports of attacks on energy infrastructure , but eastern tribal leaders have threatened to shut off exports , revenue from which usually flows to capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's increasingly tenuous stronghold in the west . \nNearby , an underwater gas line to Italy has already been interrupted . \nThe fact that Libya is cutting exports of refined products may indicate workers are already abandoning the country 's refineries and their highly explosive plants out of fear . \nA Time Magazine intelligence columnist wrote on Tuesday that Gaddafi himself may be ordering sabotage attacks on oil pipelines leading to the Mediterranean Sea , citing a source in the region . \nAt Libyan oil wells , which are mostly in remote desert areas , any abrupt halt could permanently damage infrastructure and compromise it for years . \n`` Anybody who feels they could still control the infrastructure in the future will probably not try to blow it up , '' said Jaffe . \n`` But companies , including the Libyan national oil company , may face a tough decision . \nWill they try for orderly shutdowns that ensure production can resume easily later , or keep fields going but risk events that could damage them ?

{"id": "228", "time": "2011-02-24", "text": "Analysis : Gaddafi still has enough loyal forces for a fight LONDON | Thu Feb 24 , 2011 11:50 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi may have lost control of much of his country and military , but a hard core of troops will probably stay loyal as he tries to retain control of western Libya , the coastal strip and the capital Tripoli . \nMuch of the oil-rich east around Benghazi appears lost . \nTroops melted away in the face of popular protests inspired by the overthrow of rulers in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia , leaving it in the hands of people 's militias and tribal groups . \nBut so far Gaddafi 's opponents appear disparate and disorganized , with no centralized command and little prospect of mounting their own offensives . \nThat could leave the initiative in Gaddafi 's hands . \nAnalysts say he has always kept the wider military weak and disorganized , leaving real power in the hands of ultra-dedicated units often linked to his own tribal group . \n`` It 's always been kept deliberately nebulous , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . \n`` But I think it 's clear there are at least several thousand troops -- perhaps more -- who will remain loyal to Gaddafi and it 's reasonable to assume that any serious military equipment is likely to be in their hands . '' \nGaddafi has fomented confusion and rifts in any structure capable of posing a threat , said Jon Marks , a Libya expert and director of the Cross Border Information consultancy . \n`` It 's been divide and rule with the tribes , with political groups , with the regions , and above all with security , '' he said . \nGaddafi may also be relying on foreign fighters brought in from elsewhere in Africa . \nIn Benghazi , local people told Reuters they had captured several and were holding them in prison . \nThe Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights , citing reports from Libya exile groups , estimated there were up to 6,000 mercenaries , 3,000 in Tripoli and the rest across the country . \nOthers suggest those numbers may be vastly exaggerated . \nThere is little solid information on Gaddafi 's weaponry and equipment , dented by years of sanctions . \n`` It is mainly vintage 1950s , 60s and 70s kit , '' IHS Jane 's Middle East analyst David Hartwell said . \n`` Some tanks and armored personnel carriers and artillery . \nBasic stuff , but certainly lethal . '' \nThe opposition may also have some tanks and heavy weapons from units that defected , he said , but less in the way of spares and ammunition , less idea how to use it and currently no command and control structure . \nThat may change if defecting military commanders and tribal chiefs form new alliances . \nSome experts say army chief General Abu Bakr Younus Jaber , a comrade of Gaddafi in the 1969 coup that brought him to power , is believed to have sided with the rebels . \nMansour El-Kikhia , an expert on Libyan politics , estimated Gaddafi can call on 10,000-12 ,000 Libyan troops , split broadly between a 32nd Brigade led by his son Khamees , and a presidential guard that has been led by another son , Muatassim . \nThere are also armed members of his revolutionary committees , hardline political structures that enforce internal security and which are likely to stay loyal , if only from a sense of self-preservation . \n`` Since the 1970s he has drummed into them that their fate is tied to his , '' Kikhia said . \n`` For the past 40 years he has delegated the carrying out of many of the atrocities of the regime to these forces , deliberately to implicate them . \nHe has made sure they understood that they live or die with him . '' \nInformation from Libya remains sketchy at best , but the battle lines are slowly emerging of what increasingly looks like a Libyan civil war . \nGaddafi appears largely in control of Tripoli , after crushing protests there , while his opponents , though disorganised , have ousted him from the second city of Benghazi . \nThe situation along the coastal strip between the two cities is more confused . \nGaddafi 's home town Sirte lies in the middle , apparently under government control . \nFighting was reported in the port city of Misrata , 200 km east of Tripoli . \nIn other coastal towns , military forces have apparently been deployed to quell protesters . \nGaddafi seems to be trying to cement his control of western Libya , but analysts warned he was still far from safe in Tripoli where popular protests remain a potential threat . \nAnalysts said the air force is the only way he can hit back at opposition targets around Benghazi -- potentially including valuable oil installations . \nThat could be complicated by the arrival of a British frigate to evacuate foreign nationals . \nOn paper , his air force includes dozens of aircraft , mainly Russian-built jets with some 25 French-made Mirages at the start of the week . \nBut many are believed to be out of service and Libyan pilots have proved reluctant to strike opposition areas . \nTwo Mirage pilots defected to Malta earlier in the week and a Libyan newspaper said the crew of a third aircraft bailed out rather than bomb Benghazi . \nGaddafi is said to have hired foreign mercenary pilots in the past , but finding new crews may be hard . \nAny war will likely be low-tech and bloody , analysts say . \nThe good news is that Libya is believed to have given up and destroyed all stockpiles of chemical weapons as part of its rapprochement with the West . \nGaddafi must know that if he did use any such weapons against civilian targets , he would invite an overwhelming response from abroad . \nUnlike the World War Two tank battles in the north African desert , fighting in the current conflict is expected to take place in the towns . \n`` This will be urban , '' said one ex-military security expert now advising the oil sector . \n`` Just like Iraq . '' \nA lengthy Iraq-style conflict or descent into Somalia-style anarchy could provide fertile ground for Islamist radicals at a time of great change in Libya 's coastal neighbors . \n`` The consequences could be very bleak , '' said LSE 's Brahimi . \n`` But right now there does n't seem to be any appetite in the outside world to do anything to stop it .

'' \nOther foreign leaders , who also embraced Gaddafi , and his oil , after decades of isolating a leader who aided militants around the world , also voiced concern at the level of violence , which has included aerial bombing in parts of some cities . \nDifferences over how to proceed , some driven by concern not to jeopardize the safety of foreigners caught up in the trouble , appear to limit prospects for immediate , concerted international action , although some analysts have suggested that even military force might be applied to protect the rebel east from Gaddafi . \nFrance called outright for sanctions . \nObama said he would look at a `` full range of options . '' \nU.S. officials said sanctions were among those being considered . \nIn the eastern city of Benghazi , cradle of the uprising and home to tribes long hostile to the 68-year-old leader , thousands filled the streets , lighting fireworks and waving the red , black and green flag of the king Colonel Gaddafi overthrew in 1969 . \n`` We have been suffering for 41 years , '' said 45-year-old Hamida Muftah . \n`` Gaddafi has killed people ... We are a very rich country , but most of the people are poorer than poor . '' \nA medical official said about 320 had been killed in Benghazi since protests against oppression and poverty began last week . \nLibya 's Quryna newspaper quoted a military source as saying a bomber crew bailed out and left their aircraft to crash rather than bomb Benghazi . \nEarlier in the week , two pilots flew their planes to Malta to avoid , they said , attacking their own people . \nIn Tripoli , which remained largely closed to foreign media , local journalists said streets were calm after sporadic violence in recent days . \nGaddafi 's state television channel showed dozens of loyalists waving his portrait and chanting his praises . \n`` Lots of people are afraid to leave their homes in Tripoli and pro-Gaddafi gunmen are roaming around threatening any people who gather in groups , '' said Tunisian Marwan Mohammed , who was crossing the border home after leaving the Libyan capital . \nGaddafi 's children spoke up in defense of the man who went on television on Tuesday to fulminate against `` terrorists '' and promise to `` cleanse Libya house by house . '' \nThey also sought to tell viewers foreign media were misreporting the week 's events . \n`` Libyans are the victims of the biggest joke , '' his son Saif al-Islam , once seen as a reformer , told state television . \n`` So wake up . \nThe truths start today . \nYou will see it with your own eyes , tomorrow and after tomorrow . '' \nAnother son , former professional footballer Saadi , told the Financial Times that Saif al-Islam was drafting a constitution to `` bring in new blood to govern our country , '' adding : `` My father would stay as the big father who advises . '' \nHe acknowledged aircraft bombed areas around Benghazi but said they hit only bases to prevent Islamist radicals seizing arms . \nHe said his father would regain control of the east : `` When the people see the army , they will be afraid . '' \nGaddafi 's daughter Aisha also appeared on state television , denying a report she tried to flee to Malta . \n`` I am steadfastly here , '' she said . \nShe added she was unaware of a report she had been dropped by the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador . \nOthers have deserted Gaddafi 's side , however . \nInterior Minister Abdel Fattah Younes al Abidi and a senior aide to Saif al-Islam joined them : `` I resigned from the Gaddafi Foundation on Sunday to express dismay against violence , '' Youssef Sawani , executive director of the foundation , told Reuters by SMS . \nGaddafi has deployed troops to the west of the capital to try to stop the revolt that started in the east from spreading . \nIn the east , many soldiers have withdrawn from active service . \nGeneral Soliman Mahmoud al-Obeidy told Reuters in Tobruk in the east that the Libyan leader was no longer trustworthy . \n`` I am sure he will fall in the coming days , '' he said . \nOil prices climbed above $ 111 a barrel at their highest since mid-2008 amid fears chaos could spread to other oil-producing countries and choke supplies , which could dash hopes of a quick global economic recovery . \nTrade sources said at least three oil cargoes did make it out of Libyan ports over the 24 hours to mid-Wednesday , however . \nUp to a quarter of Libya 's oil production has been closed down , based on calculations from firms in the country , which stretches from the Mediterranean into the Sahara and supplies nearly 2 percent of world oil output . \nCountries with strong business ties to Africa 's third largest oil producer scrambled to evacuate thousands of citizens and a Turkish worker was shot dead at a building site near the capital , Turkish officials said . \nA British oil worker said 300 people were stranded at a camp in the east of Libya , where he said local people had looted oil installations . \n`` We are living every day in fear of our lives as the local people are armed , '' James Coyle told the BBC . \nAn estimated 1.5 million foreign nationals are working or traveling in Libya and a third of the population of 7 million are immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa . \nWitnesses described scenes of chaos as people tried to leave . \n`` It 's a biblical exodus , '' said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini , predicting several hundred thousand would seek refuge in Italy . \nThe U.N. Security Council condemned the use of violence and called for those responsible for attacks on civilians to be held to account . \nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron called for a formal resolution . \n`` The Libyan regime is using appalling levels of force and violence against its own people including using airplanes that are shooting at people , '' he said . \nBut in the latest sign of international division over how to deal with Gaddafi , the prime minister of Qatar said he did not want to isolate Libya , where several senior officials have declared their backing for protests that began about a week ago . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara , Christian Lowe , Marie-Louise Gumuchian , Souhail Karam , Firouz Sedarat , Tom Pfeiffer ; Brian Love , Daren Butler ; Dina Zayed , Sarah Mikhail and Tom Perry ; Janet Lawrence and Philippa Fletcher ; writing by Alastair Macdonald ; editing by Andrew Dobbie -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNot sure if the man actually knows what the word Martyr means . \na person who willingly suffers death rather than renounce his or her religion . \na person who is put to death or endures great suffering on behalf of any belief , principle , or cause : a martyr to the cause of social justice . \nDo n't quite think that a dictator trying to retain power meets either of those definitions . \nSeems the outcome of this one should be known ahead of time . \nThe same thing will happen here in the US when Obama loses in 2012 . \nOrganizing for America , NPR , Public Unions , and NAACP will fight to the death too claiming `` election fraud '' and `` Democracy '' . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nWithout giving precise details of his proof , Moreno-Ocampo said `` for these two crimes we have a lot of evidence .

'' \nThe Red Star One , sent by the International Organisation for Migration , picked up 800 people caught up in the civil war who had been waiting for days to escape Misrata 's worsening humanitarian crisis . \nIt had hoped to take 1,000 people . \n`` Hundreds of Libyan civilians had also tried to board the ship in desperation to get out of Misrata . \nBut with a limited capacity , the ramp of the boat had to be pulled up so that the ship could pull away from the dock in safety , '' the IOM said . \nThe shelling was also hitting Misrata 's Qasr Ahmad district , a mixed residential and industrial area which houses the iron and steel works in a city that has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the two-month conflict . \nAnother rebel spokesman , Abdelsalem , said the five killed were African migrant workers . \nHe said fighting was continuing in the southern neighborhood of al-Ghiran , where rebels say pro-Gaddafi forces have been trying to advance on the city center , and in Zawiyat al-Mahjoub to the west . \nThe port is a lifeline for Misrata , where food and medical supplies are low and snipers shoot from rooftops . \nOther rescue ships are offshore but there was no news of their movements . \nAbout 12,000 people have so far been rescued by 12 ships . \nMinesweepers from the NATO coalition , whose aircraft have been bombing Libyan government military targets under a United Nations resolution , had been searching the approaches to the harbor since Monday for a drifting Gaddafi forces ' mine . \nThe United States Wednesday condemned the continued shelling of Misrata and called on Gaddafi 's forces to permit the IOM to resume evacuating wounded people from the port . \nThe civil war over Gaddafi 's 41-year rule has split the oil-producing desert state into a government-held western area round the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by ill-disciplined but dedicated rebel forces . \nThe insurgents had hoped for a swift overthrow of Gaddafi . \nBut his better-trained and better-equipped forces halted the westward rebel advance from their stronghold of Benghazi and a standoff in the fighting has prevailed since then . \nThe United States , Britain and France , leading a NATO air campaign , say they will not stop until Gaddafi is toppled . \nInternational Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said he would request three arrest warrants for his investigation into the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators . \n`` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya . '' \nAt a U.N. Security Council meeting , Russia criticised the NATO campaign , saying it was using disproportionate force , and South Africa said the international court should also scrutinise the Western alliance for potential war crimes . \nNATO officers met Wednesday in Brussels to review their operation 's progress , rejecting assessments of stalemate on the battlefield despite their warplanes ' intervention , as nations prepared for a meeting in Rome Thursday over rebel finances . \nNATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the meeting a `` reaffirmation of the strong commitment to our operation , '' adding that he sensed no fatigue among the allies , while Gaddafi 's forces were weaker than when the NATO campaign began . \nGaddafi , who seized power in a 1969 coup , has not been seen in public since a NATO missile attack Saturday on a house in Tripoli , which Libyan officials said killed his youngest son and three grandchildren . \nOfficials said he was in good health . '' \n-LRB- The -RRB- best intelligence we have is that he -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- is still alive , '' CIA Director Leon Panetta told NBC News . \nLibyan state television said Wednesday that NATO forces bombed Al-Hayrah , west of the capital , causing casualties . \n`` The colonialist , crusader alliance has just bombed Al-Hayrah a short while ago , causing human casualties and damage to infrastructure , '' the broadcaster said . \nLibya 's army also fired volleys of rockets at the rebel-held town of Zintan in the Western Mountains , pressing on with a campaign that has forced thousands to flee the country . \nRebels said more than 40 Grad rockets hit Zintan late Tuesday . \nThe U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said an exodus from the Western Mountains region had resumed , with Libyan families fleeing into southern Tunisia . \n`` This past weekend , more than 8,000 people , most of them ethnic Berbers , arrived in Dehiba in southern Tunisia . \nMost are women and children , '' UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told a news briefing in Geneva . \nTens of thousands have already fled . \nWhile a few rebel pockets such as Zintan and Misrata resist Gaddafi 's forces in western Libya , in the largely rebel-held east the most pressing need is for cash . \nRebels say they expect up to three billion dollars in credit soon from Western governments to feed and supply their territories in the east . \nWith Libya 's economy in turmoil , funds to pay for food , medicine and the state salaries on which most people depend are running low . \nSecuring financing for rebels and facilitating contacts with defectors will be the focus of Libya talks in Rome Thursday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . \nJuppe told France 24 television the meeting of the so-called `` Contact Group '' on Libya , including Western and Middle Eastern countries , the United Nations , the African Union and the Arab League , would discuss setting up a financing mechanism . \n`` It 's not easy . \nThere are Libyan assets that are frozen and for legal reasons unfreezing them is difficult , '' Juppe said . \nJuppe said another aim of the Rome meeting would be to build contacts with defectors from Gaddafi 's government and officials who want to leave it . \n`` There are a lot of officials from Tripoli who want to talk . \nWe are going to try to coordinate , '' he said . \nThe revolt in Libya is the bloodiest yet against long-entrenched rulers across the Middle East and North Africa . \nThe Arab Spring has seen the overthrow of the veteran presidents of Tunisia and Egypt -- Libya 's western and eastern neighbors . \n"}
{"id": "38", "time": "2011-09-01", "text": "MOSCOW | Thu Sep 1 , 2011 5:45 am EDT MOSCOW -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Russia recognized Libya 's ruling interim council as the country 's legitimate authority on Thursday , moving to increase its influence on postwar reconstruction and protect its economic interests in the oil-producing North African nation . \n`` The Russian Federation recognizes the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- as the current authorities , '' the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website www.mid.ru . \nRussia , which was critical of NATO 's operation in Libya , announced its decision as leaders and envoys from world powers and international bodies gathered in Paris to coordinate Libya 's political and economic reconstruction . \nMoscow had billions of dollars worth of arms , energy and infrastructure deals with Libya under its deposed leader Muammar Gaddafi , and Russian officials have expressed concern they could be lost in the transition . \n`` We proceed from the position that all previously agreed treaties and other mutual obligations ... will be implemented in good faith , '' the Foreign Ministry said . \nRussia allowed Western military intervention in Libya to go ahead by abstaining from a U.N. Security Council resolution vote in March , but then repeatedly accused NATO forces carrying out air strikes of overstepping their mandate to protect civilians and of siding with anti-Gaddafi forces in the civil war . \nPresident Dmitry Medvedev , however , joined Western nations in urging Gaddafi to give up power and made clear he could not seek refuge in Russia . \nNonetheless , some in Libya have signaled that the new authorities could slight nations like Russia and China in favor of those that gave more support to Gaddafi 's foes . \nRussia 's representative at the Paris talks , Medvedev 's special Africa envoy Mikhail Margelov , said he was confident that would not happen . \n`` I do n't think the new government of Libya will start off by evaluating contracts with Russia on political rather than technical and economic criteria , '' the Interfax news agency quoted Margelov as saying . \nLast week , Medvedev called for talks between Gaddafi 's backers and opponents , and suggested that Russia would recognize the NTC if it was able to `` unite the country for a new democratic start . '' \nThe Foreign Ministry statement urged the council to carry out its `` declared reform program , which calls for the development of a new constitution , the holding of general elections and the formation of a government . '' \nRussia 's NATO envoy , Dmitry Rogozin , warned on Wednesday that unity among anti-Gaddafi forces would not last and said further Western military intervention was likely . \n`` As soon as the common enemy is defeated , the opposition will unavoidably meet with internal disagreements , '' Rogozin told Russia Today television . \n`` And I am certain that at that moment certain Western countries will try to provide themselves with a military presence in order to get control over Libya 's oil reserves . '' \nRussian companies Gazprom , Gazprom Neft and Tatneft have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in oil and gas exploration in Libya . \nState-run Russian Railways was building a high-speed railway from Sirte to Benghazi on Libya 's Mediterranean coast under a 2.2 billion euro -LRB- $ 3 billion -RRB- contract awarded during Gaddafi 's rule . \n"}
{"id": "299", "time": "2011-09-06", "text": "TRIPOLI | Tue Sep 6 , 2011 10:00 am EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Colonel Muammar Gaddafi 's regime was delivered by a caterer , on a memory stick . \nAbdel Majid Mlegta ran the companies that supplied meals to Libyan government departments including the interior ministry . \nThe job was `` easy , '' he told Reuters last week . \n`` I built good relations with officers . \nI wanted to serve my country . '' \nBut in the first few weeks of the uprising , he secretly began to work for the rebels . \nHe recruited sympathizers at the nerve center of the Gaddafi government , pinpointed its weak links and its command-and-control strength in Tripoli , and passed that information onto the rebel leadership on a series of flash memory cards . \nThe first was handed to him , he says , by Gaddafi military intelligence and security officers . \nIt contained information about seven key operations rooms in the capital , including internal security , the Gaddafi revolutionary committees , the popular guards -- as Gaddafi 's voluntary armed militia was known -- and military intelligence . \nThe data included names of the commanders of those units , how many people worked in each center and how they worked , as well as crucial details like the number plates of their cars , and how each unit communicated with the central command led by intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi and Gaddafi 's second son Saif al-Islam . \nThat memory card -- which Mlegta later handed to officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -LRB- NATO -RRB- -- provided the basis of a sophisticated plan to topple the Libyan dictator and seize Tripoli . \nThe operation , which took months of planning , involved secretly arming rebel units inside the capital . \nThose units would help NATO destroy strategic targets in the city -- operation rooms , safe houses , military barracks , police stations , armored cars , radars and telephone centers . \nAt an agreed time , the units would then rise up as rebels attacked from all sides . \nThe rebels called the plan Operation Dawn Mermaid . \nThis is the inside story -- much of it never before told -- of how that plan unfolded . \nThe rebels were not alone . \nBritish operatives infiltrated Tripoli and planted radio equipment to help target air strikes and avoid killing civilians , according to U.S. and allied sources . \nThe French supplied training and transport for new weapons . \nWashington helped at a critical late point by adding two extra Predator drones to the skies over Tripoli , improving NATO 's ability to strike . \nAlso vital , say western and rebel officials , was the covert support of Arab states such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar . \nDoha gave weapons , military training and money to the rebels . \nBy the time the rebels were ready for the final assault , they were so confident of success that they openly named the date and time of the attack : Saturday , August 20 , at 8 p.m. , just after most people in Tripoli broke their Ramadan fast . \n`` We did n't make it a secret , '' said Mohammed Gula , who led a pro-rebel political cell in central Tripoli and spoke to Reuters as rebels first entered Gaddafi 's Bab al-Aziziyah compound . \n`` We said it out on the street . \nPeople did n't believe us . \nThey believe us now . '' \nPlanning began in April , two months into the uprising . \nRebel leader Mahmoud Jibril and three other senior insurgents met in the Tunisian city of Djerba , according to both Mlegta and another senior official from the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , as the alternative rebel government calls itself . \nThe three were Mlegta , who by then had fled Tripoli and joined the rebels as the head of a brigade ; Ahmed Mustafa al-Majbary , who was head of logistics and supplies ; and Othman Abdel-Jalil , a scientist who became coordinator of the Tripoli plan . \nBefore he fled , Mlegta had spent just under two months working inside the regime , building up a network of sympathizers . \nAt first , 14 of Gaddafi 's officers were prepared to help . \nBy the end there were 72 , Mlegta says . \n`` We used to meet at my house and sometimes at the houses of two other officers ... We preserved the secrecy of our work and it was in coordination with the NTC executive committee . '' \nBrigadier General Abdulsalam Alhasi , commander of the rebels ' main operation center in Benghazi , said those secretly helping the rebels were `` police , security , military , even some people from the cabinet ; many , many people . \nThey gave us information and gave instructions to the people working with them , somehow to support the revolution . '' \nOne of those was al-Barani Ashkal , commander-in-chief of the guard at Gaddafi 's military compound in the suburbs of Tripoli . \nLike many , Ashkal wanted to defect , but was asked by the NTC to remain in his post where , Alhasi says , he would become instrumental in helping the rebels enter the city . \nThe rebel planning committee -- another four men would join later , making seven in all -- knew that the targets on the memory sticks were the key to crippling Gaddafi 's forces . \nThe men included Hisham abu Hajar , chief commander of the Tripoli Brigade , Usama Abu Ras , who liaised with some cells inside Tripoli , and Rashed Suwan , who helped financially and coordinated with the tribes of Tripoli to ease the rebels ' entry . \nAccording to Mlegta and to Hisham Buhagiar , a rebel colonel and the committee 's seventh member , the group initially drew up a list of 120 sites for NATO to target in the days leading up to their attack . \nRebel leaders discussed their idea with French President Nicolas Sarkozy at a meeting at the Elysee Palace on April 20 . \nThat meeting was one of five in Paris in April and May , according to Mlegta . \nMost were attended by the chiefs of staff of NATO countries involved in the bombing campaign , which had begun in March , as well as military officials from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . \nAfter presenting the rebels ' plan `` from A to Z '' , Mlegta handed NATO officials three memory cards : the one packed with information about regime strongholds in Tripoli ; another with updated information on regime sites as well as details of 65 Gaddafi officers sympathetic to the rebels who had been secretly supplied with NATO radiophones ; and a third which contained the plot to take Tripoli . \nSarkozy expressed enthusiasm for the plan , according to Mlegta and the senior NTC official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . \nThe leaders slimmed the 120 targets down to 82 and `` assigned 2,000 armed men to go into Tripoli and 6,000 unarmed to go out -LRB- onto the streets -RRB- in the uprising , '' according to rebel colonel Buhagiar . \nHe joined the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 1981 and has lived in the United States and trained as a special forces operative in both Sudan and Iraq . \nThere were already anti-Gaddafi cells in the capital that the rebels knew they could activate . \n`` The problem was that we needed time , '' the senior NTC official said . \n`` We feared that some units may go out into the streets in a spontaneous way and they would be quashed . \nWe also needed time to smuggle weapons , fighters and boats . '' \nIn the early months of the uprising , pro-rebel fighters had slipped out of Tripoli and made their way to the north-western city of Misrata , where they were trained for the uprising , rebels in Misrata told Reuters in June . \nThe leaders of two rebel units said `` hundreds '' of Tripoli residents had begun slipping back into the city by mid-July . \nCommander Alhasi and other rebel officers in Benghazi said the number of infiltrators sent into Tripoli was dozens , not hundreds . \n`` This was not D-Day , '' Alhasi told Reuters in his office . \nMost of the infiltrators traveled to Tripoli by fishing trawler , according to Alhasi . \nThey were equipped with light weapons -- rifles and sub-machineguns -- hand grenades , demolition charges and radios . \n`` We could call them and they could call each other , '' Alhasi said . \n`` Most of them were volunteers , from all parts of Libya , and Libyans from overseas . \nEverybody wants to do something for the success of the revolution . '' \nAlthough Tripoli was ostensibly under the control of Gaddafi loyalists , rebels said the security system was porous : bribery or other ruses could be used to get in and out . \nSmall groups of men also began probing the government 's security system with nighttime attacks on checkpoints , according to one operative who talked to Reuters in June . \nIt was possible to smuggle weapons into Tripoli , but it was easier and less risky -- if far more expensive -- to buy them from Gaddafi loyalists looking to make a profit before the regime collapsed . \nThe going rate for a Kalashnikov in Tripoli was $ 5,000 over the summer ; in Misrata the same weapon cost $ 3,000 . \nMorale got a boost when rebels broke into government communication channels and recorded 2,000 calls between the regime 's top leadership , including a few with Gaddafi 's sons , on everything from military orders to sex . \nThe NTC mined the taped calls for information and broadcast some of them on rebel TV , a move that frightened the regime , according to the senior NTC source . \n`` They knew then that we had infiltrated and broken into their ranks . '' \nRecordings of two of the calls were also handed to the International Criminal Court . \nOne featured Gaddafi 's prime minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi threatening to burn the family of Abdel Rahman Shalgham , a one-time Libyan ambassador to the United Nations and an early defector to the rebels . \nAl-Mahmoudi described Shalgham as a slave . \nThe other was between al-Mahmoudi and Tayeb al-Safi , minister of economy and trade ; the pair joked about how the Gaddafi brigades would rape the women of Zawiyah when they entered the town . \nSeveral allied and U.S. officials , as well as a source close to the Libyan rebels , said that around the beginning of May , foreign military trainers including British , French and Italian operatives , as well as representatives from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates , began to organize serious efforts to hone the rebels into a more effective fighting force . \nMost of the training happened in the rebel-held Western Mountains . \nBut Eric Denece , a former French intelligence operative and now Director of the French Center for Research on Intelligence , says an elite rebel force of fighters from the east was trained both inside and outside Libya , at NATO bases and those of other allies . \nThis `` overseas brigade '' was then dropped back into the country . \nIn all , estimated Denece , some 100-200 foreign operatives were sent to Libya , where they focused on training and military coordination . \nMlegta confirms that number . \nRebel commander Alhasi insists western special forces were not involved in combat ; the main help they gave was with the bombing campaign and training . \nLondon , Paris and Washington also say their troops were not involved in combat . \n`` They complied with our -LRB- bombing -RRB- requirements , immediately sometimes , sometimes we had a delay , '' said Alhasi , who has a big satellite photograph of Tripoli on one of his walls . \n`` We had the information on the ground about the targets and relayed it to them . '' \nA European official knowledgeable about such operations said `` dozens '' of plain-clothes French military advisers were sent to Libya . \nA French official said between 30 and 40 `` military advisers '' helped organize the rebels and trained them on basic weapons and more high-tech hardware . \nIn May , the French began smuggling weapons into western Libya . \nFrench military spokesmen later confirmed these arms drops , saying they were justified as `` humanitarian support '' , but also briefing that the aim was to prepare for an advance on Tripoli . \nBritish undercover personnel carried out some of the most important on-the-ground missions by allied forces before the fall of Tripoli , U.S. and allied officials told Reuters . \nOne of their key tasks , according to allied officials , was planting radio equipment to help allied forces target Gaddafi 's military forces and command-and-control centers . \nThis involved dangerous missions to infiltrate the capital , locate specific potential targets and then plant equipment so bomber planes could precisely target munitions , destroying sensitive targets without killing bystanders . \nIn mid-March , a month after violent resistance to Gaddafi 's rule first erupted , President Obama had signed a sweeping top secret order , known as a covert operations `` finding '' , which gave broad authorization to the CIA to support the rebels . \nBut while the general authorization encompassed a wide variety of possible measures , the presidential finding required the CIA to come back to the White House for specific permissions to move ahead and help them . \nSeveral U.S. officials said that , because of concerns about the rebels ' disorganization , internal politics , and limited paramilitary capabilities , clandestine U.S. support on the ground never went much beyond intelligence collection . \nU.S. officials acknowledge that as rebel forces closed in on Tripoli , such intelligence `` collection '' efforts by the CIA and other American agencies in Libya became very extensive and included efforts to help the rebels and other NATO allies track down Gaddafi and his entourage . \nBut the Obama administration 's intention , the officials indicated , was that if any such intelligence fell into American hands it would be passed onto others . \nA senior U.S. defense official disclosed to Reuters details of a legal opinion showing the Pentagon would not be able to supply lethal aid to the rebels -- even with the U.S. recognition of the NTC . \n`` It was a legal judgment that the quasi-recognition that we gave to the NTC as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people did n't check the legal box to authorize us to be providing lethal assistance under the Arms Export Control Act , '' the senior official said . \nIn some ways the rebels ' most unlikely ally was Qatar . \nThe Gulf Arab state is keen to downplay its role , perhaps understandably given that it is ruled by an absolute monarch . \nBut on the ground , signs abounded of the emirate 's support . \nThe weapons and equipment the French brought in were mostly supplied by Qatar , according to rebel sources . \nIn May , a Reuters reporter saw equipment in boxes clearly stamped `` Qatar . '' \nIt included mortar kits , military fatigues , radios and binoculars . \nAt another location , Reuters saw new anti-tank missiles . \nQatar 's decision to supply arms to the rebellion , one source close to the NTC told Reuters , was instigated by influential Libyan Islamist scholar Ali Salabi , who sought refuge in Qatar after fleeing Libya in the late 1990s . \nHe had previously worked with Gaddafi 's son Saif , to help rehabilitate Libyans who had fought in Afghanistan . \nSalabi 's brother Ismael is also a leader of a rebel militia in Libya . \nSalabi `` is the link to the influential figures in Qatar , and convinced the Qataris to get involved , '' said the source close to the NTC . \nBy early June , Libya seemed locked in a stalemate . \nAfter three months of civil war , rebels had seized huge swathes of territory , but NATO bombing had failed to dislodge Gaddafi . \nThe African Union said the only way forward was a ceasefire and negotiated peace . \nLondon joined Paris in suggesting that while Gaddafi must step down , perhaps he could stay in Libya . \nBut hidden away from view , the plan to seize Tripoli was moving into action . \nThe rebels began making swift advances in the Western Mountains , out of Misrata and around the town of Zintan . \nNewly arrived Apache attack helicopters operating from Britain 's HMS Ocean , an amphibious assault ship , were destroying armored vehicles . \nNATO aircraft dropped leaflets to dispirit Gaddafi forces and improve rebel morale . \n`` The game-changer has been the attack helicopters which have given the NTC more protection from Gaddafi 's heavy weapons , '' a French Defense Ministry official said . \nThe rebels ' foreign backers were eager to hasten the war . \nFor one thing , a U. N. mandate for bombing ran only to the end of September ; agreement on an extension was not guaranteed . \nOne U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters the main U.S. concern was `` breaking the rough stalemate before the end of the NATO mandate '' . \nThe Europeans were also burning through costly munitions and Washington was concerned about wear and tear on NATO allies ' aircraft . \n`` Some of the countries ... basically every deployable F-16 they had in the inventory was deployed , '' a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters . \nBut the momentum was shifting in the rebels ' favor . \nOn July 28 , the assassination of rebel military commander Abdel Fatah Younes proved a surprise turning-point . \nThe former Interior Minister had defected to the rebels in February . \nSome believe he had held back their advance from the east , for reasons that remain unclear . \nYounes ' death at the hands of his own men raised questions about the NTC and added impetus to NATO 's desire to push things along in case the anti-Gaddafi forces imploded . \nThe West forced NTC head Mahmoud Jibril to change his cabinet . \nNATO then took more of the lead in preparations , according to Denece , who said he has contacts within both French and Libyan intelligence . \nThere was another boon to the rebels . \nRegional heavyweight Turkey came out in support of the NTC in July , and then held a conference at which 30 countries backed them . \n`` The Turks actually were very helpful throughout this in a very quiet kind of way , '' said the senior U.S. defense official . \nWith the morale of Gaddafi troops eroding , the end was clearly near . \nMediocre at the best of times , Gaddafi 's fighters began fading away . \nSo too did his secret weapon : foreign mercenaries . \nAfter the uprising began , Gaddafi recruited several thousand mercenaries ; some formed the core of his best-organised forces . \nMost of the hired guns came from countries to Libya 's south such as Chad , Mali , and Niger , but some were from further afield , including South Africa and the Balkans . \nAmong them was a former Bosnian Serb fighter who had fought in Sierra Leone as a mercenary and later worked as a contractor in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nHired in March , first as an instructor and later as the commander of a 120mm mortar battery , the fighter , who used his nom-de-guerre Crni -LRB- `` the Black '' in Serbian -RRB- , told Reuters he had been paid regularly in cash in the western currency of his choice . \n`` I knew Libyans had poor discipline , but what I have seen was dismal in comparison with what we had in former Yugoslavia during our wars , '' he told Reuters . \n`` They were cowards , at least many of them . \nCommunications were the biggest problem , as they just could n't figure out how to operate anything more sophisticated than a walkie-talkie , so we resorted to cellphones , when they worked and while they worked . '' \nIt was in early August , he said , that `` everything started falling apart . '' \nThe force of which he was a part began retreating from a rebel onslaught . \n`` At some point we came under fire from a very organised group , and I suspect they were infiltrated -LRB- by -RRB- NATO ground troops , '' he said . \nThe loyalist units pulled back to a point about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli . \nBy mid-August , `` I decided it was enough . \nI took a jeep with plenty of fuel and water and another two Libyans I trusted , and we traveled across the desert to a neighboring country . \nIt took us four days to get there . '' \nForeign agents , meanwhile , were circulating far and wide . \nAt the Tunisia-Libya border in early August , a Reuters reporter ran into a Libyan with an American accent who identified himself as the head of the rebel command center in the Western Mountains . \nHe was accompanied by two muscular blond western men . \nHe said he spent a lot of time in the United States and Canada , but would not elaborate . \nAs the rebels advanced on Zawiyah , the Reuters reporter also saw western-looking men inside the Western Mountain region traveling in simple , old pickup trucks . \nNot far away , rebels in Nalut said they were being aided by CIA agents , though this was impossible to verify . \nOperation Dawn Mermaid was initially meant to begin on August 10 , according to Mohammed Gula , the political cell leader in central Tripoli . \nBut `` other cities were not yet ready '' , the leadership decided , and it was put off for a few days . \nA debate flared inside the Pentagon about whether to send extra Predator drones to Libya . \n`` It was a controversial issue even as to whether it made sense to pull -LRB- drones -RRB- from other places to boost this up to try to bring this to a quicker conclusion , '' the U.S. defense official said . \nThose who backed the use of extra drones won , and the last two Predators were taken from a training base in the United States and sent to north Africa , arriving on August 16 . \nIn the meantime , the rebels had captured several cities . \nBy August 17 or 18 , recalls Gula , `` when we heard that Zawiyah had fallen , and Zlitan looked like it was about to fall , and Garyan had fallen , we decided now is the time . '' \nThose successes had a knock-on effect , U.S. and NATO officials told Reuters . \nWith much of the country now conquered , Predator drones and other surveillance and strike planes could finally be focused on the capital . \nData released by the Pentagon showed a substantial increase in the pace of U.S. air strikes in Libya between August 10 and August 22 . \n`` We did n't have to scan the entire country any longer , '' a NATO official said . \n`` We were able to focus on where the concentrations of regime forces were . '' \nDays before the attack on Tripoli , the White House began leaking stories to TV networks saying Gaddafi was near the end . \nBut U.S. intelligence officials -- who are supposed to give an objective view of the situation on the ground -- were pushing back , telling journalists they were not so sure of immediate victory and the fighting could go on for months . \nThen , on August 19 , a breakthrough : Abdel Salam Jalloud , one of the most public faces of Gaddafi 's regime , defected . \nJalloud had been trying to get out for the previous three months , according to the senior NTC official . \n`` He asked for our help but because he wanted his whole family , not only his immediate one , to flee with him it was a logistical problem . \nHis whole family was around 35 . '' \nBy now , the mountain roads were under rebel control . \nThey took him and his family from Tripoli to Zintan and across the border into Tunisia . \nFrom there , he flew to Italy and on to Qatar . \nThe rebel leadership was ready . \nBut now NATO wanted more time . \n`` Once they got control of Zawiyah , we were sort of expecting that they would make a strategic pause , regroup and then make the push on into Tripoli , '' the senior U.S. defense official said . \n`` We told NATO we 're going to go anyway , '' said a senior NTC official . \nThe western alliance quickly scaled back its number of bombing targets to 32 from 82 , while rebel special forces hit some of the control rooms that were not visible , like those in schools and hospitals . \nThe signal to attack came soon after sunset on August 20 , in a speech by NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil . \n`` The noose is tightening , '' he said . \nA `` veritable bloodbath '' was about to occur . \nWithin 10 minutes of his speech , rebel cells in neighborhoods across Tripoli started moving . \nSome units were directly linked to the operation ; many others were not but had learned about the plan . \n`` We did n't choose it , the circumstances and the operations led us to this date , '' Alhasi told Reuters when asked why the uprising in Tripoli began then . \n`` There was a public plan in Tripoli that they would rise up on that day , by calling from the mosques . \nIt was not a military plan , not an official plan , it was a people 's plan . \nThe people inside Tripoli , they did this in coordination with us . '' \nIn the first few hours , rebel cells attacked installations and command posts . \nOthers simply secured neighborhoods , setting up roadblocks and impeding movement . \nShips laden with food and ammunition set off from rebel-held Misrata . \nRebel forces began pushing toward the capital from the Western Mountains and from the east . \nAccording to French newspapers , NATO cleared a path on the water by destroying pro-Gaddafi speed boats equipped with explosives . \nThe first rebel soldiers reached the city within a few hours . \nThe rag-tag army did n't look like much : some warriors wore football kit bearing the name of English soccer players . \nBut they encountered little resistance . \nOne rebel source said Gaddafi had made a fatal error by sending his important brigades and military leaders , including his son Mu'atassem , to secure the oil town of Brega . \nThe Libyan leader apparently feared the loss of the oil area would empower the rebels . \nBut it meant he left Tripoli without strong defences , allowing the rebels easy entry . \nThe air war was also overwhelming the regime . \nUnder attack , Gaddafi forces brought whatever heavy equipment they still had out of hiding . \nIn the final 24 hours , a western military official said , NATO `` could see remnants of Gaddafi forces trying to reconstitute weapons systems , specifically surface-to-air missiles '' . \nNATO pounded with them with air strikes . \nBy Sunday August 21 , the rebels controlled large parts of Tripoli . \nIn the confusion , the NTC announced it had captured Saif al-Islam . \nLate the following evening , though , he turned up at the Rixos , the Tripoli hotel where foreign reporters were staying . \n`` I am here to disperse the rumors ... , '' he declared . \nU.S. and European officials now say they believe Saif was never in custody . \nNTC chief Mahmoud Jibril attributes the fiasco to conflicting reports within the rebel forces . \nBut , he says , the bumbling turned into a bonanza : `` The news of his arrest gave us political gains . \nSome countries recognized us , some brigades surrendered ... and more than 30 officers defected . '' \nAs the Gaddafi brigades collapsed , the rebels reached a sympathizer in the Libyan military who patched them into the radio communications of Gaddafi 's forces . \n`` We could hear the panic through their orders , '' said the senior NTC official . \n`` That was the first indication that our youths were in control of Tripoli . '' \nAs the hunt for Gaddafi got underway , the NTC began implementing a 70-page plan , drawn up in consultation with its foreign military backers , aimed at establishing security in the capital . \nOfficials in London , Paris and Washington are at pains to say the plan is not based on the experience of Iraq or any other country , but the lessons of their mistakes in Baghdad are obvious . \nAt a press conference in Qatar , NTC head Jibril said Libya would `` rehabilitate and cure our wounds by being united so we can rebuild the nation . '' \nUnity was not hard to find during the uprising . \n`` The most important factor was the will of the people , '' commander Alhasi told Reuters . \n`` The people hate Gaddafi .

'' \n`` Our resolute Libyan people , the Libyan land is your own , '' said the 69-year-old who ran the country since he was 27 until two weeks ago . \n`` Those who try to take it from you now , they are intruders , they are mercenaries , they are stray dogs . '' \nBacking up his words , a cannonade of Grad missiles flew out of Bani Walid , a desert town south of Tripoli where a hard core of loyalists -- estimated by their opponents at about 150 -- are under siege by the new interim government . \nSome of its commanders suspect Gaddafi himself might be hiding inside . \nTwo of the defenders were killed and one of the siege force wounded in overnight skirmishing , though a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council said the new rulers would abide by a truce until Saturday to allow negotiated surrenders at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home town of Sirte , on the coast . \n`` We can do it within two hours maximum , '' Ahmed Bani said of taking over Bani Walid . \nHe said he believed Gaddafi 's son and heir-apparent Saif al-Islam was there , though he did not share the belief of some others in the NTC that his father was . \nReferring to the arrivals this week of senior Gaddafi aides in Niger , across the Sahara desert , which prompted speculation that could be an escape route , Bani said : `` He 's a fox . \nMaybe he wants us to believe that he 's out -LRB- of Libya -RRB- but he 's inside ... close to the border so that in an emergency he can escape . '' \nIn remarks which clearly indicated he was speaking after the reports from Niger were published , Gaddafi said : `` This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger . '' \nDespite the sweeping and sudden nature of their victory in Tripoli two weeks ago after six months of civil war , the new leadership is still struggling to impose its authority across the capital and the rest of the sprawling , oil-rich desert nation which is home to just six million people . \nThe stalemates around Sirte , Bani Walid and south into the desert town of Sabha -- all pro-Gaddafi bastions -- means the original rebel stronghold of Benghazi is still largely cut off from Tripoli , an 800-km -LRB- 500-mile -RRB- drive away to the west . \nNTC leaders have said they hope to be pumping oil again next week , and the new head of the central bank briefed the media on Thursday to assure Libyans and their foreign business partners that the bank had not been looted by fleeing members of the old regime . \nBusiness as usual was the watchword . \nIn another nod to getting down to government , the interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril was making his first appearance in Tripoli on Thursday since the uprising . \nBut there is still considerable doubt , contradiction and hesitation about moving the operations of the NTC from Benghazi to the capital . \nSome of that delay appears to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli may not be a safe place for every Libyan official , as potentially rival militias coalesce around the rebel brigades which swept in to the city from different towns and provinces , eager for a share of power that for 42 years was in the hands of one man only . \nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen assured Libyans the Western military alliance whose air power helped topple Gaddafi will keep up the pressure . \n`` NATO and our partners will continue the mission as long as the threat remains , but not a minute longer , '' Rasmussen said . \n`` Gaddafi and the remains of his machine must realize that there is nothing to be gained from more fighting . '' \nNevertheless , Western officials are keen to play down the extent to which they will -- or can -- help track Gaddafi down . \nThe U.S. ambassador to NATO , Ivo Daalder , said Gaddafi 's capture might not signal the end of the campaign : `` It is n't clear that if he were to be taken out that the whole thing would necessarily collapse ; we just do n't know that . \n`` We do know that if he does n't have the capability to pose a threat to civilians , then it does n't really matter . '' \nA diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , repeated alliance statements that NATO was not searching for Gaddafi and suggested its ground surveillance did not cover the south of Libya , which borders countries to which Gaddafi might flee . \n`` The operations plan that we adopted limited the area of operations to the coastal area , '' he said . \n`` It is very expensive and difficult to monitor the entire country , which is mostly desert and very big , '' he said . \n`` Since this was fundamentally about protecting people , rather than watching sands , this was where the resources were located .

Security Council , said he will request three arrest warrants within weeks for alleged crimes against humanity in Libya . \nMoreno-Ocampo is investigating Gaddafi , some of his sons and aides over what he called a `` predetermined plan '' to attack protesters , after the U.N. Security Council referred the Libyan violence to the ICC in February . \n`` Crimes against humanity have been and continue to be committed in Libya , attacking unarmed civilians -- including killings and persecutions in many cities across Libya , '' Moreno-Ocampo said in a statement . \nHe urged states to be ready to make arrests should an ICC judges issue the warrants , stressing `` now is the time to start planning on how to implement possible arrest warrants . '' \nMoreno-Ocampo gave no details on whose arrest he would seek . \nBut several U.N. diplomats and independent human rights experts said Moreno-Ocampo , whose probe of alleged genocide in Sudan 's Darfur region led to the indictment of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , might want Gaddafi 's arrest . \n`` We believe it is possible that Gaddafi could be included among the requested arrest warrants , '' said a spokeswoman in The Hague for the International Federation of Human Rights . \nMoreno-Ocampo said his request for warrants would be based on `` strong evidence , '' which he said would include photographs , video footage and the testimony of government insiders . \nThe ICC has no police force and relies on member states to enforce arrests . \nDespite NATO bombing operations intended to protect civilians , Libya has been plunged into civil war , seriously complicating efforts to arrest ICC suspects . \nLibya is not an ICC member state and is therefore not obligated to arrest the court 's suspects . \nSecurity Council powers the United States , Russia and China are not ICC members either , but voted in favor of referring Libya to the ICC . \nThe issue of enforcing ICC warrants is expected to come up at a meeting of a broad coalition of nations aligned against Gaddafi in Rome on Thursday , U.N. envoys told Reuters . \nRussian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin criticized the NATO-led airstrikes and urged members of the coalition to adhere strictly to Security Council resolution 1973 , which authorized `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . \nChurkin said Moscow was `` deeply alarmed '' by the growing number of civilian casualties in Libya . \nHe referred to the recent bombings in Tripoli , one of which killed Gaddafi 's son . \n`` Going beyond the mandate of 1973 in any way , and any disproportionate use of force , is unacceptable , '' he said . \nSouth African Deputy Ambassador Doctor Mashabane suggested NATO should not be immune from an ICC investigation . \n`` It is our sincere hope in considering the evidence , the office of the prosecutor will consider any actions that may have been committed in the purported implementation of resolution 1973 , '' he told the council . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe US , China and Russia are not members of the ICC and do not recognize its authority but voted to refer the matter to the ICC and ignore the Coalition 's targeting for assassination children in their homes . \nHow can a non-member have the right to vote ? \nThe Coalition used to be amusing but now are downright Pathetic Thugs . \nMany more will die from this so-called Bungled humanitarian intervention into the affairs of a sovereign nation for oil than if they had just declared a war or stayed out . \nThese Leaders do nothing but make a mockery of the UN and Peace . \nThis action , makes a mockery of the ICC , which I suspect , is the intention in the first place . \nHere we have the U.S. Administration ` ordering ' it 's military to committ extrajudicial murder from the air , infringing on another nations soveriegnity and murdering innocent men , women and children , destroying infrastructure of nations which have not lifted a finger against the U.S. yet not ONE official within the U.S. Administration , past or present , has ever been charged by the I.C.C. for the whole sale murder and mayhem that the U.S. unleashes on innocent people on a daily basis . \nEven the murder of OBL , which was against ever law ever written , and the I.C.C. utters not a word . \nSo who is it really , who is behind these charges emanting from the I.C.C. ? \nIt would seem , they pick their targets who invariably are always a thorn in the side of the U.S. Administration . \nOne could easily , therefore conclude , the I.C.C. is nothing but another tool of the N.W.O. doing the U.S. 's bidding , thus can not be relied upon as authentic body . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "64", "time": "2011-06-24", "text": "WASHINGTON | Fri Jun 24 , 2011 7:39 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A move to curb President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday , despite having the support of leaders of the majority Republicans . \nBut Obama was delivered a symbolic rebuke hours earlier when lawmakers refused another measure to formally authorize U.S. participation in the NATO-led Libya mission . \nThe twin votes starkly highlighted the ambivalence on Capitol Hill over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war . \nSome lawmakers argue that Obama violated the 1973 War Powers Act by failing to secure Congressional authorization after 60 days of hostilities , an argument the White House rejects . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said the administration was gratified the House had `` decisively rejected '' efforts to restrict funding for U.S. involvement in the operation , adding that it was important to keep up the pressure on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . \nThe measure would have allowed U.S. forces to continue providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO-led mission in the North African nation but would have barred them from carrying out both manned and drone air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces . \nSince NATO took over the Libya operation on March 31 , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes actually fired at targets . \nThirty-nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft . \nThe White House , however , expressed disappointment over the failure of the separate Democratic-backed measure that would have authorized the United States to continue its limited involvement in the Libya mission for a year . \n`` Now is not the time to send the kind of mixed message that it sends when we are working with our allies to achieve the goals that we believe are widely shared in Congress , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said . \n`` The writing is on the wall for Colonel Gaddafi and now is not the time to let up . '' \nThe congressional actions were another warning to Obama about growing discontent among lawmakers after a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . \nThe United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . \nThe U.N. authorized a no-fly zone and an arms embargo to put additional pressure on Gaddafi . \nThe mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . \nThe House , which is controlled by Republicans , voted 180-238 to reject the Republican measure to curb U.S. involvement in Libya . \nEighty-nine Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it . \nBoth House Speaker John Boehner and Representative Buck McKeon , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , had endorsed the measure . \nBoehner said the House was forced to act because Obama had failed to fulfill his obligation to consult with Congress . \n`` I support the removal of the Libyan regime ... , '' Boehner said . \n`` But when the president chooses to challenge the powers of the Congress , I , as speaker of this House , will defend the constitutional authority of the legislature . '' \nMcKeon said the measure would continue to provide NATO with the essential backing it needed to carry out the mission while helping `` the president to be truthful in saying that we 're not engaged in hostile action .

{"id": "29", "time": "2011-02-22", "text": "LONDON | Tue Feb 22 , 2011 2:10 pm GMT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Powerful military elites ultimately decided the outcome of Egypt and Tunisia 's revolutions , but in Libya it is the much more opaque and complex tribal power structures that could decide how events play out . \nColonel Muammar Gaddafi has long relied on his immediate -- but small -- Qathathfa tribe to staff elite military units and guarantee his personal security and that of his government , experts say . \nBut that is seen unlikely to be enough to secure the country . \nMore important are the larger tribes long co-opted into his rule such as the Wafalla , who make up an estimated 1 million of Libyan 's more than 6 million population . \nSome rumors suggest the ferocity of Gaddafi 's crackdown on his own people may already be prompting tribal leaders to switch allegiance . \n`` In Libya , it will be the tribal system that will hold the balance of power rather than the military , '' said Alia Brahimi , head of the North Africa program at the London School of Economics . \n`` I think you will see defections of some of the main tribes if that is not happening already . \nIt looks like he has already lost control of the east of the country where he was never popular and never fully managed to consolidate his power . '' \nEastern Libya is the site of much of its oil reserves . \nOn Tuesday , a Reuters correspondent reported that Gaddafi 's forces appeared to have abandoned their positions on the border with Egypt which were now in the hands of men armed with clubs and Kalashnikovs who said they were opposed to his rule . \nWho , if anyone , those men were answering to was not immediately clear . \nWhile herder and tribal lifestyles have declined in Libya in the face of rising oil-fueled urbanization , traditional power structures are said to remain strong beneath the surface . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia , the armies proved to be the supreme political force , easing unpopular leaders Hosni Mubarak and Ben Ali from office in part due to their reluctance to fire on protesters . \nLibya is very different , however . \nLong largely closed to outsiders , details of its complex mix of alliances and loyalties are scarce . \nExperts generally agree part of Gaddafi 's strategy for retaining power has been to keep his own tribe in important positions . \nKey members of his family are said to command their own military formations , again usually members of their own Qathathfa tribe . \nOnce largely nomadic herders , the Qathathfa were sidelined by Libya 's former monarchy but allowed to join the armed forces and police , then considered secondary organizations . \nHaving risen through the military structure himself , Gaddafi is seen to have tried to emasculate it to prevent rival commanders from threatening him . \nMemorably , he abolished all ranks above his own position of colonel . \nGaddafi 's unique `` Green Book , '' containing his political philosophy and system of government , vows to put an end to tribalism but in reality experts say it entrenched it . \n`` Gaddafi has largely dismissed the older tribal military structures but they will probably not have huge problems finding weapons , '' said the LSE 's Brahimi . \n`` Defections from the military will be key to this . '' \nParts of the military had long appeared reluctant to use excessive force against their own people , she said . \nPopular rumor held that Gaddafi was forced to rely on Serbian mercenary pilots to bomb civilian areas during offensives against Islamist militancy in the 1990s . \nSome say Gaddafi 's tribal strategy has effectively amounted to a system of divide and rule , buying off particularly established tribal leaders from key groups . \nIn recent years , they say , control has been faltering and recent events may accelerate this . \n`` Gaddafi made sure to keep the people aware of their tribal divisions , winning the alliance of larger ones and hence keeping the population under control , '' wrote Jerusalem-based journalist Lisa Goldman after a Skype conversation with a Libyan contact she said was well placed to talk on some military matters . \n`` Although the larger ones like the Werfalees and the Megrahees were privileged with power and money , his recent actions angered these tribes and for the first time in decades tribal barriers have withered away . \nPeople are uniting with other formerly rival tribes or even different ethnicities like the Amazeegh or Berbers . '' \nIf Gaddafi can persuade other tribes to stay loyal to him , most experts believe he will probably try to arm them directly , raising the risks of ethnic conflict that could tear the country apart , send refugees pouring into its neighbors and jeopardize oil supplies . \nGaddafi 's opponents accuse him of bringing in mercenaries from elsewhere in Africa , perhaps veterans of civil wars in the Sahel and West Africa . \n`` There 's a lot of weapons in the country and Gaddafi has armed tribes before that have supported him , '' said Geoff Porter , North Africa analyst and contributor to political risk consultancy Wikistrat . \n`` We could see something more along the lines of Lebanon 's civil war -- a prolonged period of violence and bloodshed .

Security Council permanent member Britain urged the African Union on Wednesday to send a strong message that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi must step down if civil war is to end in the North African state . \nBritain 's U.N. ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told the grouping it should subordinate its peace efforts in Libya to those of the United Nations and that there could be no cease-fire as long as Gaddafi remained in power . \nLyall Grant 's statement at a Security Council meeting with the AU came a day after South African President Jacob Zuma , who has visited Libya twice for the bloc to seek a solution to the conflict , said NATO military action there had gone too far . \nIn a speech to the council earlier on Wednesday , an AU representative called for an `` immediate humanitarian pause '' to allow relief supplies to reach Libyan civilians , followed by a cease-fire linked to political negotiations on a settlement . \nFollowing the speech by Mauritanian Foreign Minister Hamady Ould Hamady , the council and an AU delegation held a closed meeting where Lyall Grant defended NATO bombing of Gaddafi 's forces in pursuit of a council resolution calling for Libyan civilians to be protected . \n`` Gaddafi continues to launch attacks against his own people . \nSo long as he continues to do so , the coalition will take action to enforce the Security Council 's resolutions , '' Lyall Grant said in a text issued by Britain 's U.N. mission . \nSince the latest resolution was passed on March 17 , the United States , Britain and France have played a leading role in attacking Gaddafi 's troops fighting against rebels who hold the east of the country . \nLyall Grant said the AU had a `` central role '' to play in Libya peace efforts , but it must be `` coordinated with , and led by , the United Nations , '' under U.N. special envoy for Libya Abdelilah al-Khatib . \n`` It is important that parallel negotiation tracks do not open up , otherwise there will be a very real risk that Gaddafi will seek to exploit any perceived divisions in the international approach , which could inadvertently prolong the conflict , '' he said . \n`` Many African countries ... recognize the need for Gaddafi 's departure . \nWe hope that this can translate into a strong message from the African Union to the regime . '' \nLyall Grant , whose audience included South African Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane , made no direct reference to Zuma , whose last visit to Libya late last month was inconclusive . \nZuma has said Gaddafi wants an end to NATO bombing as a prelude to talks , terms the rebels reject . \n`` It is clear that a cease-fire with Gaddafi in place would not be credible , '' the British envoy said . \n`` Gaddafi has already declared a number of ceasefires , and he has broken every one of them . '' \nSince March , the Security Council has lost unanimity over Libya . \nPermanent members Russia and China believe , like Zuma , that the NATO bombing has exceeded the authority given by the resolution and aims at regime change in Libya . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe key risk for the world economy is a sustained rise in the price of oil . \nBut after shooting up to close to $ 120 a barrel in intraday trade on Thursday , Brent crude futures ended the day at less than $ 112 , showing just how fraught investors nerves are . \nThe sharp fall came after market rumors that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had been shot dead and on news that top producer Saudi Arabia could cover any supply disruptions . \nOn Friday , Brent crude was trading around $ 112 . \nU.S. crude futures eased to $ 97.60 from a Thursday high of $ 103.41 . \nIn Libya , forces loyal to Gaddafi hit back in fierce gun battles with rebels holding towns near the capital but there were no signs they had broken the opposition momentum . \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -LRB- OPEC -RRB- has an estimated 4-6 million barrels per day of spare crude production capacity , more than enough on paper to cover Libya 's output of 1.6 million barrels a day . \nBut markets are worried that the unrest might spread to bigger producers in the region that would have a much bigger impact on the world economy . \nAfter public uprisings have already toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia , governments in the region are taking notice . \nSaudi Arabia this week unveiled a $ 37 billion package to try to insulate the kingdom from the wave of protests across the Arab world , while Algeria lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency as it tried to appease opposition groups . \n`` When you start adding the potential number of barrels at stake , you can see why the market is tense and would rather be long oil than short , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , chief commodity strategies at BNP in London . \nDeutsche Bank said oil above $ 120 a barrel would be an inflection point for global economic growth . \nAt that price , oil as a share of global GDP starts to move above 5.5 percent , historically a point where global growth has come under pressure . \nAirlines are feeling the brunt of high oil prices as reflected in sharp falls in stock prices . \nChinese flag carrier Air China Ltd has dropped 14 percent this week . \n`` Unfortunately , oil prices have been rising like mad recently , '' said Li Jiaxiang , head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China . \nEmerging Asia , which led the world 's recovery from the global financial crisis , is already trying to deal with escalating food prices . \nHigher oil prices will add to the dilemma for policymakers of how to contain inflation and support economic growth . \nYet another complication is that while the crude price spikes this week reflect a supply-side risk , oil prices were already rising as economic activity around the world picked up pace . \n`` The global recovery is ongoing , it is gaining more traction but the developments in the crude-oil sector as a result of the turmoil in the Middle East is putting to question the strength of that recovery , '' said Jose Mario Cuyegkeng , economist at ING in Manila . \nSince most countries have little control over the world price of oil , raising interest rates would not address the issue for their economies . \nBut higher fuel prices could feed through to other prices , such as transport , and inflation expectations . \n`` The environment influencing inflation is now much more difficult than what we had expected at the end of last year , '' said Yim Jong-yong , South Korea 's vice finance minister . \nIndonesian central bank deputy governor Hartadi A.

'' \nKanshil estimated loyalist forces in Bani Walid at around 600 men , more than previous estimates . \n`` People are very afraid , that is why we have to go in , '' he said . \nTroops were still hoping to avert `` full-scale war '' and had entered Bani Walid without orders from central NTC command . \nOne NTC fighter had been killed so far and four wounded in Bani Walid while three Gaddafi fighters were killed and three wounded , Kanshil said . \nSeven Gaddafi loyalists were captured . \nReuters reporters near both towns said volleys of Grad rockets had been fired by Gaddafi loyalists at NTC fighters earlier in the day . \nAmbulances streamed back and forth with casualties from near Bani Walid , and NTC fighters grabbed crates of rocket-propelled grenades and mortars and raced to the front . \nSmoke rose from the frontline and NATO warplanes roared overhead . \nOfficials at the National Transitional Council 's Tripoli military headquarters told Reuters that between 100 and 150 vehicles had set off into the desert for Sabha on Friday . \nMore would leave in convoy later in the day and into Saturday . \n`` There are people going from Jadu , from Zintan , from Tripoli , there is a mixture , '' NTC fighter Abu Aziz Selem told Reuters as he rushed out of the capital with a Kalashnikov assault rifle slung over each of his shoulders . \nFamilies trickled out of Bani Walid before the fighting intensified , belongings crammed into their cars . \n`` I 'm taking my family away from war , '' said Khalid Ahmouda , stopping his car briefly to speak to Reuters . \n`` They are afraid because there will be a big fight today or tomorrow . '' \nHis veiled wife , Oum Abdurahman , leaned from a window , holding her baby son . \n`` There 's no power , no food , no water . \nMany people want to leave but have no fuel for their cars and Gaddafi forces are preventing people from leaving , '' she said . \n`` They fire in the air to terrorise people . \nToday we managed to leave , '' she said , adding her brother-in-law was among 11 people killed in a May 25 crackdown on anti-Gaddafi protests . \nNTC officials at a checkpoint 30 km from Bani Walid said Gaddafi fighters had been captured . \nReuters witnesses saw some men driven away with their hands tied behind them , as well as two bodies , said to be Gaddafi fighters , in a pick-up truck . \nMuammar Gaddafi 's location is still a mystery . \nIn a defiant message broadcast on Thursday though , he said he was still in Libya to lead the fight against what he called `` rats '' and `` stray dogs '' who had taken over the capital . \nInterpol issued arrest warrants for him , his son Saif al-Islam and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi , all wanted by the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- for war crimes . \nFour top officials , including Gaddafi 's air force commander and a general in charge of his forces in the south , were among a new group of Libyans who have fled to neighboring Niger , officials in Niger said . \nNiger said it would respect its commitments to the Hague-based international court if Gaddafi or his sons arrived , but had accepted the lower-ranked officials as a humanitarian case . \n`` We are signatories of the -LRB- ICC 's -RRB- Rome Statute so they know what they are exposed to if they come , '' said the head of President Mahamadou Issoufou 's cabinet , Massaoudou Hassoumi . \nMost residents of Sabha , Bani Walid and Sirte are trapped and awaiting either a final battle or a surrender . \n`` We are not seeing many people leaving . \nHow can they ?

{"id": "287", "time": "2011-09-07", "text": "TRIPOLI | Wed Sep 7 , 2011 10:10 am EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A major Western defense firm was upgrading military equipment for an elite Libyan security brigade just before an uprising against Muammar Gaddafi , documents show , showing how the West tried to foster ties with him during his final years in power . \nLess than a month before the start of the revolt , the British arm of U.S.-based General Dynamics was making arrangements to improve communications systems for tanks , artillery and armored troop carriers for the Khamis Brigade , which played a lead role in cracking down on the revolt , according to documents found by Reuters at a brigade base . \nGeneral Dynamics said the upgrade was never completed . \nBut the documents illustrate in detail for the first time what weapons were involved in the deal and that the firm was doing business with Gaddafi 's forces on the eve of the uprising . \nIt said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya -- an 85 million pound -LRB- $ 136 million -RRB- deal to provide a tactical communications and data system as part of what it termed at the time `` the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya . '' \nThis was after Gaddafi , widely ostracized abroad for much of his 42-year rule because the West accused him of supporting terrorism , abandoned his program of mass-destruction weapons in 2003 , returning Libya to mainstream international politics . \nThe Khamis Brigade , led by and named after one of Gaddafi 's sons , was the best equipped of Libya 's security forces and was directly involved in putting down the uprising in cities such as Misrata and Tripoli , where thousands of people were killed . \nPeter Bouckaert , emergencies director with Human Rights Watch , said the brigades commanded by Khamis , and another Gaddafi son , Mutassim , were able to become so strong thanks in part to procurement from Western countries . \n`` These elite brigades ... had access to the most modern weapons , '' he said . \n`` We 've documented arms sales from not just the usual suspects but also Western companies . \n`` I think the lesson is that if you 're going to sell weapons to dictators , at some point down the line you 're going to be deeply embarrassed . '' \nA letter from a General Dynamics UK project manager , Simon Kirkham , to Libya 's defense ministry dated January 25 was found this week in the Khamis Brigade 's bullet-scarred compound near Tripoli . \nThat date marked the start of anti-government protests in Egypt , to Libya 's east . \nLibya 's neighbor to the west , Tunisia , had already toppled its president and political analysts were predicting similar protests could erupt against Gaddafi . \nThe note , and an Arabic document accompanying it , listed 40 T-72 tanks , eight Palmaria artillery pieces , four BTR-60 armored personnel carriers , 10 Shilka anti-aircraft systems and two M-113 armored personnel carriers to be upgraded . \n`` These platforms are required to meet the proposed 1 April conversion deadline , '' said the letter , which listed offices in England and Wales . \nA spokesman for General Dynamics , Rob Doolittle , said he could not comment specifically on the documents without seeing them , but said the equipment might have been included in the British subsidiary 's May 2008 contract with Libya . \nThat deal came as `` part of the United Kingdom 's initiatives to improve economic , educational and defense links with Libya , '' a statement released at the time said . \n`` It will provide communications and data handling capabilities , together with technical and training support , to the Elite Brigade of Libya 's armed forces , '' the release said . \nDoolittle said the firm did not finish deploying the system , involving a process sometimes referred to as `` conversion '' -- switching from one communications system to another -- and did not train Libyan forces in its use . \nA small group of General Dynamics UK employees working on the system were withdrawn from Libya in early February , he added . \nInside the Khamis Brigade compound , a narrow road cuts through rows of planted cypress trees which shield the central area from view . \nThe burned-out husks of tanks and ammunition crates lay tucked between the trees . \nHuman rights activists and analysts say the Khamis unit played a major role in the civil war , spearheading the fight against NATO-backed rebels who took up arms after a crackdown on anti-government protesters in February . \nA leaked 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable said the brigade `` effectively serves as a regime protection unit . '' \nLibyans knew the brigade for its discipline and fierce loyalty to Gaddafi . \n`` This was a place of torture , a place of imprisonment , a place of mercenaries and a place of terrorism , '' Abdel Hafidth Iswad , a former rebel now helping guard the compound , said . \nThe General Dynamics UK deal to provide communications technology to the unit came the year after former Prime Minister Tony Blair 's 2007 visit to Libya , a seminal moment in the push to warmer relations between Gaddafi and the West . \nFor years , Gaddafi had been shunned for his government 's alleged role in bombings and other attacks in Britain and elsewhere , and was accused by human rights activists of brutal repression of dissent at home . \nThe documents obtained by Reuters showed the General Dynamics UK work was scheduled up to and through the date the revolt broke out , with start dates between February 10 and February 24 , and end dates between February 24 and March 17 . \nSeparate documents found by Human Rights Watch in the unit 's compound , overrun by anti-Gaddafi fighters last month and now open to journalists , showed the brigade was receiving arms from a variety of countries and companies . \nOne 2004 order marked the delivery of Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles , and one from 2009 showed an unspecified delivery was made from South Africa . \nAnother 2009 order showed rifles came from Belgium 's FN Herstal . \nBoxes of those FN rifles now litter the compound , including the archives room where many of the documents related to the daily functioning , tactical planning and weapons procurement of the base were found . \n`` Is anyone surprised these weapons were used against his -LRB- Gaddafi 's -RRB- own people ? '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIf it 's based in America it is American , so what if they have a section in the UK ? \nSo you see , the US government has no problem with American companies providing weapons and technology to unpopular undemocratic regimes . \nCorporations rule American policy . \nKind of interesting , but no big surprise , we are n't the most moral country . \nHey -- Our government tortures ! \nYou can not expect much from the good old USA anymore . \nWhy would they be embarrassed ? \nI 'm sure it was a very lucrative deal for them . \nKind of like Halliburton 's current drilling operations in Iran . \nOr Reagan 's arms deals to the Mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan -LRB- early Al Qaeda brigades -RRB- . \nYou ca n't embarrass these people . \nMaking more than one billion dollars means never having to say you 're sorry . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nBurkina President Blaise Compaore denied discussing giving Gaddafi sanctuary . \n`` We have no information regarding the presence of Libyans on our soil since these events , and we have had no contacts with anyone in Libya about a request for political asylum , '' he told reporters in the capital Ouagadougou . \nCompaore has ruled for 24 years after taking power , like Gaddafi , in a military coup . \nAnd like other African states , Burkina benefited from oil-funded Libyan aid under Gaddafi . \nNiger has also tried to distance itself . \nOfficials have confirmed that Gaddafi 's security chief Mansour Dhao had been let in but insisted it was a humanitarian gesture . \nIts interior minister denied on Tuesday a report from Niger and French military sources that 200-250 Libyan army vehicles had arrived via Algeria on Monday near the northern town of Agadez . \nAs with all efforts so far to find Gaddafi , two full weeks after his Tripoli headquarters were overrun by the motley collection of rebel groups who rose up in February , the trail is hazy , in a region where people are few and far between . \nBuhagiar also said : `` He 's out of Bani Walid , I think . '' \nHe was referring to the besieged tribal bastion , 150 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , where fighters of the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- have been trying to negotiate the surrender of a hard core of Gaddafi loyalists . \nNTC commanders said last week they thought Gaddafi , 69 , was there planning a counter-strike with Saif al-Islam , his heir apparent , and intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi . \nBut it appears the senior figures are not there now , officials say . \nAll three are wanted by the International Criminal Court at The Hague for war crimes committed during the revolt -- though Libyans say they want to try them first , including for atrocities over the four decades before this year 's uprising . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he was unsure whether , as U.S. officials have said , Gaddafi was still in Libya : `` I think he 's been taking a lot of steps to make sure that in the end he could try to get out if he had to , but as to where , when , and how that 'll take place , we just do n't know . '' \nGaddafi 's fugitive spokesman , Moussa Ibrahim , insisted in a call to Reuters on Tuesday that he had not left . \n`` He is in Libya . \nHe is safe , he is very healthy , in high morale . '' \nNTC commanders have said this week they believe Ibrahim may be in Bani Walid , where a tense standoff continued . \nOutside the town on Wednesday , residents leaving through a sun-scorched NTC checkpoint set up around the nearby settlement of Wishtata painted an increasingly desperate picture inside Bani Walid . \n`` People are terrorised . \nThere is no one in the streets , '' said Salah Ali , 39 . \n`` But many still support Gaddafi because they were paid by the regime , because many have committed crimes and are afraid of arrest . '' \nInside Bani Walid , tucked away in a valley in barren hills south of the capital , residents said Gaddafi-era green flags still wave above houses and a portrait of the `` Brother Leader '' in military uniform towers above its central square . \nShooting in the air and shouting insults from the back of their pick-up trucks , groups of Gaddafi loyalists regularly speed through its streets , residents said . \nThey often shout `` Allah , Muammar , Libya , nothing else ! '' \n-- the principal slogan of the old regime , especially during this year 's civil war . \n`` I went to see my family there yesterday , '' said Imad Mohammed Ali , a 21-year-old supporter of the new leadership . \n`` There is no electricity , no cooking gas , no communications . \nThere is n't enough food . \nPeople are using coal to make fire . \nThere is no medicine . \nThere are no people in the streets .

'' \n`` There will be a long , slow incremental process of building up to where they ought to be , and that could take much longer than people hope . \nIt could be three years if it 's tough . '' \nIndustry players are optimistic that the taps will be easy enough to turn back on in some oilfields . \nThe chief executive of Austrian energy group OMV told Reuters it would take 12-18 months for oil production in Libya to get back to pre-war levels . \nChristopher Bellew , broker at Jefferies Bache said many in the market believed Libyan oil could come back on track even more quickly than this . \n`` In general , oil tends to come on stream quicker than people expect because there 's such a strong economic incentive to see the oil flowing , '' Bellew said . \n`` But there are the unknowns on whether civil war will continue and whether there will be attacks on instillations . '' \nWhile production has started at various oilfields , and tenders for sales of some oil have been submitted , there has been little significant volume of crude exported since the National Transitional Council took power . \nThe way in which the first cargo was brought to market highlights the pitfalls for getting crude to world markets . \nLibya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- Agoco -RRB- filled a cargo which failed to attract buyers because of confusion over quality , traders said this week . \nTrading house Vitol re-offered the oil on Thursday . \nAnd a lack of experience leading to errors and slow progress in getting oilfields and refineries back up to scratch will likely be a theme that keeps a brake on progress as Libya struggles to attract back people with appropriate expertise . \n`` It will need tens of thousands of people to return , such as oil engineers from places like China and India , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy . \n`` Many will have left Libya in difficult circumstances , and may not want to go back . '' \nAnd while Libya post war -- at least so far -- looks to be in much better shape than Iraq , which was traumatised for years by sectarian violence , there are still plenty of obstacles in the way of a steady flow of oil . \nOil companies that had significant operations have said they are unwilling to send staff back to fields that they operated before the hostilities erupted because they still see the situation as too unsafe and volatile . \nFrench oil major Total said on Monday that it was not planning to transport any Libyan crude oil for now . \nAnd even when companies are confident their staff will be safe , poor quality infrastructure will slow progress . \n`` There was not that much damage -LRB- caused by the fighting -RRB- , but the equipment was in a bad state before the war after decades of under-investment and mismanagement , '' Ciszuk said . \n-LRB- Editing by Christopher Johnson -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIn Tripoli on Thursday , the U.S. ambassador returned to work after a hiatus caused by the civil war , and predicted a quick end to the fighting . \n`` I think it is a matter of time -LRB- for -RRB- Gaddafi and his remaining loyalists . \nTheir resistance is finished , '' Ambassador Gene Cretz told reporters at a ceremony to mark the re-opening of the U.S. mission . \nLibya 's interim government received a diplomatic boost when its neighbor Algeria recognized the NTC as the country 's legitimate representative , according to a report broadcast by Al Arabiya . \nAlgeria was the last of Libya 's neighbors to grant recognition , and the two sides have for months been trading allegations . \nThe NTC accused Algiers of abetting Gaddafi in the civil war , and Algeria said it was worried the new government was not firm enough on the threat from Islamist militants . \nWestern security officials say good relations between Libya and Algeria are vital if they are to keep a lid on al Qaeda 's north African branch , which has kidnapped foreigners and attacked Western targets in the region . \nThe country 's new rulers were faring less well on the battlefield , aside from advances in the far south . \nIn the two biggest towns where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out , Sirte and Bani Walid , the NTC 's offensive has been chaotic , raising fresh questions about the council 's ability to run the oil exporting country effectively . \nDespite support from NATO warplanes , government forces have struggled to capture Sirte , Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown and the biggest of the towns still outside their control . \nIt is a thorny task because the sympathies of many residents lie with Gaddafi . \nThe city typifies the challenges the NTC faces in reconciling the significant parts of the country that have tribal loyalties to Gaddafi or did not support the revolution . \nA spokesman for Gaddafi told Reuters on Thursday that NATO air strikes and interim government forces ' shelling of Sirte were killing civilians . \n`` Between yesterday and this morning , 151 civilians were killed inside their homes as the Grad rockets and other explosives fell upon their heads , '' Moussa Ibrahim said in a satellite phone call to Reuters from an undisclosed location . \nHis claims could not be verified as journalists are unable to reach the city . \nNATO comment was not immediately available . \nThere was a counter-claim from rebel fighters near Sirte , and from residents fleeting the city , who said that pro-Gaddafi forces had been executing people suspected of sympathising with the NTC forces . \nAn NTC commander on the outskirts of Sirte , who gave his name as Saleh , showed Reuters a handwritten list of families whose members were said to have been executed in Sirte . \n`` One man , they cut him like this , '' the commander said , dragging his finger from the ends of his mouth across his cheeks . \n`` Another , they cut his lips . '' \nOn the Western outskirts of Sirte on Thursday there was little fighting , and dozens of civilians poured out of the city through anti-Gaddafi checkpoints . \nOver on the eastern side of the city , NTC forces came under heavy artillery fire . \nOne fighter there said pro-Gaddafi artillery batteries appeared to have found the range of the NTC tanks , positioned more than 50 km east of Sirte , and were targeting them . \n`` There has been heavy shelling from Gaddafi forces , '' said Adel Al-Tarhouni , an anti-Gaddafi fighter in the village of Sultana , which came under artillery attack . \n`` I was able to see palm trees cut from the top by the shrapnel . '' \nNorth of Bani Walid , NTC military forces brought forward tanks and Grad rocket launchers in preparation for a renewed attempt to take the town . \nIt was not clear when that attack might begin . \nLater in the day , a Reuters reporter near the town said fighting had resumed after a lull , though it did not appear to be an all-out assault . \nGaddafi loyalists were firing shells at NTC positions on the edge of the town , and plumes of smoke could be seen rising up from within Bani Walid . \nThe offensive there has been frustrated by stiff resistance from well-drilled loyalist fighters , and also by a lack of organization among the NTC forces . \nThey operate in disparate units based on their home towns , with little overall command . \nOn Wednesday , one fighter shot his own head off and killed another fighter while handling a rocket-propelled grenade in full view of a Reuters team . \nIn another incident , a fighter wounded himself and another fighter after losing control of his machinegun . \nThe nascent NTC national army has tried to bring order . \nIf the NTC is unable to swiftly assert its control over the country and its own forces , it could embarrass Western leaders , especially France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain 's David Cameron , who took a gamble by backing the anti-Gaddafi leadership . \n`` We have set up a unified operations room to unite all brigades , '' said brigade commander Omar Kabout . \n`` The purpose is to increase coordination and end all this chaos because many rebels have arrived without commanders . \nWe need to put them into brigades and stop all this random shooting . '' \nBut the message was not getting through to all the fighters , many of whom go into battle wearing flip-flop sandals , T-shirts and jeans and have no military training . \n`` We do n't take orders from the NTC . \nWe listen only to our own commander , '' said Ziyad Al Khemri , a fighter from the town of Zawiyah , just west of Tripoli . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tarek Amara in Tunis , Emma Farge in Tripoli , Maria Golovnian north of Bani Walid , Sherine El Madany east of Sirte , Alexander Dziadosz west of Sirte and Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers and Dina Zayed in Cairo ; Writing by Christian Lowe ; Editing by Roger Atwood -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nHani Soufrakis , a Libyan businessman living in Cairo , noted that Egyptian authorities allowed Libya 's opposition to operate in Egypt during the uprising , which was a big help to the rebels . \nBut Gaddafi-linked businesses in Egypt , such as hotels and real estate projects , were also permitted to continue working with impunity , he added . \n`` They allowed Gaddafi to keep doing essentially what he wanted and his investments here in Egypt were largely untouched , '' Soufrakis said . \n`` It 's still Gaddafi 's men running them . '' \nAnalysts believe the new Egyptian government was distracted from Libya by other policy challenges after the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak earlier in the year , or it may have wanted to avoid committing itself to the uncertain result of a conflict on its doorstep . \nEither way , said Ezzedin Choukri-Fishere , international relations professor at the American University in Cairo : `` Egypt kind of pretended nothing was happening in Libya . '' \nTrying to make up for lost time in building relations with Libya 's new government , Egypt said it was sending a high-level foreign ministry delegation to Libya days after Gaddafi fled into hiding in late August . \nEgyptian firms are already lining up . \nAmong them is El Sewedy Electric , which has exported its cables to Libya since 1999 and agreed in 2003 to set up a $ 64 million factory in Tripoli , although the project has yet to be developed . \nChief Executive Ahmed el-Sewedy told Reuters that Egypt 's government was supporting Egyptian firms , but he said they would find competition in Libya tough and could face a challenge getting into a market that many have not ventured into for years , if at all . \n`` We thought Egyptian companies would have a lot of work with Libya . \nBut I 'm not sure . \nAll the world is now focusing on Libya and most Egyptian companies have not been there in the last 10 years ... For the new companies to go ahead it will be possible , but not easy . '' \nHe added that orders for his company from Libya , which had been put on hold during the civil war , would now go ahead . \n`` For our manufacturing project there , we have to discuss with the new government to see what they want to do . '' \nOther Egyptian companies cited by analysts as possible contenders for business are Orascom Telecom and Orascom Construction . \nBoth have a reputation for drumming up business in the toughest of emerging markets . \nLibya took slightly over 4 percent of Egypt 's exports of about $ 25 billion last year , before the civil war , Egyptian media quoted trade ministry officials in Cairo as saying . \nOfficials on both sides say there is scope for trade to rise . \nAlthough the war has ravaged Libya 's economy , reconstruction demand -- for building materials , vehicles , machinery and other products -- is expected to be substantial . \nIt could emerge quickly ; foreign lenders such as the International Monetary Fund are offering to provide short-term financing to Libya , and in the medium term it can expect to begin using an estimated $ 150 billion of sovereign assets that were once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle , and are now frozen abroad . \nBefore the war , petrodollars lured hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Egypt , a country of 80 million people , to find jobs in Libya on farms and in factories and to work as carpenters , plumbers and mechanics . \nMany fled during the fighting , but others stayed and more are likely to return as Libya rebuilds . \nHouni said Egypt had since March provided Libya with electricity to replace capacity destroyed by Gaddafi 's forces in the conflict , and that further cooperation in the area of power was being discussed . \nEgypt , which has government institutions that survived the uprising to overthrow Mubarak in February , might also offer expertise to a fellow Arab state seeking to rebuild institutions that are in disarray after Gaddafi 's ouster . \nLibyan officials say Egypt could provide teachers , doctors and consultants to help revamp education , the police force , utilities and infrastructure . \nEgyptian investment bank Beltone Financial , which set up an office in Libya before Gaddafi was overthrown , said the change of government would create business opportunities for it , because foreign investors would become more interested in the Libyan economy . \n`` We expect from our own perspective that there will be plenty of mergers and acquisitions by European and Gulf entities in the Libyan market , '' said Khalid Helal , managing director at Beltone Securities International . \nForeigners were already interested before the rebellion in telecommunications , steel , cement and other assets in Libya . \nBeltone had been helping to manage planned initial public offers of shares by Libyan mobile phone firms Madar and Libyana , Helal said . \nBut he added that Egyptian firms could not afford to wait to pursue such opportunities : `` We in Egypt should start yesterday , because we will be in severe competition with Asians and Gulf states .

'' \nThe National Oil Corp would become free of sanctions , which should enable the oil-producing OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily once the resolution is approved . \nBut some of the sanctions on other firms would remain in place . \nAssets of the central bank , the Libyan Foreign Bank , Libyan Investment Authority , and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio that have been frozen abroad by U.N. member states are to remain frozen for the time being , unless they have been exempted from the freeze by the council 's sanctions committee . \nSuch assets , the draft says , can only be released on the basis of a decision of the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee , which one senior Security Council diplomat said has already unfrozen $ 16 billion of Libyan assets to date . \nThe council diplomat described the easing as a `` progressive or controlled lifting of the asset freeze . '' \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , he added that Britain , the drafter of the resolution , hoped to put it to a vote by Friday . \nARMS EMBARGO , NO-FLY ZONE REMAIN IN PLACE Libya 's frozen assets have been held by various governments over the last half year in compliance with the U.N. sanctions regime imposed in February and March . \nThe draft resolution does not call for an end to the no-fly zone over the North African state or an end to NATO 's authorization to protect civilians . \nBut it does call for an easing of the arms embargo to enable Libyan authorities and U.N. security officials to import weapons needed to maintain security . \nThe draft resolution also follows recommendations from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who asked the council to establish a U.N. mission to help advise Libya 's transitional leadership on restoring public order and security and preparing for democratic elections . \nThe initial order for a mission would be valid for three months . \nThe mission would not include peacekeepers or U.N. police to help maintain order in the country . \nBut the mission , which diplomats say would have up to 200 staff , would help the government promote human rights , the draft says . \nLittle resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya . \nRussia and China , which worked hard to prevent the Security Council from waiving certain sanctions to aid the rebel forces during the Libyan civil war , are expected to support the resolution , diplomats say . \nMoscow and Beijing were highly critical of the U.N.-approved NATO intervention in Libya but both have recently recognized Libya 's National Transitional Council as the country 's legitimate government . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nA doctor in the western city said at least seven people were killed during fighting between rebels and government forces earlier in the day . \nMost of the dead were believed to be rebels . \nBritish aircraft and navy ships attacked a training base for bodyguards for Gaddafi 's inner circle and intelligence buildings in the capital , the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday . \nIn central Tripoli , NATO airstrikes hit two buildings including one a Libyan spokesman said contained files detailing corruption cases against government officials who have defected . \nOfficials summoned reporters after the attack in the early hours to visit the two damaged buildings , which they said housed security forces and Libya 's anti-corruption agency . \nOne building was in flames . \nThousands have been killed in the Libyan conflict , the bloodiest revolt of what has been called the `` Arab Spring '' of protests that has removed autocratic leaders in Tunis and Cairo . \nLibyan rebels briefly pulled back from the Dehiba-Wazin border post on the frontier with southern Tunisia on Tuesday . \nFive were killed and several wounded by Libyan government shellfire , they said . \nAt least four Russian-made Grad rockets fired from Libya landed inside Tunisia during the clashes . \nThe crossing is on a supply route for rebels in Libya 's Western Mountains and is an exit point for injured fighters . \nTunisia said it would refer Tripoli to the U.N.

'' \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow `` asked our French colleagues today whether reports that weapons from France were delivered to Libyan rebels correspond with reality . '' \n`` If this is confirmed , it is a very crude violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970 , '' he said . \nThat resolution , adopted in February , imposed a comprehensive arms embargo . \nParis said on Wednesday it believed it had not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which it says is allowed under a later Security Council resolution . \n`` We believe that U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , read together , neither specified nor precluded providing defense materiel to the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . \nNevertheless , although legal , arming the rebels was `` not an option that we have acted on , '' he said . \nAlthough Russia is not involved in the bombing campaign , its stance could add to reservations among some NATO countries wary over an air war that has lasted longer and cost more than expected . \nMoscow could also challenge Paris at the U.N. Security Council , where both are veto-wielding permanent members . \nU.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the Security Council to determine what is permitted by its resolutions . \nFrance 's weapons airlift , while possibly increasing the insurgent threat to Gaddafi , highlights a dilemma for NATO . \nMore than 90 days into its bombing campaign , Gaddafi is still in power and no breakthrough is in sight , making some NATO members feel they should help the rebels more actively , something the poorly-armed insurgents have encouraged . \nBut if they do that , they risk fracturing the international coalition over how far to go . \nThe World Bank 's Libya representative said on Thursday Islamist militants could gain ground if the conflict wears on . \n`` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . \n`` In three months we could be dealing with extremists . \nThat 's why time is very important in this conflict , before we face problems in managing it . '' \nEven before news of the French arms supply emerged , fissures were emerging in the coalition with some members voicing frustration about the high cost , civilian casualties , and the elusiveness of a military victory . \nGaddafi says the NATO campaign is an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing the North African state 's oil . \nHe says NATO 's U.N.-mandated justification for its campaign -- to protect Libyan civilians from attack -- is spurious . \nNATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen made clear on Thursday the weapons airlift was a unilateral French initiative . \nAsked by reporters on a visit to Vienna if NATO had been involved , he answered : `` No. '' `` As regards compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolution , it is for the U.N. sanctions committee to determine that , '' Rasmussen said . \nThe rebel advance toward Tripoli 's southwest outskirts from the Western Mountains has not been matched by progress toward the capital from the east , where they hold Misrata on the coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the capital . \nThe city has been bombarded for months by Gaddafi 's forces . \nSix rockets landed early on Thursday near the oil refinery and port . \nA Reuters journalist there reported no casualties . \nBritain 's military said its Apache helicopters had attacked a government checkpoint and two military vehicles near Khoms , on the Mediterranean coast between Misrata and Tripoli . \nInsurgents say Gaddafi 's forces are massing and bringing weapons to quell an uprising in Zlitan , the next big town along the road from Misrata to the capital . \nRebels inside Zlitan said they mounted a raid on pro-Gaddafi positions on Wednesday night . '' \n-LRB- We -RRB- carried out a violent attack last night on checkpoints ... and exchanged gunfire , killing a number of soldiers , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from the town . \nLe Figaro newspaper said France had parachuted rocket launchers , assault rifles and anti-tank missiles into the Western Mountains in early June . \nA French military spokesman later confirmed arms had been delivered , although he said anti-tank missiles were not among them . \nDespite the diplomatic storm , the rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . \n`` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . \nThe conflict has halted oil exports from Libya , helping push up world oil prices . \nJibril said it may take years for oil exports to fully resume : `` No , no oil is being sold . \nA lot of the oil well system was destroyed , especially in the east .

'' \nThe National Oil Corp would become free of sanctions , which should enable the oil-producing OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily once the resolution is approved . \nBut some of the sanctions on other firms would remain in place . \nAssets of the central bank , the Libyan Foreign Bank , Libyan Investment Authority , and the Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio that have been frozen abroad by U.N. member states are to remain frozen for the time being , unless they have been exempted from the freeze by the council 's sanctions committee . \nSuch assets , the draft says , can only be released on the basis of a decision of the Security Council 's Libya sanctions committee , which one senior Security Council diplomat said had already unfrozen $ 16 billion of Libyan assets to date . \nThe council diplomat described the easing as a `` progressive or controlled lifting of the asset freeze . '' \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , he added that Britain , which drafted the resolution , hoped to put it to a vote by Friday . \nARMS EMBARGO , NO-FLY ZONE REMAIN IN PLACE Libya 's frozen assets have been held by various governments over the past half year in compliance with the U.N. sanctions regime imposed in February and March . \nThe draft resolution does not call for an end to the no-fly zone over the North African state or an end to NATO 's authorization to protect civilians . \nBut it does call for an easing of the arms embargo to enable Libyan authorities and U.N. security officials to import weapons needed to maintain security . \nThe draft resolution also follows recommendations from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who asked the council to establish a U.N. mission to help advise Libya 's transitional leadership on restoring public order and security and preparing for democratic elections . \nThe initial order for a mission would be valid for three months . \nThe mission would not include peacekeepers or U.N. police to help maintain order in the country . \nBut the mission , which diplomats say would have up to 200 staff , would help the government promote human rights , the draft says . \nLittle resistance to the resolution is expected in the council , diplomats say , since nearly all members have concluded that Gaddafi is effectively no longer in control of Libya . \nRussia and China , which worked hard to prevent the Security Council from waiving certain sanctions to aid the rebel forces during the Libyan civil war , are expected to support the resolution , diplomats say . \nMoscow and Beijing were highly critical of the U.N.-approved NATO intervention in Libya but both have recently recognized Libya 's National Transitional Council as the country 's legitimate government . \nA nine-person U.N. General Assembly credentials committee decided on Wednesday to recommend that diplomats representing Libya 's National Transitional Council be accredited to the world body , a U.N. diplomat said . \nLibya 's U.N. ambassador , Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , and his deputy , who formerly represented Gaddafi but declared allegiance to the rebels in February , had been de-accredited by the United Nations at the request of the Gaddafi government . \nDiplomats said the General Assembly was likely to accept the committee 's recommendation on Friday . \nThat is normally done by consensus , but several left-wing Latin American countries that had close ties with Gaddafi could force a vote , which they would likely lose , diplomats said . \nA U.N. official said Shalgham was expected to be reinstated in his post . \n"}

'' \nAnalysts and traders say the trend is likely to diminish as the supply of Brent-related crude becomes more comfortable due to a restart of shipments in Libya and to hopes North Sea output will recover after months of underperformance . \nLibya , whose production was virtually halted by the civil war , is already restarting supplies . \nLibya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company said on Tuesday that production from the eastern oilfield of Sarir had reached 160,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- . \nChristophe Barret , an analyst at Credit Agricole , cited the weaker prices of Brent for delivery in later months as evidence that the strength of the spread will not persist . \n`` Later on , we will have much more relaxed balances , and that 's why you have prices that are coming down further down the curve , '' he said . \n`` I think there is real pressure on the market because of the loss of Libyan supply , '' he said of the spread at present . \nPrevious spikes in the spread this year have peaked on contract expiries , such as on July 14 , June 15 and May 16 . \nSupply of Forties , the crude that usually sets the price of dated Brent , began to underperform noticeably in May because of problems at Nexen 's -LRB- NXY . \nTO -RRB- Buzzard field , which delayed shipments and supported prices . \nDelays have persisted into September , and in October less Forties is scheduled to load than in September . \nForties ' premium to dated Brent hit $ 1.80 a barrel last week , the highest in more than three years . \nOlivier Jakob , analyst at Petromatrix , said there were a number of reasons for volatility in the Brent spread before expiries , including the fact it is a financially settled contract , developments in fundamentals and the reinforcing effect of trading . \n`` The physical premiums have been very strong , so it does justify a backwardation in Brent . \nNow should that backwardation be a dollar , two dollars , that is always a bit difficult to fully assess , '' he said . \n`` What the traders do can also be part of it . \nIt 's a bit of a micro-market , so when you have some small imbalances , it will be traders ' job to trade around it . '' \nMontefusco of Sucden said the strength of the prompt spread could be difficult to repeat in coming months as supplies increase . \n`` It 's very well bid now , but hopefully going forward we 'll have a bit more oil around , '' he said . \n`` I think they are trying to get it out of the way now before we start getting this other oil coming back .

There is no government control in the northern parts -LRB- of the Sahel fringing Libya -RRB- , '' Aning told Reuters . \nAQIM emerged out of the Algerian Salafist movement in 2007 and , under pressure from the Algerian army to the north , has become increasingly active in the Sahara region . \nThe group , believed to number no more than a few hundred , has taken advantage of poor cross-border coordination to mount sporadic attacks on local armies and kidnap Westerners , earning some $ 50-70 million in ransoms so far , analysts say . \nA recent flurry of regional diplomacy has underscored pressing concerns over a spillover from Libya . \nFears of a reprisal after the killing of Osama bin Laden are also high . \nThe leaders of Mali and Chad believe looted weapons have reached AQIM bases in northern Mali , with Chad 's president warning they could become the best-equipped force in the region . \nAn Algerian official spoke of several convoys . \nOthers say there is no proof yet , though few think it would take much for AQIM , which is plugged into weapons smuggling networks and flush in cash from ransoms , to obtain them . \n`` There are enough floating around that it would be extremely easy for people keen to get hold of them to do so , '' said Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director at Human Rights Watch , who has spent weeks documenting the looted arsenals in Libya . \nMuch of the focus has been on missing SA-7 shoulder-launched missiles , used by al Qaeda operatives who tried , but failed , to shoot down an Israeli charter plane in Kenya in 2002 . \n`` It is a top concern because this is one of the favorite weapons of al Qaeda groups , '' Bouckaert said , noting that militants in Iraq showed how stolen weapons could also be turned into bombs . \nOfficials are acutely aware of the threat and fears of a `` spectacular '' attack in retaliation for the killing of bin Laden are real , but due to their short range , SA-7s would have to be moved by militants from remote desert bases to near airports by major cities if airliners were to be targeted , experts say . \n`` They are probably more useful as defensive weapons , '' said one diplomat who monitors the group 's activities . \nAfter mostly opportunistic kidnappings , attacks this year in Niamey and Nouakchott have proven AQIM 's ambition to hit capital cities . \nBut another hurdle is the weapon itself , according to Nick Pratt , a terrorism expert at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies . \n`` It is not a weapon you just pick up and shoot ... The big issue is that it takes a long time to train , '' said Pratt , whose military experience included taking part in covert U.S. efforts to arm Mujahideen guerrillas in Afghanistan . \n`` Old Soviet-era -LRB- missiles -RRB- in the Sahara are less of a security concern than a truckload of AK 's -LRB- assault rifles -RRB- . '' \nIt may not just be the weapons that flow south either . \nThere are widespread reports of Gaddafi recruiting fighters , especially Tuareg nomads , to swell his ranks . \nSome of these new recruits , as well as fighters from the region who had long been in his ranks , will return home one day , officials say . \nSimilar flows of experienced fighters back into marginalized parts of Mali and Niger were factors in rebellions during the 1990s . \nThese countries ' governments are still struggling to heal wounds after the most recent uprisings between 2007 and 2009 . \n`` There is something of a historical pattern we do n't want to repeat , '' said Andre LeSage , Africa expert at the U.S-based National Defense University . \nNorthern Mali , with its grinding poverty and isolation , is particularly susceptible . \nAQIM has turned it into a rear base , integrating into local tribes through marriage and seeking to drive a wedge between the government and local populations . \nProfitable smuggling networks also zigzag through the barren zone , undermining law and order and fuelling corruption . \nMali President Amadou Toumani Toure last week sought out support among community leaders , warning them of the risks of the flow of weapons and fear of AQIM recruiting new fighters . \n`` We need community leaders to be on good terms with national governments so there is n't popular support for any movement ... so they do n't gain traction , '' LeSage said . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nArms infiltration has been a problem in North Africa for years coz border control there is very laxing or almost none . \nSome day , this problem may spread into Middle East . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIt has a population of just 1.7 million people , but the wealthy Gulf monarchy has long sought a major voice in political affairs in the region . \nIt has brokered peace talks in Sudan and Lebanon , owns the influential pan-Arab news network Al Jazeera , and recently won the right to host the 2022 soccer World Cup . \nNow the gas-rich nation has placed a big geopolitical bet in Libya , splashing out hundreds of millions of dollars on fuel , food and cash transfers for the rebels . \nA representative from the Emir 's palace declined to comment on what products Qatar has delivered to Libya , and on the ruling family 's motivations behind its Libyan engagement . \nIt 's certainly a gamble . \nIf the rebels win , Qatar is likely to pick up energy deals and new influence in North Africa . \nBut if they lose , Qatar 's ambitions may further alienate it among its neighbors . \n`` I guess ever since the late 1990s , Qatar has been trying to break the Saudi-dominated status quo and carve out a niche position , '' said Saket Vemprala from the London-based Business Monitor International consultancy . \n`` At the moment I think it 's more geopolitical , they want to broaden their -LRB- influence in the -RRB- region and become a more significant player ... And it certainly makes it easy for them to portray themselves as being on the right side of history , '' he said . \nThat sentiment is on display on a huge billboard in front of the courthouse . \nOver a picture of Qatari ruler Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani reads the promise : `` Qatar , history will always remember your support for our cause . '' \nBeing on the right side of history does n't come cheap . \nQatar was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police the U.N.-backed no-fly zone over Libya . \nSimultaneously , hundreds of millions of dollars began to flow from the Qatari capital Doha to Benghazi from early March . \nWhile international oil traders pondered whether to brave the bombs and international sanctions to start buying oil from the rebels , Qatar was quick to throw a lifeline and help eastern Libya meet its most pressing needs including fuel , food , medicines and telecommunications equipment . \nQatar 's foreign ministry has confirmed that it has shipped four tankers full of gasoline , diesel and other refined fuels to Benghazi , which specialists estimate is enough to feed the large Benghazi power plant for one or two weeks . \nBut people on the ground in Benghazi say they believe Qatar is behind much of the continuing delivery of fuel supplies , as well as food , medicine and cash payments . \nGiven that oil production in the east has stalled and the economy generates no cash , they ask , where else are all the supplies coming from ? \nOverall , the Qatari shipments have covered 100 percent of eastern Libya energy needs for a month and a half , Salah Fouad , a rebel oil engineer based in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk , said in May . \n`` We are receiving a huge help from Qatar . \nIts role in unforgettable . \nEven the little child knows Qatar 's role and assistance to us , '' he said . \nA western consultant who worked in Benghazi in March and April supported this view . \n`` You ask port workers how are they doing today and they say , ` Oh , we are fine . \nWe just received aid from Qatar , ' '' he said , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of his mission . \n`` You ask the council what 's the situation with diesel and they say , ` Oh we are just fine , we 've got new deliveries from Qatar . ' \nYou tell Libyan officials to let you know if something goes wrong with power facilities and they tell you , ` Oh we are just fine , Qatar is helping us . ' '' \nA Gulf-based oil trader with knowledge of Qatari gasoline deliveries estimated monthly requirements at 10 gasoline and 5-6 diesel cargoes a month to help run vehicles and Benghazi 's huge power plant . \nAs shipments are being settled on a government-to-government basis , they are usually not followed by satellite tracking systems , which monitor mostly commercial shipments . \nThose commercial shipments have included a test-case export cargo from the rebel-held east , shipped out in early May by trading house Vitol . \nSome traders say Qatar has gone further . \n`` Everyone gets excited about one Vitol cargo and does n't see a fleet of Qatari tankers , '' said another London-based trader . \nOther countries are helping the rebels as well , of course . \nAn anti-Gaddafi coalition called the Libya contact group , including the United States , France , Britain and Italy -- as well as Kuwait and Jordan -- agreed in May to set up a fund to help them ; Washington pledged to unlock some of the $ 30 billion -LRB- 18.3 billion pounds -RRB- of Libyan state funds frozen in the United States . \nWhat makes Qatar different is the breadth and depth of its aid . \nRebel officials in Doha say Qatari banks are helping facilitate international money transfers in rebel-held areas to recapitalise the paralysed banking system , though they wo n't say which banks . \nQatar is also believed by diplomatic sources in Doha to have granted some Libyans working for Qatari companies leave of absence so they can contribute to the war effort . \nSeveral western and Doha-based diplomatic sources say Qatar is even supplying the rebels arms , including possibly Milan anti-tank missiles . \nThe Gulf state declined to comment on whether it has supplied the rebels with arms , or in what quantity . \nIn May , the rebels estimated they urgently needed $ 2-3 billion in cash . \nWhen the anti-Gaddafi coalition set up its fund , Qatar immediately pledged the largest sum of $ 400 - $ 500 million . \nWhat 's behind Qatar 's generosity ? \nIt helps that it is so rich . \nQatar 's copious gas reserves have made it one of the world 's wealthiest countries , with a sky-high gross domestic product per person of $ 88,000 according to the International Monetary Fund . \nIts $ 60-billion plus sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in banks Credit Suisse and Barclays , as well as London 's iconic department store Harrods . \n`` Qatar will soon -- literally -- have more money than it knows what to do with , '' according to a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable , obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by Reuters . \nThe largesse in Libya is part investment , part strategic . \n`` They are looking to park investments around the world . \nThey helped the Lebanon peace process , Yemen , they got the World Cup , Doha talks , Al Jazeera -- these are all parts of a very big diplomatic game and a fight for influence , '' says a London-based British diplomat . \nThe big prize is energy . \nLibya produced 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the war , or almost 2 percent of world output , and has enough reserves to sustain that level of production for 77 years , according to BP . \nQatar would like to control a chunk of that oil supply as well as potentially large Libyan gas exports to Europe which otherwise would effectively rival Qatar 's own deliveries . \nAlthough gas markets have faced a severe glut in the past few years , the outlook is improving fast , especially in the aftermath of Japan 's Fukushima disaster and the decision by Germany to phase out nuclear power . \n`` Qatar is putting energy at the forefront of its diplomacy . \nLibya brings them closer to Europe and to their future markets . \nThey will be right on the Mediterranean , '' said the British diplomat . \nWith direct access to Europe , Qatar would be in a position to carve up the gas markets between itself and Russia , with which Doha enjoys increasingly friendly ties . \nThere 's also Libya 's sovereign wealth fund -LRB- LIA -RRB- , which has some $ 70 billion worth of assets frozen around the world . \nThe LIA owns stakes in Italian bank UniCredit , defense company Finmeccanica , British publisher Pearson which owns the Financial Times , and Belgian financial group Fortis , now known as Ageas . \nIf the rebels win , Qatar would have a say in what the LIA does with its investments . \n`` Libya is not Iraq . \nYou are unlikely to have a protracted civil war once it is over , '' said the western risk consultant who worked in Benghazi . \n`` So those investments are not like putting money at the bottom of a pit . \nIt should pay back and also possibly give Qatar influence on what the LIA can invest money in . \nIf we use takeover terminology , Qatar is exploring unrealised value . '' \nThe Qataris see such rich pickings they have recently turned down opportunities elsewhere , according to a source close to the Qatar Investment Authority -LRB- QIA -RRB- , the country 's sovereign wealth fund . \n`` Qatar 's leaders are intensely focussed on sorting out the crisis in Libya , to the extent that they have passed on a few items over the past few months . '' \nA popular joke in Benghazi illustrates Qatari ambitions in Libya perfectly . \nWhat 's the new nickname of Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani ? \nThe Emir of Qatar and Libya . \nSo why is an absolute monarchy , with little time for democracy at home , mixed up with a democratic rebellion ? \nQatar 's foreign ministry has cited the U.N. resolution and the emir 's desire to alleviate the suffering of the Libyan people . \n`` The reasons as laid out as to why Qatar is acting do not quite seem to account for the huge risks and extraordinarily bold actions that Qatar is taking , '' said David Roberts , deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute based in Doha . \n`` I can only account for this apparent discrepancy by suggesting that this policy is being heavily pushed by Qatar 's elite . '' \nRumours abound in Doha that the real reason for Qatar 's interest in Libya is that al-Thani 's wife Sheikha Mozah has close personal ties there , although her representatives declined to comment . \n`` Most of Qatar 's leadership , the al-Thanis and the sheikhs , know Libya very well , because they went to school with Libyans in the U.S. and the UK in the 70s and 80s , '' said Mahmoud Shammam , Doha-based spokesman for the rebels . \n`` So they know the situation there very well . \nThey know the ugliness of the regime .

about 50 were wounded on Thursday and Friday and one civilian in the all-but-deserted town was killed when a rocket fired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces hit a house . \nThe rebels have taken the residential zone of New Brega . \nBut that is 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the terminal and port area . \nThey hope that capturing the port 750 km east of the capital Tripoli will be a

facilities , firing rockets at rebel positions . \nGaddafi is clinging to power despite a near five-month-old NATO air campaign , tightening economic sanctions , and a lengthening war with rebels trying to end his 41-year rule . \nThe rebels have seized large swathes of the North African state , but are deeply divided and lack experience , and Thursday 's gains in the east broke weeks of stalemate . \nIn the west , rebel forces driving north toward the town of Zawiyah , within striking distance of Gaddafi 's stronghold in the capital , have not moved up from Thursday 's positions . \nRebels said they had reached the village of Bir Shuaib , some 25 km from Zawiyah , which has unsuccessfully risen up against Gaddafi twice this year . \nReuters interviewed a captured intelligence officer who said Gaddafi had reinforced Zawiyah , which also has a coastal oil refinery , with about 1,000 conscripts . \nBut there were no heavy weapons there and no African mercenaries as rebels insist . \nBrigadier-General Al-Hadi al-Ujaili predicted the rebels would face a hard fight to capture the town . \nHe said Gaddafi still enjoys strong support in Tripoli and among Libya 's main tribes , which he said was crucial . \nThe western battle is one of three widely separated rebel fronts against Gaddafi forces . \nIn the east around the ports of Misrata and Brega , fighting had been bogged down in recent weeks while the western rebels have advanced . \nZawiyah lies less than 50 km west of Tripoli , on the main road to Tunisia , which has been a lifeline for Libya but has begun to crack down on rampant smuggling of gasoline . \nRebels in the Western Mountains can muster a few thousand men if their separate units join forces . \nIn Misrata , a port on the Mediterranean under rebel control for months and which lies about 580 km west of Brega , six rebel fighters were killed in fighting on Friday . \nThree rebels were killed west of the city where they are fighting to

patrolling fuel stations to curb the flow of smuggled gasoline into neighboring Libya . \nInternational sanctions and the effects of Libya 's civil war have disrupted normal supplies of fuel to parts

'' \nNTC fighters have deployed an arsenal of homemade weapons . \nOn Wednesday a bulldozer arrived at the front fitted with armor and resembling a small ship , with a pointed prow and port holes . \nOn its front was mounted a tank turret and the sides were made from concrete sandwiched between steel plate . \nA man wearing a black ship 's captain 's hat with gold braid sat atop the contraption as it manoeuvred into place , ploughing into a lamp-post in the process . \nGovernment fighters shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' -LRB- God is greatest -RRB- as it made its lumbering progress towards make-shift barricades of vehicles and shipping containers put up by Gaddafi loyalists . \nThe NTC 's failure to seize Sirte , nearly two months since the fall of Tripoli , has raised questions about its ability to exert its authority over the entire country and has postponed the launch of its promised democracy program . \nOn Monday , NTC forces captured the other main Gaddafi stronghold , the desert town of Bani Walid , where the ousted leader 's loyalists had put up resistance for two months . \nNTC forces were poised a few days ago to declare victory in Sirte , but on Tuesday they were forced to retreat in some places under intense fire . \nBut a day later , NTC fighters had taken back the lost ground and made further gains so that for the first time government forces attacking from the east and west could see each other 's positions through the Gaddafi-held enclave . \nFighters reported Gaddafi soldiers had been firing at them wearing civilian clothes so had stepped up security and were closely checking the identities of everyone at the front , including reporters . \nBut faced with a disciplined and determined force , many NTC fighters theorised the defenders may be guarding a high-value target , perhaps even Gaddafi himself . \n`` Why else would a sniper try to take on a tank ? '' \nasked Jafar Al Sharif who commands some eight tanks positioned in the streets of Sirte pounding the low-rise apartment blocks housing Gaddafi remaining loyalists . \nThe NTC offensive , by mostly amateur fighters , has been hampered by a lack of coordination . \nUnits which converged on Sirte from Benghazi in eastern Libya and Misrata to the west have lost men when they fired at each other by mistake . \nGaddafi , wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of ordering the killing of civilians , is in hiding , possibly deep in Libya 's Sahara desert . \nInspired by protests in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt that ended in the overthrow of long-standing autocratic leaders , Libyans rose up against Gaddafi in February , but it took six months of civil war to end his one-man rule . \nThe NTC lent its backing to another regional revolt on Wednesday , officially recognizing as Syria 's legitimate authority an umbrella opposition council struggling to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad . \nWhile Gaddafi himself is still at large , his wife , two sons and a daughter fled to neighbouring Algeria shortly after Tripoli was captured by the NTC in August . \nAlgeria 's foreign minister said his country let them in for `` humanitarian reasons . '' \nThe NTC at the time called it an `` act of aggression , '' but has since moved to patch up ties with Algeria . \n`` Algeria has systematically honored all its obligations as a member of the international community , '' Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told a news conference in Algiers alongside British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday . \nHague , on a tour of the region , said he respected Algeria 's position but had requested all countries in the region honor obligations to turn over any indicted war crimes suspects . \n"}

Security Council to unfreeze $ 1.5 billion in Libyan assets , a proposal South African has blocked for weeks because it objects to funding the rebel government . \nThe U.S. delegation submitted a draft resolution to the 15-nation body asking it to make the money available for civilian and humanitarian purposes `` as soon as possible . '' \nNo vote was held on the draft on Wednesday , but diplomats said a vote could come on Thursday or Friday . \nThe U.S. move to ask the Security Council to make a decision on a matter that would normally be handled by the council 's Libya sanctions committee came out of frustration with South Africa , which has refused to consent to the idea of handing over large sums directly to Libya 's rebel leaders . \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier that the Obama administration wanted to free up funds to provide humanitarian assistance and support to the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel government , which controls of most of Libya now thanks to recent gains by rebel fighters . \nThe U.S. draft resolution says the money , currently frozen by the U.S. government on the basis of U.N. sanctions adopted earlier this year , was not to be used for military purposes . \n`` None of the funds made available pursuant to this resolution will be provided for the purchase of arms , non-lethal military equipment or any other military-related activity , '' the draft text said . \nOf the $ 1.5 billion , $ 500 million would go to international humanitarian organizations directly , a proposal the South African delegation says it does not object to . \nDiplomats say the South Africans , however , have problems with the U.S. proposal to hand another $ 1.0 billion to `` third-party vendors supplying fuel and other urgently needed humanitarian goods '' and to what the resolution describes as an `` international mechanism '' for providing social services . \nThe South African objections , diplomats say , have prevented the sanctions committee from approving the U.S. request to release the funds , first submitted to the committee on August 8 . \nThe resolution says fuel from `` third-party vendors '' would not be used for military purposes and that the council would have `` written assurances '' to that effect from the rebel TNC . \nSeveral council diplomats told Reuters privately that they were uncomfortable with parts of the U.S. proposal . \nThey said South Africa was not alone in its reservations about handing funds over to the rebels , although it is the only country formally blocking the U.S. request on the sanctions committee . \nRussia and others have concerns about unfreezing funds for the TNC , they said . \nSouth African Ambassador Baso Sangqu told reporters his country was concerned that funding the TNC implied recognizing it , something the African Union had not so far done . \nPretoria was awaiting the outcome of an AU meeting on the issue on Thursday before deciding whether to lift its objections , he said . \nU.N. sanctions committees work on the basis of consensus , which means all 15 Security Council members -- including South Africa -- have a virtual veto . \nBy presenting a resolution to the council , the United States was preparing to bypass the sanctions committee and the need for consensus on its request . \nCouncil resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent council members -- the United States , China , France , Britain and Russia -- to pass . \nIf the objections to the U.S. request are lifted in the sanctions committee , there will be no need to vote on the resolution submitted by the U.S. delegation . \nIf the objections remain , Washington will demand a vote , envoys say . \nThe United States alone has frozen some $ 37 billion in Libyan assets , U.S. officials say . \nThe Security Council imposed sanctions in response to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's brutal crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this year . \nThe protests led to a civil war and U.N. approval for NATO intervention . \nThe request for the urgent unfreezing of $ 1.5 billion of sanctioned Libyan assets is separate from the longer-term discussions that will be taking place in Paris , Doha and New York about postwar planning for Libya , including the release of tens of billions of dollars of frozen Libyan funds . \n"}

'' \nGaddafi is believed to be hiding in the desert to the south . \nNTC forces have struggled to take Sirte and a few other bastions of Gaddafi loyalists , which has impeded efforts to set up effective government nationwide and restart oil production , the lifeblood of the Libyan economy . \nSeveral Libyan analysts also say they are worried fault lines are opening up between the Islamist-run Tripoli Military Council , which has nominal control over the capital and is also believed to be backed by Qatar , and groups loyal to interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril , a Western-trained technocrat . \nThe interim government sent out text messages on Monday urging their fighters to report to military bases and join the national army . \nConcern is rising in the capital about potential conflict among armed groups that converged on Tripoli in August and have stayed on to demand stakes in a future government . \nNTC forces in Sirte took three important landmark buildings on Sunday -- the main hospital , the university and the opulent Ouagadougou conference center , built to host the summits of foreign dignitaries that Gaddafi was fond of staging . \n`` Eighty percent of Sirte is now under our control , '' said Omar Abu Lifa , a commander of government forces attacking Sirte from the west . \nNTC forces have repeatedly claimed to be on the point of victory in Sirte , only to suffer sudden reversals at the hands of tenacious enemies fighting for their lives , surrounded on three sides and with their backs to the sea . \nIn just one field hospital to the east of the city , doctors said they had received 20 dead and 87 wounded over the last two days from fighting . \nThere were many more casualties elsewhere . \nOne man , a student , who had escaped from the center of the city , said he had watched from a rooftop on Sunday as Gaddafi soldiers destroyed 10 government pick-up trucks . \n`` Their morale is very high , '' said Salam Awad . \n`` They are prepared to fight to the death . '' \nNTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil said his men had reached Sirte city center , while the only other major town in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists , Bani Walid in the interior desert to the south , was also under siege from no fewer than five sides . \n`` I think and I hope , with the help of God , the liberation of these two towns will be completed by the end of this week . \nGod willing , '' he told a news conference in Tripoli on Sunday . \nSirte holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . \nHe built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt would serve you well if that was made more clear in your headlines . \nYou tend to do the same thing with the Syrian conflict . \nReuters should be above being the mouthpiece for the U.S. State Dept. . \nThe reports by the Mass Media , as someone rightly said , is largely based on reports from the NTC . \nWe hear reports like , the last bastions of Gadhafi Loyalists . \nSo many reports that made it to press have turned out to be false . \nOne would think , after being fed with outright lies , many times , in the past , the Media will employ due diligence before running to their blogs to post lies . \nI guess the Media , NATO and the NTC are fingers of the same hand . \nThey complement one another . \nFor those that do n't know , Jamahiriyas , the tribal Councils , and not the NTC , control 80 % of Libyan cities . \nThey were fast to hoist the banner of ` mission accomplished ' on taking Tripoli . \nThe Media , in their culpability , reported to readers as if the war in Libya had been won by the Rebels . \nTo-day , NATO is still bombing ferociously . \nI guess their mission is far from been accomplished . \nTo anonymot : Reuters is a fantastic news outlet . \nThey are not a `` mouthpiece '' for anyone . \nAnd to comment on Reuters when the FORMER regime has n't sputtered a word of truth in 42 years ! \nYou appear to be a troll but we can spot you a mile away . \nAnd it is n't necessarily anti-Gadaffi reporting , it 's anti-brutal mass murdering dictator . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "285", "time": "2011-08-23", "text": "WASHINGTON | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 11:33 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rich in oil but without a properly functioning state , a post-Gaddafi Libya faces major political and economic challenges as it tries to rebuild after four decades of despotic rule . \nA transitional council of Libyan rebels has already tried to roughly outline rebuilding plans , using a Power Point presentation for stabilizing a country while it is in the final throes of a violent transition . \nDiplomats who have seen the rough plan say the rebel Transitional National Council knows it must move swiftly to meet expectations of the masses of people who have provided the support and manpower to oust Muammar Gaddafi after 42 years . \nAmong the TNC 's biggest concerns is that the United States and others will be too slow in unfreezing billions of dollars of Gaddafi 's assets , leading to a complete breakdown of basic services , Western and Middle East diplomats told Reuters . \nOne option under consideration was for the transitional council to seek temporary bridge financing from the World Bank and other global institutions until political decisions are made to return all of its assets , the officials said . \nEven as fierce fighting persists in Tripoli , diplomats and financiers are accelerating plans to help Libyans rebuild once Gaddafi 's regime is ended . \nThe U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it was seeking to release between $ 1 billion -LRB- 605.7 million pounds -RRB- and $ 1.5 billion of frozen Libyan government assets to the rebels within days if it can secure the blessing of the United Nations sanctions committee . \nThe money would come from the roughly $ 32 billion in assets that the United States froze earlier this year , only about one-tenth of which , or $ 3 billion , is liquid . \nDiplomats said until the assets were unfrozen and all of the $ 32 billion is released , Libya would likely be under tight budget constraints , a risk for any new government seeking legitimacy . \nThe TNC has said it will meet officials from the United States , France , Italy , Britain , Turkey and Qatar in Doha on Wednesday to seek international funds to help Libya recover from the war . \nU.S. APPEARS TO WANT ONLY SUPPORTING ROLE The next phase of planning for post-conflict Libya would occur in Istanbul on Thursday , where senior diplomats from nations of the Libya Contact Group will gather , said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland . \nIt appears the United States wants to play , at best , a supporting role in post-war Libya , working through the United Nations and global financial institutions like the World Bank . \nLibya 's problems are unique because , after four decades of Gaddafi 's personalized rule , it does not have a regular state structure and therefore it is difficult for institutions like the World bank to know whether or not they are dealing with official representatives of Libya . \nIn addition , because of its oil wealth , Libya is considered a middle-income country and therefore is not eligible for some of the direct aid that poorer nations might qualify for through development institutions . \n`` It is going to be a challenge , '' said Marwan Muasher , a former foreign minister and deputy prime minister of Jordan , now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . \n`` There were no functioning institutions of the state to start with so you 're almost starting from scratch anyway , '' said Muasher , a former World Bank official QUICK COLLAPSE EVOKES IRAQ 'S 2003 DEFEAT The quick collapse of Gaddafi 's authority has inevitably evoked comparisons to the rapid U.S. military victory in Iraq in 2003 , which was followed by looting , chaos and civil war . \nBut a former senior U.S. diplomat with extensive experience in the Middle East said , `` Libya , on the face of it , ought to be a simpler case '' than Iraq . \nWhile acknowledging poor management of some state services , the former diplomat said the existence of a senior managerial class made Libya `` much more encouraging in that respect than the Baghdad of 2003 and those people need to feel like they have a stake , immediately , in the revival of their nation . '' \nMore than 30 countries have recognized the rebels ' TNC as the legitimate government of Libya , although it has not officially been acknowledged by international lenders like the International Monetary Fund . \nA Washington-based diplomat told Reuters that Libya would likely be discussed by the world 's leading economies of the Group of Eight at a September 9-10 meeting in France . \nIt could also be taken up by the Group of 20 leading economies on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings later next month . \nThe country 's assets in foreign currencies have reached about $ 168 billion and oil production could resume within the next 3 to 6 months , according to Libya 's former central bank governor . \nA sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also be pivotal for the country 's post-conflict transition , especially to rebuild broken infrastructure . \nThough somewhat depleted the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson and Unicredit . \nThere were attempts under Gaddafi to modernize the oil-based economy and government services by passing laws to attract new investment . \nBut much of the effort was wasted and pressure will be on the new transitional council to show Libya can be more than just an oil revenue-dependent country . \nEditing by Warren Strobel and Christopher Wilson -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nFrance 's Total is an active player in Libya . \nBritain 's BP has assets there but no production , as does Royal Dutch Shell . \nU.S. groups Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips are also active . \nGaddafi 's fall could give new players such as Qatar 's national oil company and trading house Vitol opportunities . \nQatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to give planes to police no-fly zones . \n`` There is obviously some benefit to the countries that helped the Libyans in the crisis , but that advantage can go quite quickly . \nSo British companies and French companies would want to get there as quickly as possible , '' Gavin De Salis , chairman of oil services firm OPS International , told Reuters Insider . \nEni , in Libya since the 1950s , produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2010 . \nIts oil production contracts are in force to 2042 and gas contracts to 2047 . \n`` Eni getting production restarted fast would win it good will with any new government in Libya , '' said Justin Jacobs , oil and gas analyst at Business Monitor International . \nEni has said that if stability returns , it would take one year to restart oil production and two to three months for gas . \nOn Tuesday the Libyan rebel envoy to Italy said he expected Italian contracts to be respected in a post-Gaddafi era . \nRussia and China opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi , and some say energy companies there could feel a backlash . \n`` We do n't have a problem with Western countries like Italians , French and UK companies . \nBut we may have some political issues with Russia , China and Brazil , '' said Abdeljalil Mayouf , information head at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO . \nRussian companies , including oil firms Gazprom Neft and Tatneft , had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya before the conflict started . \nChina , which took 3 percent of its imported crude from Libya last year , had about 75 companies operating there . \n`` The Chinese and Russians were reticent to step in and play an active pro-rebel role . \nCertainly European and U.S. companies stand to benefit from that , '' said Jacobs . \nBefore the war , Gazprom Neft agreed to buy a stake from Eni in Libya 's Elephant field , but that has been put on hold . \nEni is a strategic partner of Gazprom . \nGoing forward , much will depend on what a future rebel government will look like and where its sympathies lie . \n`` The big question is who the rebels are . \nI do n't think we 've seen the real leadership yet , which will probably be made up of new figures , '' said Karim Mezran , professor for Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Bologna . \n`` And another big issue is unfreezing Libyan assets . \nHow the European countries handle that one could give them leverage for their own oil companies .

'' \nNilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . \n`` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . \n`` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' \nNilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . \nHe said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . \nOil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . \nThose based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . \nPA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . \nOil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . \nMI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . \nAnalysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . \nSamuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . \n`` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said . \n`` In the south-west , where no fighting occurred and where the effects of looting and vandalism are thought to be low , production ... could start rising towards the pre-war 200,000 bpd level perhaps as soon as the pipeline to the coast is repaired and cleaned of potential residues .

{"id": "34", "time": "2011-08-23", "text": "LONDON | Tue Aug 23 , 2011 10:51 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The fortified Tripoli compound attacked by Libyan rebels Tuesday is the seat of Muammar Gaddafi 's political power and the principal base of loyalist fighters trying to rescue his 42-year-old rule . \nAnalysts say Gaddafi loyalist fighters confronted with an influx of rebels since the weekend have sought to use his Bab al-Azizyah bastion as a springboard from which to carve out a loyalist zone and chip away at rebel control of adjoining neighborhoods . \nThe encampment is believed to sit atop a network of tunnels and bunkers that lead to adjoining districts , including possibly a subterranean route to the coast . \nBut the tunnel networks are not the loyalist militiamen 's only card : Gaddafi 's fighters have an intimate knowledge of the city and many are believed to have a greater degree of military training than their opposition guerrilla opponents . \n`` This is Gaddafi 's Pentagon , '' said Noman Benotman , a senior analyst at the British think tank Quilliam and a former Libyan Islamist opposition guerrilla commander . \nHe said tunnels forking out from the complex to nearby districts gave his fighters precious access to supplies . \n`` Based in Bab al-Azizyah , Gaddafi 's force want to create chaos inside Tripoli and carve it up into rival militia zones , just like Beirut in the Lebanese civil war , '' said Benotman , who is also an associate of former Libyan spy chief Moussa Koussa `` By sending a message that ` there will be no peace without us ' his aim is to force his inclusion in talks on a political negotiation . '' \nLong the seat of Gaddafi 's power as well as his main Tripoli home , the barracks may well be the final battleground of Libya 's war . \nEven if Gaddafi is not there , its loss would inflict a potentially crippling symbolic defeat . \nIf Gaddafi is at the six sq-km -LRB- 2.3 sq mi -RRB- base , located south of Tripoli at the northern end of the Airport Highway , there is a fair chance he is in a tunnel under it rather than in a fortified room above ground . \nThe compound has often been targeted by NATO air strikes , but it is still defended by tanks and snipers , a fact that suggests Gaddafi or at least some key aides are nearby . \nAl Arabiya news channel said rebel forces had attacked the gates of the compound Tuesday as NATO warplanes flew low overhead . \nSky Television said smoke could be seen billowing from the compound following a NATO attack . \nCOMPOUND WALLS CAN BE BREACHED `` FROM THE AIR '' The site is normally dotted with tents , residential buildings , security encampments , and the cratered remains of a house bombed by U.S. warplanes in 1986 and kept in ruins as a memorial . \nA communications center , attacked months ago by NATO , sits on an adjoining plot . \nUmar al-Hariri , a military official of the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council , told Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper in June that the barracks were linked to underground tunnels up to 30 km -LRB- 20 miles -RRB- long , some of which led to the sea . \nHariri said that for rebel fighters attacking the compound it was just as important for NATO to breach the meter-thick , olive-green walls as to access the tunnels underneath . \n`` I met NATO at one time and told them that the most important thing they should strike are the walls of Bab al-Aziziyah because their thickness is one meter and they can not be penetrated by a tank or gun . \nThere must be a penetration from the air , '' he was quoted as saying . \nHe put the height of the walls at four meters . \nBuilt in the era of King Idris , overthrown by Gaddafi in the 1969 putsch that brought him to power , the site was reinforced in the 1980s using an array of foreign contractors . \nAnalysts say Western intelligence services will have long ago sought to question any foreign companies that helped build tunnels under the site , to learn how to attack the compound . \nFrom a rebel and Western perspective , that information is growing more valuable by the hour . \nJon Marks , chairman of Britain 's Cross Border Information risk consultancy and information service , said he suspected Western governments will have asked foreign companies that helped Gaddafi build his Great Man Made River project for any information about the tunnels under Tripoli , on the assumption some may have helped build them . \nThe Man Made River project sends water from wells in the Sahara desert to coastal communities along a 4,000 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- - long network of pipelines . \n`` The governments will be asking the companies for a debrief , '' he said , adding the Tripoli tunnels `` may have been done as a side order from the Man Made River work .

'' \nThe U.S. has supported many brutal tyrants : Saddam Hussein , Augusto Pinochet , Hosni Mubarak , Doc Chevalier , the Shah of Iran , Ferdinand Marcos , Suharto , and Somoza just to name a few . \nSupporting Gaddafi falls into the category of normal U.S. geopolitics . \nAmericans having been willing , decade after decade , to vote for leaders who have supported brutal dictators around the world . \nWhere then is the conflict with American values ? \nAmerican values seem to include supporting dictators around the world whenever various geopolitical goals are at stake . \n`` It is hard , looking at the bloodshed in Libya today , to reconcile the Bush administration s rapprochement with Gaddafi with American values . '' \nBush brought Gaddafi back into the international fold because Gaddafi renounced nuclear weapons . \nYou think that 's insignificant ? \nNATO is a big reason for the bloodshed in Libya today . \nTalk to the current president if you have a problem with that . \nAnd by the way , Gaddafi only dreamed of and talked about perpetrating the kind of violence against demonstrators that Syria 's Assad is actually doing . \nI do n't see America doing much about that , other than finger wagging . \nAlthough Republicans in the US often pain themselves as foreign policy experts , their actions and policies are often bizzare . \nIn the late 90 ? \nThe Bush administration officially praised the Taliban for helping to eradicate Afghanistan 's poppy crop about 6 months before the Sept 11 attacks . \nThe whole Iraq war\\/weapons of mass destruction thing speaks for itself . \nFor the Bush administration , driven by a family so steeped in big oil , their crazy decisions all seemed to revolve around gaining access to oil fields , either through force or diplomacy . \nI believe McCain even cast doubt on Pakistan 's previously democratically elected leaders and praised the military dictator running Pakistan at that time . \nAnd with all of the military escapades of the Bush administration , when Obama announced limited US engagement in Lybia , the Republicans cried foul . \nGeorge Bush Sr. ran a smooth and reasonable campaign to force Iraq out of Kuwait in the early 90 ? \ns.

much for standing up for the people . \nThe left is all about grabbing power in any shape or form . \nNothing for nothing , but I think you need to go back to your research and check on something ... `` acts that included the slaughter of American children in airports in Vienna and Rome . \nPresident Reagan quite rightly called Gaddafi the mad dog of the Middle East . \nWhile I think this is a little sensationalist to say that Americans were the primary targets in these attacks , these were attacks specifically against Israel and Israelis targeting El Al airlines ticket counters in Italy and Austria by Abu Nadil as retaliation against Israel for Operation Wooden Leg , where Israel bombed the PLO headquarters in Tunis -LRB- 10\\/85 -RRB- . \nThis had nothing to do with an attack on American children at all . \nI would suffice to say that if Americans were killed as additional damage , that Abu Nadil would n't have minded , however , that was not their main goal . \nAll too reminiscent of our early ties with Saddam Hussein . \nWe armed him to the teeth to be a counterweight to Iran and to guarantee the stability of Gulf oil . \nAnd then he began to feel invincible . \nWe all know how that ended . \nKeep an eye an Saudi Arabia . \nWe might see something similar happen there in the years to come . \nThanks for explaining so much . \nMs. Clinton continued the tradition of Gaddafi-coddling by a stubborn reluctance to support the rebels . \nObama was finally shamed into doing some air support for rebels when France and Britain took the leadership . \nThe Nato bombing started much too late . \nWhen Nato started air strikes , Gaddafi 's long exposed armored columns were now in the cities terrorizing citizens and the opportunity to wipe them out quickly was gone . \nWithout a doubt Oil is always an issue for the US in the ME . \nThe next issue is the welfare of Israel , still he only country actually eating another territory\\/country alive . \nBut the US has only itself to blame for its dependence on oil -- wherever the source . \nIt had spent the last 50 plus years building urban areas enslaved by the automakers . \nMost of the oil it uses is for transportation and home heating costs . \nit also uses more than any other country on a daily for auto use alone . \nthe last note got sent accidentally . \nThe problem is -- there is no fix for suburban sprawl . \nIt 's too diffuse and too expensive to service with adequate alternative transportation and many of the old rail lines are gone and their ROW 's are being eaten by encroachment by abutters or put to alternate uses like bicycle and hiking paths . \nThe sprawl itself usually kills off any local agriculture so the urban areas ca n't feed themselves at all without trucking everything from thousands of miles away . \nI look at Google earth to view urban areas world wide and very few of them -- even the gigantic areas like Sao Paolo , Or Beijing and even most European Cities look they are still being constructed around rail lines or other public transportation systems . \nLarge areas of Japan have become continuous city . \nBut they have 180 million people I recall . \nThe radiating valleys in the Kyoto area are continuous strips of farmsteads that all front on the common roads . \nIt must be easy to run regular bus lines along any of them to the nearest located rail lines . \nAs the country ages , it will become more difficult for seniors to have to live without public transportation . \nNursing home life is a miserable and very expensive way to die . \nAnd owning a car is becoming more expensive . \nThis country has made walking for daily errands or taking a bus or train impractical for any but inner city commuters residents . \nThe private automobile is one of the factors behind the trillions spent in foreign wars . \nThe biggest public transportation subsidies are being eaten by the automakers and it is the most inefficient way to move people . \nAnd all of the above to be held hostage by the cost of gas . \nVery stupid and not at all worth it . \nThere 's a mistake in the last paragraph . \nI meant to write `` that European cities look like they are being constructed around public transportation lines '' In other words : most of the world had more sense . \nAnd I want to add , that for decades European countries put a very high tax on gasoline . \nI do n't know for sure , but I think most countries except the ME , have taxed gasoline heavily . \nIf analysts totaled all the costs of extensive road and highway networks , purchase price and repair bills , gasoline costs , taxes and insurance costs , prison time and lost productivity for DUI and other auto related legal issues , a system that is so ubiquitous it is n't possible in most suburban areas to walk to a convenient store to get a few groceries , and then the costs of fighting in expensive conflicts that masquerade as `` freedom fighting '' to ensure that it can control in same way the costs of oil , the automobile is probably the single biggest waste of money and time ever invented . \nPaintcan -- took a while -- but -- spot on !! seems our society neve gets to the `` bones '' of a problem . \nI look up and see the sun -- literally -- burning -- at no cost to anyone -- burning -- day after day , after day , after day ... Guess it is more fun to create sophisticated weapons to drain blood , limb and life from the body of anyone who dares to stand in the path leading to highly polluting , highly profitable , cheap -LRB- ? -RRB- \nThanks nyman , Solar energy is n't as practical for the northern hemisphere but geo-thermal potential is far more prevalent . \nThe states west of Kansas from Mexico to Canada are all potential sites . \nThe plants are models of simplicity without carbon emissions or toxic waste . \nIt seems the only difficulty is drilling deep enough with a large enough diameter pipe . \nBut fossil fuels need not be outlawed as fuels . \nSome places would always need it . \nMany places and developing countries could and are developing other power sources . \nYou can find maps online charting global geothermal potential . \nBut it 's easy to tell why Qaddafi was a tyrant with off than on again and than off again popularity . \nLibya had enormous cash reserves and the largest oil deposits in Africa . \nThis country and Europe both need cheap oil and will get it and control it any way they can . \nThe rest is a matter of propagandizing their countries into accepting the new political reality . \nIt will be easy to get consensus . \nAll the powers that be have to do , is raise the price at the pumps and the countries will fall over themselves to get to even more benighted brethren who ` need out help '' . \nAny country with massive mineral wealth is a potential target for the new global concern . \nAnd we will all learn to accept the new morality or else . \nWe just have to rescue the Saudi 's the UAE from their ruling dynasts . \nAfter all -- It would n't be hard to sell that idea at all -- especially of overseas development contracts are an avenue for business as usual . \nAnd the market will approve with every new `` victory ' until another one is needed . \nThat 's all we have to do . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nMark Ensalaco is the director of the University of Dayton 's human rights studies program and author of `` Middle Eastern Terrorism : From Black September to September 11 '' . \nHe teaches classes on political violence and transitions of power , and the affect on human rights . \n"}

'' \nNilsson said contacts at Libya 's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- informed him there had been little damage to the oilfields in the east of the country during the six-month power struggle . \n`` We have n't been able to work at the oilfields during the civil war as it has not been safe , but I think within a couple of weeks we could be back to almost normal , '' Nilsson said by telephone from his office in Stockholm . \n`` The oil income is essential to Libya and the new government so they will want to bring it back online as soon as possible . '' \nNilsson said they had several Swedish , Indian and Sudanese employees who had stayed in the country during the civil war , but total staff numbers in the country were down from around 250-300 . \nHe said he expected international employees to start returning to Libya in about a month 's time . \nDAMAGE Oil firm 's who supported the rebel government during the civil war are expected to win the lion 's share of contracts to help relaunch the Libyan oil industry , which before the war produced some 1.6 million barrels per day of crude . \nThose based in countries that were quick to back military action by NATO , including France , Britain and the United States , are thought to be particularly well positioned . \nPA -RRB- , the Paris-based oil services and engineering firm , said it did n't have any employees in Libya at the present time , but it expected to play a role in helping oil and gas companies quickly resume production . \nOil major 's like Italy 's ENI -LRB- ENI . \nMI -RRB- , the largest producer in Libya before the outbreak of fighting , is positioning for an early return to Libya . \nAnalysts said getting production back up to speed quickly could help its `` good will '' with any new government , after it was seen as slow to distance itself from Muammar Gaddafi at the start of the conflict . \nSamuel Ciszuk , Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy said oil fields in the south west of the country had largely escaped the fighting , and said production throughout Libya could rise to 250,000-350 ,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- within three months . \n`` Planning for the post-war recovery seems to be in full swing with both international oil companies -LRB- IOCs -RRB- , as well as oil service companies , starting to prepare for swift deployment of key personnel to assist with production start-ups and repairs , '' Ciszuk said . \n`` In the south-west , where no fighting occurred and where the effects of looting and vandalism are thought to be low , production ... could start rising towards the pre-war 200,000 bpd level perhaps as soon as the pipeline to the coast is repaired and cleaned of potential residues . '' \nThe oil port of Ras Lanuf saw some of the heaviest fighting in the war , but a rebel spokesman said there was no apparent damage to facilities after pro-Gaddafi forces retreated from the area on Tuesday . \n-LRB- ID : nLDE77M0VJ -RRB- NEW OPPORTUNITIES Oil services group Petrofac -LRB- PFC.

{"id": "32", "time": "2011-10-17", "text": "LONDON | Mon Oct 17 , 2011 9:08 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Pro-Gaddafi fighters may resort to hit-and-run guerilla attacks against Libyan politicians , foreign workers and oil installations in the remote southwestern Fezzan district if they are driven from their last bastions , risk consultants say . \nA full-scale insurgency like the one that erupted in Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein by U.S.-led forces is unlikely , but a determined guerrilla campaign could make life difficult for Libya 's new rulers and foreign oil companies considering a return . \n`` Gaddafi supporters will not be able to conduct an insurgency because they do not have the popular support , but they have the technical ability to launch a bombing and assassination campaign against foreigners and NTC leaders , '' said Firas Abi Ali , deputy head of Middle East and North Africa forecasting for Exclusive Analysis . \nForces loyal to Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council are now moving more tanks into the center of Sirte to try to crush the last pocket of resistance by loyalists of ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi in his home town . \nOther loyalists are still holding out in Bani Walid . \nBut guerrilla tactics , used throughout Libyan history against colonial rulers , could stall efforts to rebuild the country after eight months of fighting and ward off foreign oil workers , who are seen as key to restoring output to pre-war levels of 1.6 million barrels per day . \nSuch a strategy would also complicate decisions for foreign airlines and oil companies torn between returning to business and protecting their staff in the heavily-armed and heavily-mined country . \nMany are for now settling for quick meet-and-greet encounters with Libya 's new leaders in Tripoli until they get further assurances on safety . \nControl Risks last week dropped its assessment of the travel risk to Tripoli to `` high '' but the classification remains `` extreme '' in many other parts of the country . \nBut that was before a gunbattle erupted in the Libyan capital on Friday between NTC forces and up to 50 armed supporters of the deposed Gaddafi . \nEven for those who think the gains justify the risks , insurance premiums are high for doing business in a country where NATO has vowed to extend an air-and-sea campaign until at least December . \nAnalysts said that the highest-risk area for attacks was in the oil-rich southwestern Saharan desert region , Fezzan , which was held by pro-Gaddafi fighters until late September . \nFezzan , where many Libyans believe their former leader is in hiding , is home to Eni 's Elephant and Repsol 's Sharara fields . \nTheir combined capacity of around 330,000 bpd is about a fifth of Libya 's total pre-war output . \nWhile the impact on the oil industry in this region would be less than in the Sirte Basin , now deemed to be relatively secure , attacks could still slow or even halt the ramp-up in oil production keenly awaited by cash-strapped Libyan leaders and consumer countries alike . \nControl Risk 's Henry Smith said installations in the remote Fezzan region were an easy target for roaming militia who could strike , then swiftly disappear back into the desert . \n`` The most significant security threats to oil assets are in the Ubari sand sea , broadly between Ghadames , Sabha and Ghat . \nIt is not secure and anyone who has been there will tell you it will remain difficult to police , particularly given the lack of a central security force , '' he said . \nOil facilities have already been attacked by pro-Gaddafi forces this summer , and in September the Ras Lanuf refinery and export terminal in eastern Libya was ambushed and 17 killed despite being behind NTC lines and supposedly protected by the eastern brigades . \n`` There 's a high risk of hit-and-run attacks on oil workers , blowing up pumping stations or shooting down aircraft that carry people and equipment to fields in the Ubari and Murzuq basins , '' said Firas Abi Ali , referring to parts of southwest Libya . \nBoth consultants warned that the risk was higher because of the number of unsecured weapons in the country left over from the conflict , including anti-aircraft missiles . \nTurkish Airlines has resumed commercial flights to Libya despite the no-fly zone but other carriers have been more cautious . \nBritish Airways , for instance saying it would not resume operations before a NATO no-fly zone was lifted . \nEven some Libyan oil workers are apprehensive about returning to desert oilfields after some of the facilities were sabotaged by militia . \n`` If they find out people are here they might come back , '' said an oilfield manager in the region . \n-LRB- Reporting by Emma Farge ;

'' \nThe Tawergha displaced add yet another delicate task to the growing workload of Libya 's interim rulers , the National Transitional Council , -LRB- NTC -RRB- as they try to reunify the country and impose the rule of law amid renewed opposition from Gaddafi loyalists , who launched attacks in the capital Tripoli last week for the first time since it fell in August . \nIt also highlights a potential future division in the post-Gaddafi era as leaders strive to integrate a legion of factions , such as the Tuarag , a black tribe of nomads some of whom still support the ousted leader . \nSome groups have reported arbitrary arrests across the country on suspicion of collusion with the former leader , believed to be somewhere in Libya 's vast southern desert . \nWhile the NTC favors the return of Tawargha 's residents , it admits this will take time . \nBut resolving the issue remains a test of its leadership to come . \nMuch of the city lays in ruins and people in neighboring Misrata say tensions are still too high to allow a return that could spark more violence . \n`` In the end it 's another ghost of Gaddafi -- he paid many of the tribes to fight for him , so now people see black people and immediately assume they support him , even if they do n't , '' said Imad Eddin , an anesthesiologist volunteering at the camp . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThese people were able to live there without all this happening to them until Barack Obama , the French , and British too their racist little pin heads to Africa and did this to them . \nThose countries should do everything , I mean everything it takes to stop this . \nIf they have to OCCUPY WALL STREET in Libya that 's fine but do something about this mess Obama has made . \nMichelle must have made all the decisions in their family while he was sitting around drinking bear and smoking . \nThe West supports mob uprisings and then acts surprised when the mobs start ethnic\\/racial\\/religious cleansing . \nAll these governments and rebels should have been pressed to have democratic transitions before one dollar or euro was provided , one bullet fired , or one bomb dropped , by Western assets . \nThey need to turn off the spigot until these acts cease . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "184", "time": "2011-03-30", "text": "WASHINGTON | Wed Mar 30 , 2011 6:16 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces seeking to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , government officials told Reuters on Wednesday . \nObama signed the order , known as a presidential `` finding '' , within the last two or three weeks , according to government sources familiar with the matter . \nSuch findings are a principal form of presidential directive used to authorize secret operations by the Central Intelligence Agency . \nThis is a necessary legal step before such action can take place but does not mean that it will . \nAs is common practice for this and all administrations , I am not going to comment on intelligence matters , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement . \n`` I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya . '' \nNews that Obama had given the authorization surfaced as the President and other U.S. and allied officials spoke openly about the possibility of sending arms supplies to Gaddafi 's opponents , who are fighting better-equipped government forces . \nThe United States is part of a coalition , with NATO members and some Arab states , which is conducting air strikes on Libyan government forces under a U.N. mandate aimed at protecting civilians opposing Gaddafi . \nInterviews by U.S. networks on Tuesday , Obama said the objective was for Gaddafi to `` ultimately step down '' from power . \nHe spoke of applying `` steady pressure , not only militarily but also through these other means '' to force Gaddafi out . \nObama said the U.S. had not ruled out providing military hardware to rebels . \n`` It 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . \nWe 're looking at all our options at this point , '' he told ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer . \nIn Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted to reporters that no decision had yet been taken . \nU.S. officials monitoring events in Libya say neither Gaddafi 's forces nor the rebels , who have asked the West for heavy weapons , now appear able to make decisive gains . \nWhile U.S. and allied airstrikes have seriously damaged Gaddafi 's military forces and disrupted his chain of command , officials say , rebel forces remain disorganized and unable to take full advantage of western military support . \nPeople familiar with U.S. intelligence procedures said that Presidential covert action `` findings '' are normally crafted to provide broad authorization for a range of potential U.S. government actions to support a particular covert objective . \nIn order for specific operations to be carried out under the provisions of such a broad authorization -- for example the delivery of cash or weapons to anti-Gaddafi forces -- the White House also would have to give additional `` permission '' allowing such activities to proceed . \nFormer officials say these follow-up authorizations are known in the intelligence world as '' ` Mother may I ' findings . '' \nIn 2009 Obama gave a similar authorization for the expansion of covert U.S. counter-terrorism actions by the CIA in Yemen . \nThe White House does not normally confirm such orders have been issued . \nBecause U.S. and allied intelligence agencies still have many questions about the identities and leadership of anti-Gaddafi forces , any covert U.S. activities are likely to proceed cautiously until more information about the rebels can be collected and analyzed , officials said . \n`` The whole issue on -LRB- providing rebels with -RRB- training and equipment requires knowing who the rebels are , '' said Bruce Riedel , a former senior CIA Middle East expert who has advised the Obama White House . \nRiedel said that helping the rebels to organize themselves and training them how use weapons effectively would be more urgent then shipping them arms . \nSending in weapons would arguably violate an arms embargo on Libya by the U.N. Security Council imposed on February 26 , although British , U.S. and French officials have suggested there may be a loophole . \nGetting a waiver would require the agreement of all 15 council members , which is unlikely at this stage . \nDiplomats say any countries that decided to arm the rebels would be unlikely to seek formal council approval . \nAn article in early March on the website of the Voice of America , the U.S. government 's broadcasting service , speculated on possible secret operations in Libya and defined a covert action as `` any U.S. government effort to change the economic , military , or political situation overseas in a hidden way . '' \nThe article , by VOA intelligence correspondent Gary Thomas , said covert action `` can encompass many things , including propaganda , covert funding , electoral manipulation , arming and training insurgents , and even encouraging a coup . '' \nU.S. officials also have said that Saudi Arabia and Qatar , whose leaders despise Gaddafi , have indicated a willingness to supply Libyan rebels with weapons . \nMembers of Congress have expressed anxiety about U.S. government activities in Libya . \nSome have recalled that weapons provided by the U.S. and Saudis to mujahedeen fighting Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s later ended up in the hands of anti-American militants . \nThere are fears that the same thing could happen in Libya unless the U.S. is sure who it is dealing with . \nThe chairman of the House intelligence committee , Rep. Mike Rogers , said on Wednesday he opposed supplying arms to the Libyan rebels fighting Gaddafi `` at this time . '' \n`` We need to understand more about the opposition before I would support passing out guns and advanced weapons to them , '' Rogers said in a statement . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOr maybe his goal is food riots , reduction of large parts of major cities to rubble , and a cart load of dollar bills for a loaf of bread to make a socialist take over easier ... Maybe he 's not just inept , but malevolent . \nAre we arming the next terrorists attack on the US ? \nIf I know Al Qaeda fighers are with the Libyan rebels , SURELY Obama knows Al Qaeda fighers are with the Libyan rebels . \nEither Obama is foolish or he has bad intentions for the United States . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nDozens of rebel vehicles gathered at the western gate to Ajdabiyah , a town which lies about 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nBut rebels did not seem to be regrouping into defensive positions there . \nOne man in military fatigues shouted : `` Civilians inside , civilians inside . '' \nWhen asked what was happening , one rebel said : `` We do n't know . \nThey say there may be a group -LRB- from Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- coming from the south . '' \nTo the south is open desert . \nAjdabiyah , battered by the to-and-fro of fighting , stands at the gateway to the rebel held east of Libya . \nIt is located on a key junction with one route heading to Benghazi and another northeast to the oil port of Tobruk near the Egyptian border . \nLibyan families were fleeing north to Benghazi as news of the retreat spread . \nThe road out of Ajdabiyah was packed with cars carrying families and their belongings . \nRebels had advanced beyond the coastal town of Bin Jawad , about 525 km -LRB- 330 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . \nBut as they approached Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte , they came up against the Libyan leader 's heavier weaponry . \n`` Gaddafi 's forces have Grad -LRB- rockets -RRB- which have a range of 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- ... If we had Grads we could liberate Libya in a day , '' said rebel fighter Ezzedine Saleh . \nAnother fighter , Muftah Mohammed , told Reuters : `` Kalashnikovs , RPGs -LRB- rocket-propelled grenades -RRB- and light rockets -- these are our weapons .

'' \nBut the apparent aerial attack showed no sign of slowing down Gaddafi 's advance or halting the pace of the rebel retreat . \nSome 10-15 km -LRB- 6-10 miles -RRB- west of Brega , around a dozen rebel fighters stopped by the road and trained their guns south into the Sahara . \nWisps of smoke could be seen in the distance . \n`` They -LRB- Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- are coming from the desert , '' yelled one fighter . \nAnother fired his Kalashnikov rifle in the air to scare away a group of camels . \nThere was no sign of the rebels forming any determined defense of the sprawling oil town of Brega . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe fact is that a substantial number of the rebels will include jihadist agitators -LRB- assuming U.S. intel has not relied entirely on Gaddafi 's claims over the past few years -RRB- who have encouraged , supported , incited and even spearheaded the revolution , and will not be without honor in any new government that the West will have to deal with . \nHow does one arrange security and intel with a future government whose security includes Al Qaida or jihadist moles and even open sympathizers ? \nJohn McCain might want also to consider mission-creep against forces that know how to make strategic retreats , how to ambush , how to cache and deploy heavy arms in and around cities -LRB- and just how much they have cached -RRB- , inaccessible to air strikes , how well motivated G 's forces really are , etc. . \nThe U.N. has fashioned a general economic noose for G. , the coalition is striking systematically at his forces ' materiel , and there is no turning back . \nBut there is no reason to ramp it up either . \nThis is a war of attrition , nothing more , nothing less . \nThere has been way too much talking by the coalition diplomats when the Libyan rebels need air power , long range artillery\\/rockets , and tanks . \nAre all these US and NATO Politicians and Military general completely STUPID . \nCommon sense appears in very short supply . \nA civil war is raging in Libya . \nGadhafi has a trained military army . \nThe rebels have no trained military army . \nWE can knock out all Gadhafi 's air power etc but that still leaves his ground soldiers . \nAnd UN 1970 resolution is to protect civilians only . \nSo how do you stop Gadhafi troops when they enter cities without us killing civilians . \nAnswer you need to put `` boots on the ground '' to fight Gadhafi troops and then we have another IRAQ to suck up lives and squander tax dollars . \nAnd the UN resolution 1970 is ignored . \nHas anyone learned any lessons ... . \nAnd remember there are 6 or 7 dictators in countries around Libya who crush their people , so will we bomb them also . \nThese med-evil countries live by the Sharia Law and have been killing each other for centuries . \nThey are not going to stop . \nWe should get the hell out , and let them murder one another . \nOnce their OIL is gone , we will have NO interest in them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAlmost every modern conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Kosovo has served as a test of air power . \nBut the Libyan operation to enforce UN resolution 1973 coincides with a new arms race -- a surge of demand in the $ 60 billion a year global fighter market and the arrival of a new generation of equipment in the air and at sea . \nFor the countries and companies behind those planes and weapons , there 's no better sales tool than real combat . \nFor air forces facing cuts , it is a strike for the value of air power itself . \n`` As soon as an aircraft or weapon is used on operational deployment , that instantly becomes a major marketing ploy ; it becomes ` proven in combat ' , '' says a former defense export official with a NATO country , speaking on condition of anonymity about the sensitive subject . \nA spokesman for the Eurofighter consortium said it had `` never been involved in talks to sell the aircraft to Libya '' and its presence at the Lavex air show outside Tripoli in 2009 was part of an Italian delegation organised at government level . \nDefense sources tell Reuters that Britain and Germany had vetoed any sale of Italian Typhoons to Libya , but the amount of other Italian military hardware on display demonstrated warm relations at the time between Tripoli and the government of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . \nFrance has been less timid about announcing arms talks with Libya which briefly held an exclusive option for Rafale jets . \nA French source , who asked not to be named , declined to comment in detail on past negotiations but said arms sales were handled at a government-to-government level . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "303", "time": "2011-07-07", "text": "TRIPOLI | Thu Jul 7 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Thursday he was against NATO intervention in Libya but had to go along with it , an admission that exposed the fragility of the alliance trying to unseat Muammar Gaddafi . \nNATO warplanes have been bombing Libya under a U.N. mandate , but the alliance is under mounting strain because of the cost of the operation and the failure , after more than three months , to produce a decisive outcome . \n`` I was against this measure , '' Berlusconi said . \n`` I had my hands tied by the vote of the parliament of my country . \nBut I was against and I am against this intervention which will end in a way that no-one knows . '' \nSome of the alliance bombing missions over Libya take off from military airbases in Italy . \nThere was no suggestion following Berlusconi 's comments that Rome would withdraw the use of the bases . \nBut Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa said that the cost to Italy of the Libya operation would fall from 142 million euros in the first half of the year to less than 60 million euros in the second half as part of general defense spending cuts . \nHe said after a cabinet meeting on Thursday the aircraft carrier Garibaldi with three aircraft on board had been withdrawn , and their tasks would be taken on by land-based aircraft . \nThe comments from Rome came just a day after Libyan rebels made a big push toward Tripoli on two fronts . \nSpeaking at a book presentation in Rome , Berlusconi said : `` I went to Paris and I said -- I can repeat this -- I would have stood with Mrs Merkel as far as this decision to intervene in the no fly zone is concerned . '' \nHe appeared to be referring to a March 19 meeting at which several Western powers decided to launch the military intervention . \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel chose not to involve her country in the operation . \n`` We posed very precise questions to the protagonists of this initiative -- that 's to say President Sarkozy and Prime Minister David Cameron -- in the most recent meeting of the heads of government in Brussels , '' he said . \n`` The answer was that the war will end when there is , as we expect , a revolt by the population of Tripoli against the current regime . '' \nA move to stop funding for President Barack Obama 's military intervention in Libya was narrowly defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives . \nBoth political parties split over the measure , highlighting how tensions over U.S. involvement in Libya 's civil war have crossed party lines and created unusual alliances . \nRepublicans and Democrats argued that President Obama violated the U.S. Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Resolution by failing to secure congressional authorization for U.S. military operations in the north African country . \nGaddafi has rejected any suggestion that he will give up power and he has described the NATO campaign as an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libya 's oil . \nPotentially adding to the pressure on Italy to review its stance on Libya , a senior Libyan government spokesman said negotiations had begun with Russian and Chinese firms to take over the role of Italian energy firm ENI in oil and gas projects . \nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Gaddafi -- who has dismissed rebels trying to end his four-decade rule as criminals and vermin -- to listen to the will of the people . \n`` We are far from reaching an agreement to reach an end to the conflict but the negotiating process is ongoing , '' Ban told reporters in Geneva . \n`` He -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- has to listen much more attentively and seriously what would be the best for the future of the Libyan people . '' \nRebel fighters trying to advance toward the capital Tripoli launched offensives on two fronts on Wednesday and made significant gains . \nBut analysts said the advances were not yet enough to shift the military balance against Gaddafi . \nIn the Western Mountains southwest of Tripoli , fighters pushed pro-Gaddafi forces out of the village of al-Qawalish , clearing the way for them to try to seize control of the main highway heading north to the capital . \nColonel Juma Ibrahim , a rebel commander in the nearby town of Zintan , said seven rebel fighters were killed in the operation and 30 wounded . \nHe said the capture of al-Qawalish meant other villages and towns in the region were no longer in the range of government rockets and artillery . \n`` It will let the people return to their houses , '' he said . \nThe slow push toward the capital would continue , he said . \n`` All fronts are quiet . \nEach side is making preparations for the next round . \nThis is the quiet before the storm . '' \nA rebel spokesman in Nalut by the border with Tunisia said a rebel tank hit and destroyed a loyalist car carrying weapons north of the rebel-held town . \nFurther north , on Libya 's Mediterranean coast , rebel fighters on Wednesday advanced west from Misrata to within about 13 km of Zlitan -- one of a chain of government-controlled towns blocking their advance to Tripoli . \nA Reuters reporter near the front line on Thursday said there was now a lull in the fighting , although he could hear a few explosions . \nRebels at the front will need more ammunition , a minister with the National Transitional Council said while on a visit to Misrata . \n`` There is enough to run the front for the time being but we need more , '' Minister of Health Nagi Barakah said at a news conference . \nGaddafi 's military capabilities have been severely hurt by the bombing , NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said . \nNATO had `` degraded Gaddafi 's military capacity to the point that he is no longer capable of running any major military operation , '' he said . \nThere were also signs Gaddafi may try to turn Friday prayers in Tripoli into a pro-government demonstration . \nLibyan TV broadcast calls from tribal leaders urging people in the capital to gather at the city 's Green Square for prayers . \nA post on a Facebook page used by anti-Gaddafi activists said it was possible the authorities would close mosques in the capital to force people to gather in the square . \nHowever , anti-Gaddafi rebels received a fresh diplomatic boost when China sent a senior diplomat to meet the rebel leadership in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . \nThe visit by Chen Xiaodong , China 's foreign ministry chief for North African affairs , was the second official meeting between China and Libyan opposition leaders in less than a month . \n`` China believes that the present situation can not go on and a political resolution to find a way out of the Libyan crisis must be found as soon as possible , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular news briefing in Beijing . \nThere were reports this week that Gaddafi -- under pressure from the five-month-old uprising against his rule , sanctions and the NATO bombing campaign -- was seeking a deal under which he would step down . \nHis government has denied any such negotiations are underway , and NATO 's chief said he had no confirmation that Gaddafi was looking for a deal to relinquish power . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe may have been against the invasion , as I think Italy probably was , but Berlusconi is little more than a rich businessman with a loud mouth . \nBerlusconi is feeling the pressure from ENI , not China , on the non-advancement of the situation in Libya . \nBut his biggest problem is his coalition 's partner in Government who have given him a deadline to withdraw from the Libya intervention , given public opinion in Italy who was never favourable to this war . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` It 's extraordinarily important that we stop the erosion of the war-making authority of the Congress of the United States , that we end this ill-advised adventure in Libya and that we reassert the rightful place of this institution in conducting war , authorizing it and funding it , '' he said . \nSenator John McCain , a fellow Republican , acknowledged frustration over Obama 's lack of consultation with Congress over the conflict but said the vote to bar funding for `` freedom fighters in Libya is deeply disturbing . '' \n`` This action sends the wrong message to both -LRB- Libyan leader Muammar -RRB- Gaddafi and those fighting for freedom and democracy in Libya -- especially with Gaddafi is clearly crumbling , '' McCain said . \nThe House , in a 316-111 vote , also approved a measure barring the Pentagon from using funds from the 2012 defense spending bill on anything that violates the War Powers Resolution , which requires the president to seek congressional approval within 60 days of committing U.S. forces to a conflict . \nSPONSORED BY MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES On a vote of 199-229 , the House rejected the proposal to block defense funds in fiscal year 2012 , which begins October 1 , for U.S. military participation in the NATO-led mission against Gaddafi 's forces . \nThe failed measure 's sponsors were Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich and Republican Representative Justin Amash . \n`` We are at war , '' Amash argued before the vote . \n`` The Constitution vests Congress with the exclusive power to declare war . '' \nHe said it was embarrassing to hear the Obama administration 's `` flimsy '' arguments for being involved in Libya but it would be even more embarrassing if Congress did nothing about its constitutional role being ignored . \n`` We must stand up and say stop . '' \nBut Representative Norm Dicks , a Democrat , said it would be wrong to undermine the president , as well as NATO allies involved in the war , by cutting off funds for it . \nHe said the administration estimated the conflict would cost the United States a little more than $ 1 billion by September 30 . \nRepresentative Bill Young , a Republican , said there were no funds in the fiscal 2012 defense spending bill for Libya anyway , because the administration had said that it was taking the money from the `` base budget '' that had already been appropriated in the current fiscal year . \nThe House has held several votes on the Libyan operation . \nLast month it defeated another move to curb the intervention , while also refusing to formally authorize the U.S. participation . \nThe Senate has yet to take any votes on the war , although a resolution to authorize the U.S. role has passed a committee . \nThe House actions reflect growing war fatigue among lawmakers after almost a decade of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq that have cost more than $ 1 trillion and have helped fuel a $ 1.4 trillion budget deficit . \nThe United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission against Libya more than three months ago , aiming to prevent Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians in regions opposed to his rule . \nThe mission now appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power . \n"}

'' \nLibyan state television said later that four people were killed in a NATO air strike on `` civilian and military targets '' in the Bir al-Ghanam area southwest of the capital Tripoli . \nThere were `` losses in property and farmland , '' it said . \nLieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Libya operations , advised Libyan civilians to keep away from Gaddafi 's forces to help NATO carry out effective air strikes . \nHundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata , where aid groups say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food and medical supplies . \nEvidence surfaced on Wednesday that Gaddafi 's government is dodging U.N. sanctions to import gasoline to western Libya using intermediaries who transfer the fuel between ships in Tunisia , a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters . \nOne intermediary company , Hong Kong-based Champlink , previously unknown to the oil trading community , has sought a transaction for fuel delivery into Libya , according to a fax obtained by Reuters , and European oil traders said they had been approached by other such firms . \nIn Paris , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who has spearheaded U.N.-backed NATO intervention , pledged stronger military action at his first meeting with the leader of the opposition Libyan National Council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil . \n`` We are indeed going to intensify the attacks and respond to this request from the national transition council , '' an official in the president 's office said , quoting Sarkozy as telling Abdel Jalil : `` We will help you . '' \nHe did not say how NATO-led forces planned to overcome the stalemate on the ground after the United States and several European allies declined last week to join ground strikes . \nA French military sources said Sarkozy had won approval from NATO to carry out more air strikes and France had moved six fighter jets from Corsica to the southern Greek island of Crete , closer to Libya , for that purpose . \nItaly , the former colonial power in Libya that has provided air bases for the NATO mission but says its own planes will not open fire , said it may send 10 military trainers as part of increased Western efforts to help the badly pressured rebels . \nPresident Barack Obama still opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , the White House said on Wednesday , but he supports a French and British move to dispatch military advisors to help rebels fighting Gaddafi . \nVice President Joe Biden insisted in an interview with the Financial Times that U.S. strike aircraft , requested by France , were not needed to achieve the alliance 's goal in Libya . \n`` If the Lord Almighty extricated the U.S. out of NATO and dropped it on the planet of Mars so we were no longer participating , it is bizarre to suggest that NATO and the rest of the world lacks the capacity to deal with Libya -- it does not , '' he was quoted as saying . \n`` Occasionally other countries lack the will , but this is not about capacity , '' Biden said . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton has recommended $ 25 million in commodities and services for Libyan rebels that would not include weapons , the State Department said . \nObama still must sign off on this provision of aid such as radios , body armor and halal ready-to-eat-meals , spokesman Mark Toner said . \nWestern officials say NATO is attacking only military targets consistent with the alliance 's U.N. mandate to impose a no-fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces . \nRebels want NATO to go much further and provide close air support so they can break a prolonged battlefield stalemate . \nAbdel Jalil told reporters he had invited Sarkozy to pay a visit to the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi to demonstrate France 's support for ending Gaddafi 's autocratic rule . \n`` I think that would be extremely important for the morale of the revolution , '' he said . \nFrench officials did not say if the president had accepted . \nGaddafi 's son , Saif al-Islam , was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as saying the government would prevail over the rebels and a new constitution was ready for when the insurgency was vanquished . \n`` Libya will not go back to what it was , '' it quoted him as saying on Libyan state television . \n`` The era of the first Jamahiriya -LRB- people 's republic -RRB- is gone and a new draft constitution has been prepared . '' \nThe rebels say forces loyal to Gaddafi have been bombarding Misrata heavily over the last week . \nIn signs of hardship , there are long queues for petrol and electricity has been cut so residents depend on generators . \nThousands of stranded foreign migrant workers are awaiting rescue in the port area . \nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said the Libyan government 's reported use of cluster munitions and heavy weapons in Misrata may amount to a war crime under international law . \nThe government denies it is attacking civilians in Misrata . \nFrance 's decision to send up to 10 military advisers to work with the rebels came a day after Britain , the other main leader of the coalition , announced a similar move . \nGovernment spokesman Francois Baroin stressed France had no intention of sending troops into Libya , where Western powers are struggling to break a deadlock in a two-month-old conflict . \nThe French officers are expected to advise rebel leaders on how to organize their ragtag forces , now struggling against Gaddafi 's better-armed and - trained army . \nThey will also liaise with NATO on the location of rebels and Gaddafi 's troops . \nAsked whether the dispatch of liaison officers amounted to `` mission creep , '' military analyst Jean-Dominique Merchet said it was only a small team and they would not be training fighters but advising their senior officers . \n`` It 's about putting a bit of organization into the rebel forces . \nIt 's the French and the British doing this , it 's clear that NATO is not very keen , nor the Americans , '' he said . \nIndependent defense analyst Paul Beaver said the decision to send military advisers was stretching the U.N. resolution . \n`` But I think without it the rebels are going to be so disorganized that we will have a stalemate in what is almost a civil war now , '' Beaver said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPut the statues back up . \nIt is shameful that the world lets this continue . \nLeaflets , safe passage for the mercinaries and 800 troops with Blackhawks and the Seige would be over . \nA ragrag of rebels egged on by the CIA , and next thing our sons and daughters will be over there losing their lives for banks and corps profits . \nThe rebels are breaking international law by being in a city and using civilians as human shields . \nShrapnel wounds could be from either side . \nIts about time the rebels left the city and the world woke up to another money grab . \nI can still remember Thatchers son trying to take over an oil rich country with his paid mercanaries . \nProbably a similar case here . \nEnough propaganda ... stop showing only ragtags that scatter after one shot ... show the damage and scarred bodies left after the `` humanitarian '' nato bombings as well ...

'' \nBut while many analysts believe there is widespread discontent with Gaddafi in western Libya , he may have enough troops and equipment to crush urban pockets of resistance and deter protesters from taking to the streets in the capital . \nHis chances of demolishing the eastern opposition may be tougher , however , reflecting partly distance from the capital , but also deep-rooted differences between the historic provinces of Cyrenaica , around Benghazi , and Tripolitania , which Italian colonial rulers united to create modern Libya 80 years ago . \n`` The area around Benghazi has always been the center of resistance against both the Gaddafi regime and before it the Italian occupation , '' said Smith at Control Risks . \nThe eastern rebels have taken the flag of the old monarchy from Cyrenaica , ousted by Gaddafi in a military coup in 1969 . \nGaddafi has long relied heavily on members of his own Gaddadfa tribe from around Sirte , using them in key positions particularly in core `` regime protection '' units . \nBut he has also built alliances with other groups through marriage and important government appointments . \nThat has allowed him to weather previous tribal uprisings by groups such as the eastern-based Warfalla , widely seen as Libya 's largest tribe . \nTogether with the second largest tribal group , the Margarha , they rebelled in 1993 against Gaddafi demanding greater representation in government . \nThe revolt failed and a number of Warfalla leaders were killed , imprisoned or driven into exile -- although experts say they still retain a considerable presence within the military . \nAfter negotiations behind closed doors , the Margarha were able to maintain better ties with Gaddafi . \nHowever , many believe loyalties in the final analysis will also come down to more immediate personal decisions and relationships as commanders and leaders wait to back the winning side . \nMany tribes themselves break down into multiple subgroups . '' \n`` We 've seen various statements from various figures about the loyalty of their tribes , but it 's far from clear that structures are that simple , '' said Control Risks ' Smith . \n`` There will be a lot of people aiming to sit on the sidelines to see which way things go .

'' \nThe battlefield in eastern Libya around important oil terminals has become mired in attack and counter-attack between the loose-knit rebel army of young volunteers and defectors and the Libyan armed forces in a buffer zone of barren landscape between the east and the west of Libya . \nThe largely inexperienced rebels lack the firepower of their rivals . \nThey have no warplanes to back them up and rely mostly on heavy machineguns , anti-aircraft weapons and rocket propelled grenades . \nThey travel by 4x4 pick-up trucks . \nBut their agility , often fairly chaotic at the front , has given them a degree of protection from Gaddafi 's forces , who have proved more effective at quashing the rebellion in the west around the Libyan leader 's Tripoli powerbase . \nU.N. aid coordinator Valerie Amos said the fighting across Libya meant that more than a million people fleeing or inside the country needed humanitarian aid . \n`` Humanitarian organizations need urgent access now , '' she said . \n`` People are injured and dying and need help immediately . '' \nThe United Nations appealed for $ 160 million for an operation over the next months to prepare shelter , food and medicine . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said London was working with its partners `` on elements of a resolution on a no-fly zone , making clear the need for regional support , a clear trigger for such a resolution and an appropriate legal basis '' . \nA French source said France also was working with its U.N. partners on a no-fly zone resolution . \nGulf states called for a no-fly zone and an urgent Arab League meeting . \nWestern allies differ over how a no-fly zone might be implemented . \nThe United States has said it would involve a large-scale military operation , including strikes on Libyan air defences , but some military analysts have said it could be limited to preventing flights in Libyan airspace , without a big preliminary campaign . \nU.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , in Afghanistan where foreign forces have struggled for a decade , said action should be taken only with international backing . \nThe White House said all options were on the table , including arming rebels . \nRussia , a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with veto powers , said it opposed foreign military intervention . \nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stressed the need for U.N. authorisation . \n`` I ca n't imagine the international community and the United Nations would stand idly by if Gaddafi and his regime continue to attack their own people , '' he said . \nNATO has launched 24-hour surveillance of Libya with AWACS reconnaissance aircraft , the U.S. ambassador to NATO said . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals '' . \nAs the international community sought to isolate Gaddafi 's government , Japan said on Tuesday it had imposed sanctions on Libya , including freezing assets of Gaddafi and several other Libyans , in line with a U.N. Security Council resolution . \n`` Based on the U.N. resolution , the cabinet agreed that Japan would carry out these measures , for the sake of unity with the international community , '' Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting . \nIn the rebel-held city of Misrata , the wounded were being treated on hospital floors because of a catastrophic shortage of medical facilities in the besieged city , a resident said . \nMisrata is the biggest city in the west not under the control of Gaddafi , and its stand against a militia commanded by his own son has turned it into a symbol of defiance . \nZawiyah , just 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , was in rebel hands despite a government forces ' push , Sky television said . \nIn the east , warplanes launched strikes on the rebel-held oil town of Ras Lanuf 600 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . \nOne ripped through a car carrying a family . \nShipping sources said the fighting had closed the Ras Lanuf terminal and the oil port of Brega . \nBrent crude prices rose above $ 118 a barrel on Monday before falling back to $ 115 and U.S. prices pushed to their highest level since September 2008 . \nYoucef Yousfi , president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries , said there were no plans for a crisis meeting of the group and high prices were short term . \nThe Libyan government says it is fighting against al Qaeda terrorists and maintains its security forces have targeted only armed individuals attacking state institutions and depots . \nAl Jazeera quoted sources from the rebel interim council as saying it rejected Gaddafi 's proposal to quit because it would have been an `` honorable '' exit for him . \nThe channel said Gaddafi had wanted guarantees of safety for him and his family and a pledge they not be put on trial . \nJadallah Azous Al-Talhi , a former prime minister , earlier appeared on state television to urge rebels to `` give a chance to national dialogue to resolve this crisis '' . \nAhmed Jabreel , an aide to rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil , said : `` Any negotiations must be on the basis that Gaddafi will step down . \nThere can be no other compromise . '' \nSo far tens of thousands of migrant workers have fled but few Libyans . \n`` If we get a massive outflow of Libyans , this would create a refugee situation , so we appeal to all countries to keep their doors open and be ready to provide assistance as humanitarian law requires , '' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said . \n"}

{"id": "157", "time": "2011-03-08", "text": "In a report this month calling for faster progress on a political settlement on Afghanistan , the influential UK parliamentary foreign affairs committee was unusually critical of the dominance of the military in setting Afghan policy . \n`` We conclude that there are grounds for concern over the relationship between the military and politicians . \nWe further conclude that this relationship has , over a number of years , gone awry and needs to be re-calibrated ... we believe that problems in Afghanistan highlight the need for a corresponding cultural shift within Whitehall to ensure that those charged with taking foreign policy decisions and providing vitally important political leadership are able to question and appraise military advice with appropriate vigor , '' it said . \nDuring its enquiries , based on interviews with regional experts and officials , `` we gained the impression that the sheer size and power of the U.S. military ensured that the U.S. military remained largely in control of U.S. Afghan policy , '' it added . \nIt also quoted former UK special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles , as saying that conversations between the U.S. and British military end up with things being pre-cooked between the U.S. and the UK militaries before they are subject to political approval back in London ... '' `` In Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles s view , the war in Afghanistan gave the British Army a raison d tre it has lacked for many years , new resources on an unprecedented scale and a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the U.S. following criticisms about the army s performance in Basra , Iraq . '' \nThe comments in the report struck me as interesting , primarily because they were included at all -- `` civ-mil '' relations are not usually a hot topic for political debate in Britain . \nOtherwise they seemed to be largely a reflection of a far more heated discussion in Washington over the extent to which the U.S. military has come to dominate American foreign policy in the years following the Sept 11 , 2001 attacks and during two major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nFor recent articles on the subject see Stephen Walt at Foreign Policy or Franz-Stefan Gady at the Small Wars Journal -LRB- pdf -RRB- For some time now , it has become conventional wisdom that the military has dominated strategy in Afghanistan -- when the army asked President Barack Obama for more troops , they got them . \nAnd the pundit consensus has been that Obama , after sacking two generals , had little room for maneuver even if he wanted to challenge the decisions made by his commander , the politically powerful General David Petraeus . \nBut to what extent is this actually true ? \nOr perhaps more to the point , how far is the perceived dominance of the military a consequence rather than a cause of civilian weakness in setting foreign policy ? \nInk Spots blog argues that the crisis in Libya provides an opportunity to at least reassess thinking on the perceived dominance of the military . '' \nOne of the interesting aspects of the recent turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa is a reversal of militarisation . \nMany politicians have been calling for military intervention , particularly in Libya , and it has been the military pouring cold water on great ideas . \nHow does this phenomenon fit into our understanding of civil-military relations at the national government level ? \nI 'm not sure yet , but I think it speaks volumes ... To extend the argument further , one of the problems in setting policy for Afghanistan -LRB- and the same applies to Pakistan , India and Kashmir -RRB- has been the lack of knowledge in the United States about the countries it aims to influence , whether by military or diplomatic means -- as eloquently argued by Manan Ahmed in The National and Joshua Foust at Registan.net . \nFar easier , then , to rely on military might . \nYet that brings us to another peculiarity of the Libyan situation . \nFew people know very much about Libya since the country has been closed off for so long . \nSo while there are plenty of arguments out there for and against military intervention , one of the less contested points is that it would not be terribly effective if you do n't know enough about the side you are backing , or about the potential consequences of that action . \nAnd as argued here , even a no-fly zone requires quite a lot of knowledge about what is happening on the ground if you do n't want to end up hitting the wrong targets , or jumping into unknown territory to rescue anyone who had been shot down . \nSo which would you say came first ? \nCivilian lack of knowledge , or military power ? \nAs a caveat , some would argue that the military has sucked up so many resources that there has been little left to develop civilian expertise . \nAnd that after two major wars , the U.S. military has little appetite or resources for intervening in yet another country . \nBut in any case , food for thought . \n-LRB- Photo : A rebel fighter fires his rifle at a military aircraft loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at a checkpoint in Ras Lanuf March 7 , 2011 . \nREUTERS\\/Goran Tomasevic -RRB- One is reminded of Robert McNamara 's attempts to predict VietCong attacks using mainframe-based computer models . \nReal-life is much more messy -LRB- `` non-linear '' , in the words of the experts analyzing why those models failed -RRB- . \nPerhaps India should get bolder and increase its influence in Afghanistan . \nIf a knowledge of local languages , dialects and customs is vitally important to understanding a culture and providing reliable intelligence , Indians would arguably be better at negotiating these than a Westerner . \nAlso , given that there is a better inherent convergence of interests between the Indian and Afghan people than between the Afghans and other parties -LRB- the West , Russia , China or Pakistan -RRB- , this would be something worth exploring . \nSuch a labour-intensive -LRB- HUMINT -RRB- rather than technology-intensive approach to intelligence also plays to India 's strengths . \nOf course , it will give the Pakistanis apoplexy , but that should n't be a concern . \nProxy wars are the best course to take when one can not engage foreign military directly . \nFor example , in Indian Kashmir , Pakistan tried direct military action and it did not help . \nBut it started a proxy war and over a decade 's time , the tide had turned in favor of Pakistan and put India on the defensive . \nThe Soviet Union engaged in Afghanistan directly and it was defeated by proxy war engagement . \nIt is easier to engage two local parties against each other rather than come in directly and take the brunt of everything . \nIn Iraq the US committed a blunder by direct engagement . \nIt would have been easier to use Saddam Hussein to turn on the throttle against Iran and contain it rather than draw him into Kuwait and wage two direct wars against him . \nAt the end the US achieved nothing . \nThe Chinese always engage in proxy methods to contain its adversaries . \nChina has surrounded itself with a bunch of rogue nations it calls as string of pearls and has quietly supported the regimes in those countries . \nIn 2001 , when Al Qaeda attacked New York , it would have been prudent to bomb the Taliban out of Afghanistan and immediately engage the Northern alliance to complete the chase and control of the region . \nAnd NA could have been provided with all logistics and support to carry out the proxy war against the Taliban and its backers . \nWith coercive diplomacy and sanctions on Pakistan , its efforts in backing the Taliban against the NA could have been contained . \nThey all are locals and know the game and the terrain very well . \nThis would have save a lot of money and efforts . \nOnce in a while when it appears like Taliban gaining ground , a few missiles and drone strikes could have softened them up , forcing them to seek truce with NA . \nThere would have been no need for setting up a puppet government in Kabul and chase the rats in the unknown territory . \nIn Libya , anti-Gadhaffi factions could have been backed using proxy elements and with time , he could have been taken out by his own people . \nPeople feared the British empire because no one could predict which side they would support in every conflict . \nThey support one side for sometime and dump them to make new alliances . \nSo they made the proxy groups vie with each other for British support and gained control over both parties . \nProxy wars are the way to contain territorial issues in geo-strategic hot spots . \nOne reason why Pakistan desperately wants India out of Afghanistan is the potential for gains in the future where India will be able to weaken Pakistan 's proxy efforts . \nIndia can counter Pakistan 's efforts in Kashmir by pinching it from Afghanistan . \nAn economically weak Pakistan will not be able to sustain proxy wars for too long . \nA lot of civil wars are looming in the horizon . \nIt would be great if people take to revolution in North Korea , China , Burma , Cuba etc to throw out autocratic governments . \nAnd they can be helped by proxy means to achieve that goal . \nCould you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . \nCould you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . \nI was hoping you 'd ask . \nFor a start , it might help to see what Afghans seem to think about this , rather than go by the opinion of one -LRB- obviously biased -RRB- Indian poster on this blog . \n-LRB- It also says a lot about the `` brotherhood '' we keep hearing about . \nYou know , brotherhood is as brotherhood does . -RRB- \nAnd if you want more detail , the convergence of interests has to do with many things , notably trade . \nAfghanistan needs roads , dams , bridges , schools , hospitals -- lots of infrastructural development that India has been helping with . \nIt 's more of a win-win arrangement than the patently self-serving approach of other countries , which gets reflected in popularity surveys . \nI guess the Afghans are not happy to be used as some other country 's defense shield . \nThey 're happier when other countries do things for them that they want . \nDefense analyst Christine Fair has a couple of pieces on this relationship : I hope that answers your question . \nRight now the whole middle-east is too fluid and Pak-American spat over Davis is going to reset the relations . \nSo I would hold my thoughts for a few days . \nMeanwhile , you work out your plans for Afghanistan . \nIn terms of the US military , we do have to look at the last eight years . \nPresident Bush had a policy of mostly saying yes to the generals , and the pentagon . \nThis behavior continued for eight years and the US military got used to having its way . \nObama Wars by Woodward rightfully points this out . \nObama was up against a whole different system when he decided to change things around in the Af-Pak policy . \nThe generals were not used to having long policy discussions , and were not used to being asked to `` do more with less '' . \nThe author is right that US could use more intimate knowledge of the South Asian actors . \nHowever , we have to go one step further . \nIt is well known that the US , & Pakistan have divergent interests . \nUnless one of the two is willing to shift their fundamental focus , no amount of intimate knowledge of each other will help anyone . \nIn the interm , the militaries fill the gaps and execute policy . \nThe militaries are n't concerned with convergence , or divergence of interests . \nThey have their mission goals , and they execute accordingly . \nProxy wars are only good in the short term , and totally effective if they can reach a tipping point . \nHowever , with bigger countries like India which can sustain localized trouble , the proxy wars because part of the cost of doing business . \nCase in point : Kashmir . \nMoreover , proxy wars are costly , and unpredictable . \nI would also add India to the list of countries you 've given that might be possible candidates for civil war . \nThere is a civil war going on in central India with the Maoists -LRB- calling them an insurgency does n't change the reality -RRB- . \nBut again , situation is manageable because of the size of India . \nBiased or not , I state only my opinions and do not claim to represent anyone . \nCould you explain the convergence of -LRB- national -RRB- interests between Indian and Afghan people in some detail . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- Pakistan and Sri Lanka Do you share any of the following links with either one of the above countries ? \n: We can discuss the interests of Pakistani people with nationals of Nepal . \nHigh-quality fake Indian currency printed at Pakistani government press is released into India through Nepal . \nOther pakistani interests in Nepal involve money laundering , drug trafficking , slipping in trained terrorists , and hosting pakistani hijackers at the Pakistani embassy to hijack Indian airlines flight . \nAccording to a top US military official , Lashkar-e-Taiba -LRB- LeT -RRB- , the Pakistani terrorist organization , is quickly expanding operations to South Asian countries other than India including Nepal . \nIn his opening statement , Admiral Willard said , The Asia Pacific region is quickly becoming the strategic nexus of the globe due to its economic expansion and great potential . \nIn regard to Nepal , the Admiral reported , `` Right now our concern is the movement of Lashkar-e Taiba , the terrorist group that emanates from Pakistan that was responsible for the Mumbai attacks in India , and specifically their positioning in Bangladesh and Nepal , the Maldives and Sri Lanka . '' \nSenator George Lemieux asked about the dynamics of the Indo-American partnership in combating LeT terrorism . \nAdmiral Willard s response : We are working very closely with the Indians and we are working within our own community to develop the necessary plans to counter that particular terrorist group as they migrate into the Asia Pacific region . \nI think the poll stats , referred by Ganesh , are most telling . \nIt 's a scientific poll conducted 3 reputable international organizations & includes all ethnic groups of Afghanistan -LRB- not just Pashtuns or non-Pashtuns -RRB- . \nThe fact that 74 % Afghans have a favorable opinion of India & just 8 % , of Pakistan AND 91 % have an unfavorable opinion of Pakistan whereas 21 % view India unfavorably , should put to bed any argument , as to which country has the moral right to be in Afghanistan . \nThe US seems to be looking for a way to do a 180-degree turn on Pakistan without losing face , but have not yet found one . \n-LRB- Of course , this could be wishful thinking by an Indian , but I do hear increasing rumblings . -RRB- \nGen Kayani is by his own admission , the most anti-Indian general in recent times . \n`` India-centric '' is a euphemism for `` I joined the Pakistan army on the eve of its greatest defeat in 1971 , and I 'll never forgive you , you b \\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\* s ! '' \nTo give him his due , he has so far masterfully translated this attitude into gains for Pakistan , although his simultaneous anti-US actions could be his undoing . \nManmohan Singh is the softest Indian PM on Pakistan in recent memory . \nThis probably owes much to his birth in Pakistan -LRB- before partition -RRB- and his desire to achieve a peace treaty -LRB- and possibly a Nobel Peace Prize -RRB- before he leaves office . \nThere is the real danger -LRB- from India 's perspective -RRB- that he will give away the store in pursuit of this quest . \nCertainly he is not exploiting India 's strengths in the shrewdest way possible . \nAll three factors are temporary , I believe , and will not last beyond 3 years . \nOnce the US withdraws from Afghanistan -LRB- at least substantially by 2014 -RRB- , they can simultaneously disengage themselves from the last vestiges of dependence on Pakistan and thenceforth say and do as they please . \nGen Kayani 's term -LRB- after the extension -RRB- ends in 3 years , in 2013 . \nHopefully , the next general will be more genuinely professional . \nManmohan Singh has stated he will not be seeking a fresh term . \nAny government after the 2014 elections will be more aware of India 's strength and more willing to use it to pursue India 's interests , unburdened by personal childhood sentiment . \nThe three-way relationship will then find a new equilibrium . \nOnce the US withdraws from Afghanistan -LRB- at least substantially by 2014 -RRB- , they ... . \nGen Kayani s term -LRB- after the extension -RRB- ends in 3 years , in 2013 . \nHopefully , the next general will be more genuinely professional . \nManmohan Singh has stated he will not be seeking a fresh term . \nAny government after the 2014 ... . '' \nAgree with # 1 & 3 , not sure about # 2 . \nAlso , I hope that next Indian PM is not of the pre-1947 generation who carries the burden of the partition . \nWe need some fresh eyes to look at Pakistan & deal with it . \nNo more Manmohan Singhs or Advanis please . \nIt 's time for venom against hinduism , now . \n-LRB- 2 -RRB- What the fuXX is purushamedha ? \nPlease explain how the fuXX it affects day to day lives of a paki when he is not contemplating bombing his neighbor . \n-LRB- 10 marks , bonus 5 marks for elucidating Quaid s role in this holy mess -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- Explain varnashrama dharma in the context of current existential nightmare that is called Pakistan -LRB- 4 -RRB- Describe in detail the nuances , fundamental principles of tantra . \nPlease explain how it affects the depraved lives of paki momina -LRB- 5 -RRB- Why sati is relevant to sorry paki lives in the 21st century ? \nExplain how Pakistan studies curriculum makes you obsessed about it . \n-LRB- 6 -RRB- Describe why paki is today left to do nothing but beg and indulge in terrorism while explaining lingam and yoni -LRB- 7 -RRB- Is paki worth for anything else besides begging and terrorism in the 21st century ? \nPlease elaborate with the along the principles kamasutra Experiment - Demonstrate how you will indulge in suicide bombing of anyone experiencing the misfortune of living in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan . \nDemonstrate how you will suicide bomb a Sunni , Shia , Ahmadiya , Pashtun , Mohajir , Punjabi , Seraiki , Baluchi , Sindhi , Hindu , Christian , Parsi , Sikh , or a hapless visiting gora . \nYou have to admit netizen 's latest post is at least as funny as your series of amu-Singh jokes . \nI always felt , you were somewhat queer Shahidkhan : `` you read a lot but understand little . \nMuslims don t need money or economy , they volunteer for free . \nWould an Indian volunteer for free ? \nLOL LOL LOL .

'' \nIn 1989 they did that . \nThey demolished the USSR and went home to work on the new world order . \nLittle did they know at that time that they will be forced to come back to this garbage pile a decade later . \nThis time if they go , they will be laughed at as losers . \nThere are enough people in Af-Pak who are experts at writing distorted history . \nThey might decide to blackmail the US by going rogue if the US does not give them money . \nThat is probably why they are building nukes at the expense of everything else . \nThey can blackmail US business by pointing their Jihadist barrel at India . \nThe US has to remove the nukes from this country . \nOtherwise there is going to be no peace in this region . \nThe Military has a tendency to produce more balanced , sound and efficient leaders . \nTheir physical training , mental capacity and ability to stay calm under pressure means they can handle the situations pretty well . \nThey can be a good stabilizing force , and fill the power vaccum in countries where civilian leaders can not take responsibility . \nBut overdoing the role of military is equally bad . \nOnly a balanced approach should work . \nGuys please cut the crap and come back to a good debate , exchange views , ideas , share links etc. do some good . \nWe were getting worried about your safety when you went silent for a long time . \n-LRB- I am sincere in saying this -- this is not sarcasm . -RRB- \nThe author is talking about the role of military in terms of policy making , and policy application . \nIn my opinion , the relationship beetween the Af-Pak situation , and the Libyan can not be made . \nThe US already knows about Pakistan and vice versa . \nBoth actors have fundamental differences over their objectives in Af . \nContrary to what the author claims , the US military does not dominate US foreign policy . \nThe military might be very efficient implementing the policy . \nThere is only one country where the military has played a big role in foreign policy : Pakistan . \nThis is because historically the military has been in charge , and the civilian framework has failed to progress accordingly . \nThe topic of this article is quite interesting . \nOn same lines a financial analysis thrown up would be that role of military is directly proportional to the of budget spent on defence\\/war\\/military . \nThe magical number is somehow around 10 % . \nAs soon as any country 's defense budget % croses 10 % or so then only 3 paths are pursued -- 1 . \nmilitary rule or 2 . \ndivision of teritorry or 3 . \nPakistan has experienced the first two and afghanistan and middle-east are experiencing the last one . \nBut on other hand if defense budgets go down below 3-5 % then such countries expose themselves to risk of being bullied\\/annexed by more powerful nations . \nSo I would agree with Umair is that a balance is needed . \nBut where I disagree with Umair is that military can not produce good leaders simply because in starting all looks good with military dominance but as things progress the real face is seen . \nLets be very clear that military men -LRB- irrespective of country , caste , religion , culture , creed , etc -RRB- are trained killers and killers should NEVER be allowed to run countries and decide fates of millions and billions . \nAnd we all can see what happens when military dominance is high in countries like Pakistan , Mynammar , Afghanistan , Libya , Iraq , Yemen , Yugosalavia , etc. . \nOn other hand are countries like India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Indonesia , Turkey , Germany , France , etc where military plays a supporting role to governments and DOES NOT guide the policies of government . \n-LRB- I have deliberately not included US in either of the lists -RRB- The difference is quite visible . \nSo balance is the key . \nMilitary 's role is to assist and not rule . \nThe biggest drawback of military rulers is that they are , by training , not capable of flexibility in dealing with delicate situations involving civilians and local politics . \nWhen dealing with civilian counterparts and citizens , there has to be the capacity to make compromises and sometimes even let go of one 's stand in the interest of harmony . \nThe military mind is trained to seeing things and black and white , there can be no shades of gray when involved . \nAnd rightly so for their professional responsibilty which is combat . \nThis effectively rules them out as being able able and long term administrators of civilian affairs . \nTo my mind the biggest blunder the US committed in Iraq was to let the Pentagon take charge of affairs there after Saddam 's fall . \nHad the State Department , instead of the Defense Department been in charge of day to day administration , quite likely there would have been a more peaceful and perhaps also a faster transition . \nIn many African countries , the Middle East and all the way up to NW Pakistan , tribal societies exist . \nTribes have very strong influence on their members and tribal rivalries are deep and go back over many centuries . \nThis is how they have evolved over generations . \nIn such societies , tribal chiefs -LRB- who are not elected -RRB- play a significant role . \nThey spend their time negotiating deals with other tribes and settling scores . \nIt is very similar to the caste system in India . \nLoyalty to one 's tribal group is much stronger than anything else . \nSo when a nation is formed , usually one tribe dominates the others . \nWhen colonial powers came in , they played the tribes against each other and made gains . \nIn Libya Ghaddaffi 's tribe dominates others . \nHe worked on weakening the tribes on the Eastern part of his country . \nTypically tribal leaders fill up military ranks with their people . \nIf there are rich resources like oil , the tribal members get first preference in all the money . \nThis helps them dominate others . \nThat is what has happened in Libya . \nWhat one sees there is not really a people 's revolution like one saw in Egypt . \nIt is a large scale tribal conflict in which the tribes in the East have managed to wriggle themselves out . \nMilitary defectors belong to tribes that are different from Ghaddaffi 's . \nSo Ghaddaffi is running the show with military members loyal to him -LRB- mostly his tribesmen -RRB- and the money he has accumulated . \nLibya can go the way of post Soviet era Afghanistan if Ghaddaffi is removed . \nTribes will try to regain what they lost and balance each other out . \nI heard on the radio that the military structure in Libya is built along tribal lines . \nGhadaffi did try to diffuse this tribal loyalty , but seems to have failed . \nHe himself is relying on it for his survival now . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia it was a very different phenomenon . \nLibya may not go the way the other two did . \nGlad to see you & thanks for bringing the discussion back on track . \nI agree with you that a country 's army can play a crucial role to fill in the power vaccum during transitional periods -LRB- like currently in Egypt -RRB- . \nBut Pakistan has had a functional & legitimate democracy since it 's creation , despite the flaws faced by all democracies in developing countries -LRB- India , Bangladesh , Turkey etc -RRB- . \nThe problem in case of Pakistan , is that the army is allowed to ovver-ride the civilian govt on many issues , including foreign policy & defense spending & this undermines democracy . \nUltimately , it 's the pakistani poeple who should decide -LRB- through elected representatives -RRB- about ALL major issues concerning the country & the military should take orders from the civilian govt instead of the other way around . \nI know that democracy can be very frustrating but have some patience . \nMore than 90 % of India 's elected officials are also corrupt & inept clowns but there have been some good ones ' as well & it 's finally paying off . \nAll foreigners will be treated as trespassers and would be shot on sight or taken as hostages and would be set free against a fixed amount to be paid in cash , kaldar not Afghan currency . \nAfghan currency is for non Pashtoons who happen to be living in Afghanistan but have never proven to be loyal . \nThis is a country of beautiful orchards and valleys where most warriors of the world have found a last resting place . \nThose who were braver than the Pashtoons went back to their home countries in Greece , Turkey , England , Scotland , Moscow , Petersbarg and the last one virginia , texas , and some to new york , and lastly not to forget some to European countris . \nThe show is coming soon to close , the American military and its leaders have learned their lessons , never to engage again their military in a muslim land . \nAny one who would suggest to the USA President to do so needs to have his head examined , says Robert Gates . \nThe American power has had enough of the adventures ! \nNow what was the discussion about India engaging with Afghanistan ? \nThs is something they love most , people from the past who worship statues and do not believe in God . \nHad they known this in advance they wuld not have destroyed their Gods in Bhamian ? \nWhat India can do is to provide some of the millions of its slaves -LRB- Indian labor Minister calls them bonded labor and denies they ae slaves -RRB- to cear up the mess the Americans are going to leave . \n`` >> -RRB- Believe me you , I would unfurl that turban shlowly , shlowly . '' \nPosted by shahidkhan123 Would that be , before or after the stripping of your burka ? \n@Rex minor : As someone , who 's not an Afghan or a Pashtun or even from the region -LRB- as you claim -RRB- , you sure have a lot of authority to speak for the Afghan people . -RRB- \nMore than 90 % of India s elected officials are also corrupt & inept clowns but there have been some good ones as well & it s finally paying off . -RRB- \nI have to disagree here . \nA professional army s job is to protect the country , deter the enemy , retrieve stolen land not run cricket boards . \nGood to see some dissent on the role of the military from another Paistani . \nI was beginning to think all Pakistanis were uncritical worshippers of the army . \nIronically , Umair , it is on account of such dissenting opinions that I would agree with you that there is still hope for Pakistan . \nBut to your point Shahid , in most other jobs , if someone repeatedly fails to perform an assigned task , they are usually sacked . \nSince the Pakistan army has n't managed to `` retrieve stolen land '' -LRB- a task you believe they are responsible for -RRB- in 63 years in spite of various failed attempts , and has in fact lost a significant amount of land in the east thanks to its own genocidal actions , what do you think needs to be done with it ? \n-LRB- I suggest a change of job description to something more realistic and achievable . -RRB- \n`` Considering the recent scandals , perhaps paying off is the right term after all '' Good one , Ganesh . \nBad choice of words by me . \nThe lack of accountability , of those in power , is astonishing & frustrating at the same time . \nI ca n't wait for the day when such scumbags will be hanged for ripping off a country where hundreds of millions live without the most basic of amenities . \n`` give me some insider s information '' I 'm afraid , you 're completely on your own on that one ! \nThanks for concern , though i have been busy at work lately , but spring time has arrived and weather is good in Islamabad . \nAs for the military 's role in Pakistan , since civilian democracy is infant . \nI always argue , democracy under the watchful eyes of the Army is the only option for Pakistan for now . \nI have yet to see a more patriotic institution in Pakistan than the Pakistan Army . \nIt has given its sweat and blood for the country and earned its respect . \nFor any of its shortcomings , i will choose the army over democracy any day . \nBut the good thing is , the Army in Pakistan now fully supports democracy . \nTake care everyone . -RRB- \nOne thing I don t like about democracy in pakistan is people voting along ethnic or party lines . \nwhy not pick the most eligible , honest person ? \nFor this , we can only blame ourselves . \nthe other thing i don t like is our political parties are like family property , they get passed down through generations . \nI only have to replace two words here -LRB- Pakistan and ethnic -RRB- to form another completely true paragraph : One thing I don t like about democracy in India is people voting along caste or party lines . \nwhy not pick the most eligible , honest person ? \nFor this , we can only blame ourselves . \nthe other thing i don t like is our political parties are like family property , they get passed down through generations . \nYou have a limited perception of democracy in Pakistan ! \nPakistan Democracy has time and again faled to give dignity to the people of Pakistan . \nPakistan military were more sensitive to dignity , but also failed after taking the civilian Govt . \ntask of administeration and development of the Nation . \nToday Pakistan is no different than it was half a century before and the state of limbo has dragged on . \nIndia is its enemy No. 1 , with full diplomatic relations , and the the Americans are there to help maintain the military and provide weaponry , but in real time Pakistan military has never admitted defeat at the hands of Indian miliary , though unconditional surrender is a historical document , no different from the surrender of the Third Reich . \nShame on today 's Generals who are visiting Washington and calling on Colin Powel who threatend Musharaf Din the stone age . \nThe General of Ayub 's calibre , who was the first to remove the civilian head and took over the reins of the Govt . \ncould never have stooped down so low that today 's Pakistan has even lost the meaning of the word ` DIGNITY ' . \nNor would the military continue to support clandastine operations against India and the Pashtoon Nation , almost half of them live in todays Pakistan and the other half in Afghanistan . \ntoday is as unpopular in Afghanistan as it used to be in sixties ! \nWhat Pakistan needs is the direct democracy for the people , so that legislations are made with people 's participation and not military participation . \nPakistan military should be confined to barracks outside the cities . \nThat Pakistan future still hangs in the middle of Sardari and sharif Bros on one side and the military on the other side which is equivalent to a permanent Babylonian prison . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNow based in London . \n"}

'' \nWhatever the truth , the killing deepens concerns among the rebels ' Western backers , keen to see them prevail in a five-month-old civil war but frustrated by their lack of unity and nervous about the influence of Islamists . \nThe United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , called for solidarity . \n`` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington . \nRebels who rose up against Gaddafi in February have seized swathes of the country but remain poorly equipped and are still far from ousting him , despite support from NATO airstrikes . \nRebels said on Saturday they had encircled Gaddafi 's last stronghold in the Western Mountains and hoped to seize it soon . \nRebel tanks fired at Tiji , where some 500 government troops are stationed . \n`` We have Tiji surrounded and we hope to take it by the end of the day , '' rebel commander Nasir al-Hamdi , a former police colonel , told Reuters as gunfire crackled in the distance . \nRebels also made a new push on the front just west of the rebel-held city of Misrata . \nHospital sources said 12 rebels were killed and 60 wounded in fighting that rebels said took them to the edge of Zlitan , the largest city between Misrata and the capital Tripoli to the west . \n`` Most of the casualties today were from GRAD missiles and mortar fire . \nWe have advanced well and God willing we will be in Zlitan soon , '' said Ibrhaim Buwathi , 24 . \nNATO strikes also continued in western Libya overnight . \nNATO said early on Saturday it had bombed three satellite dishes in Tripoli to stop `` terror broadcasts '' by Gaddafi , but Libyan state TV remained on air and condemned what it said was the targeting of journalists . \nAs Libya 's civil war grinds on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising summer temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month . \n`` Ramadan will be very tough for us . \nWe 're already struggling now . \nThe weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains . \nIn the east , confusion reigned over who had killed Younes . \nRebel fighters said members of the February 17 Martyrs ' Brigade , a rebel group that is part of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , had collected Younes from the frontline near Brega on Thursday . \nHowever , Tarhouni , the rebel minister , said it was another militia , the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade , who had killed Younes . \nLocals said the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade mainly comprised former prisoners of Gaddafi 's notorious Abu Salim prison in the capital Tripoli , who had always distrusted Younes . \nObaid Ibn Jarrah Brigade was not a member of the Union , which is employed by the Transitional National Council for security . \nNamed after one of the companions of Islam 's Prophet Mohammad , the group is likely to have Islamist leanings . \nOne rebel commander , who asked not to be named , said Islamists whom Younes had targeted as interior minister may have killed him in retaliation . \n`` Some of those Islamists are now fighting with the rebels and they have always refused to fight under Younes 's command and have always viewed him with suspicion , '' he said . \n`` I do n't think the investigation will lead anywhere . \nThey do n't dare to touch the Islamists . '' \nFurther complicating an already murky situation , some Libyans said they feared that Younes ' death would trigger a bloody tribal feud . \nBut in an apparent effort to calm nerves , a rebel source said Younes could be replaced by Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi , a member of the same tribe . \nThe longer the war drags on , the further eastern Libya appears to slip into lawlessness , raising questions about what kind of Libya could emerge if Gaddafi goes . \nTarhouni told reporters on Friday night a gang had attacked a prison using rocket-propelled grenades , helping about 300 former Gaddafi soldiers and loyalists to escape . \n"}

\nABIDJAN\\/DAKAR | Tue Mar 1 , 2011 5:29 pm IST ABIDJAN\\/DAKAR -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ivory Coast 's post-poll crisis is degenerating into armed conflict , with gun battles between forces loyal to presidential rivals erupting in the commercial capital Abidjan and the volatile west of the country . \nIncumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo has defied international pressure to step down after U.N. certified poll results showed he lost an election that was meant to end years of stalemate following a 2002-3 civil war . \nHis rival Alassane Ouattara is internationally recognized as president-elect of Ivory Coast but remains trapped in a lagoon-side hotel under siege by the pro-Gbagbo military , but forces siding with him have succeeded in seizing a town in the west and large swathes of an Abidjan neighborhood . \nHere are some possible scenarios in the weeks ahead : THE RETURN TO ALL-OUT WAR With daily AK-47 assault rifles and heavy weapons fire booming through Abidjan , and clashes erupting in various places across the country this week , a return to all out civil war is looking increasingly likely . \nGbagbo still retains the public loyalty of the armed forces but , fearing a coup , is believed to have ensured that only his core elite forces have adequate access to the army 's weapons . \nU.N. accusations that Gbagbo has been seeking attack helicopters from Belarus further support fears of war . \nBoth Belarus and Gbagbo 's government have denied the accusations . \nIt is not clear whether Ouattara is ready to sanction a full-blown rebel advance , as it would taint his credibility if he came to power . \nNor is it clear the rebels would succeed if they mounted any such offensive . \nBut analysts say Gbagbo 's forces may be spread thin if clashes are opened up on enough fronts and he risks defections if losses within his ranks start building up -- as they seemed to do this week , with a number of deadly ambushes in Abidjan . \nA military source says increasing numbers of soldiers in the Ivorian military are deserting , by switching their phones off and going into hiding . \nA few are defecting to the other side . \nAn unknown factor remains foreign mercenaries and Ivorian militia fighters that analysts say Gbagbo has on his payroll , although he needs money to pay them at a time when the financial noose is closing around him from sanctions and bank closures . \nA STALEMATE OF SPORADIC CLASHES Ivory Coast 's crises have a habit of fizzling into a slow burn neither war nor peace stalemate -- as has been the case since 2002-3 . \nIn this scenario , no side makes much progress and the frontline does n't move much from the existing north-south one , with armed men on each side looting what they can from a rapidly shrinking economy . \nBut previous such stalemates were possible because negotiations held out the hope of a resolution eventually . \nThat now seems impossible since Gbagbo effectively tore up the peace process by refusing to accept the poll results . \nIn this scenario , there would be a high likelihood of civilian unrest . \nThis week saw pro-Gbagbo mobs attack Ouattara supporters and U.N. peacekeepers , after a call by Gbagbo 's youth leader to set up roadblocks and block their movements . \nAU PROPOSES A WAY OUT African presidents tasked with resolving the Ivorian crisis by proposing a `` binding solution '' have been given another month to complete what appears to be a Herculean task . \nDivisions emerged within the panel during their working visit to Abidjan , with Burkina Faso 's president and the head of ECOWAS objecting to the AU continuing with its trip despite threats against them by pro-Gbagbo supporters . \nBoth sides have dug in so deep it is unclear what the AU might propose that would be palatable to both . \nAn outside chance is talk that the AU could propose scrapping the Nov. 28 poll and holding a new one , potentially even with both Gbagbo and Ouattara ruled out and an outside force like Nigeria filling the security vacuum . \nThis is unlikely to be popular in either camp but could be seen as the only way to break the deadlock . \nGBAGBO BOWS TO DEMANDS AND LEAVES Analysts see this as extremely unlikely unless his own life is in danger . \nGbagbo has shown that he is more than willing to watch his country implode economically and head back to all out civil war if it will keep him in power . \nHe has brushed off Western economic sanctions , bank closures and threats of force by West African regional bloc ECOWAS . \nHe has also snubbed offers of a potentially lucrative soft landing in exile in the United States or South Africa . \nThe killings of dozens of Ouattara supporters by pro-Gbagbo forces or allied militias in past weeks also create a strong disincentive for him to leave voluntarily , fearing reprisals or being tried for war crimes in the International Criminal Court . \nHowever , if the insurgency that is raging in Abidjan could attract enough army defectors to reach the gates of Gbagbo 's house , that might be more persuasive . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected

'' \nHe added : `` We 're currently waiting for Tripoli to free itself , and we will give them time to have this honor . '' \nZwei declined to give a figure for the number of troops who had defected but said all forces were under the aegis of a newly formed military council encompassing all rebel-held areas . \n`` In Ajdabiya , we have more than 10,000 volunteers , not including official soldiers , '' he said . \nOther military officials have said they needed to train volunteer recruits first before making a push west . \nThe officers and other witnesses reported that an air force plane bombed close to a munitions store near Ajdabiyah on Monday . \nThe aircraft returned to attack the Haniyeh base a second time , striking close to a storage bunker inside the walls , they said . \n`` There was bombing here last night , but nothing was hit , '' said Jumah Sayed , one of the civilians who had volunteered to guard the base . \n`` If one of these bunkers were hit , everything would be destroyed for miles around . '' \nStacked floor to ceiling in bunkers at the site were crates of missiles , rockets , mortar rounds and other munitions of all calibres , orange dust lying thick on the crate lids . \nZwei , whose base was less than a kilometre from Haniyeh , said he was sure the air force pilots were missing their targets deliberately . \n`` We have complete confidence in the Libyan air force not to hit anything that affects their relatives in the east . \nAnd we see it with bombing away from targets . \nThis is proof they have honor , '' he said . \nLast week , two Libyan pilots flew their fighter planes to Malta and defected , rather than attack anti-Gaddafi forces . \nThe United States said on Monday it was moving ships and planes closer to the country and Prime Minister David Cameron has said his government was working on preparation for the declaration of a `` no-fly '' zone to protect the Libyan people . \nVolunteers guarding Haniyeh , some carrying Kalashniknovs and rocket launchers , said they did not know how to use heavy weaponry at the site . \nFew of them appeared to be professional soldiers . \nThe base comprises 35 bunkers . \nThree bunkers were seen by Reuters , as well as an adjoining hangar which a military expert said was packed with thousands of tonnes of munitions . \nMost of it appeared in good order , although many boxes had a manufacture date from the 1970s . \n"}

'' \nThe turmoil in Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington had to use its diplomatic and defense assets as well as development aid to `` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending . \nClinton spoke a day after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , steeping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power . \nThe U.S. Agency for International Development is sending two humanitarian teams to the region to help provide food and medicine to Libyans fleeing into Tunisia and Egypt . \n`` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said . \nClinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gadaffi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41-year rule . \nClinton was invited to testify to the House panel in defense of President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request for the State Department and the USAID . \nThat is up 1 percent from 2010 levels . \nClinton called it a `` lean budget for lean times . '' \nRepublicans , who took control of the House in November elections , have called for a tough new look at non-military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit . \nClinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries . \nRetreating from international responsibilities often imposed long-term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States `` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home . \n`` We saved money in the short term . \nBut those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , 10 years later , in money and lives , '' she said . \nObama has proposed spending almost $ 110 billion in 2012 on Afghanistan , where he has pledged to begin withdrawing the first of about 100,000 U.S. troops fighting Taliban insurgents by the middle of this year . \nOf this amount , about $ 107 billion is military spending . \nThe State Department , mounting its own civilian `` surge '' aimed at stabilizing Afghanistan , would spend an extra $ 2.2 billion there as it seeks to increase assistance programs . \n`` Retreating from our civilian surge in Afghanistan -- with our troops still in the field -- would be a grave mistake , '' Clinton said . \nShe said U.S. aid to Pakistan was `` equally important . '' \nObama proposes maintaining significant aid to Pakistan to arm , train and equip its military to fight extremists with about $ 1.1 billion earmarked for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund , roughly the same level as last year . \nThe Obama administration is launching its requests for the 2012 budget at a time when spending for 2011 is still not approved by Congress . \nClinton said the 16 percent cut to the State Department and USAID included in a House-passed spending bill for 2011 last month would be `` devastating to our national security .

STRENGTH ON PAPER : Numbers : 50,000 including 25,000 conscripts . \nMain Battle Tanks - 2,205 , including 180 T-90S and 200 T-62 . \nThe rest are in store . \nArmored personnel carriers - 945 . \nEven before the uprising , Libya 's military strength was seen as having been seriously undermined by sanctions and neglect although Western powers had just began to sell it weapons again . \nMuch of the equipment is seen as poorly maintained or unusable , leaving it hard to estimate genuine numbers . \nAnalysts say Gaddafi tried to emasculate the regular army to avoid the emergence of commanders who might rival his immediate family , relying instead particularly on three loyal `` regime protection '' units often of his own tribe . \nThat leaves him with what most estimate to be some 10-12 ,000 loyal Libyan troops . \nThe most reliable formation is seen to be the 32nd Brigade commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis . \nRepeated reports from witnesses , rights groups and others talk of African mercenaries flown in by Gaddafi to help strengthen his government . \nExact numbers are impossible to obtain . \nIn Libya 's east around the city of Benghazi , regular military forces appear to have either defected to the opposition or melted away . \nCitizens groups also appear to have taken arms . \nBut analysts say the opposition lacks much in the way of command and control or even any form of centralized leadership . \nSo far , opposition units have focused primarily on defending territory and have shown little appetite to advance . \nThat leaves loyalist forces trying to stem protest and perhaps regain lost territory in Libya 's west around Tripoli . \nThe key coastal city of Sirte between Tripoli and Benghazi is still under government control and the east effectively lost . \nBut experts warn the situation remains fluid . \n`` We underestimate the degree of loyalty in the security forces , '' warns Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute . \n`` The defections appear to be patchwork and possibly along tribal lines . \nThe units that matter , such as Khamis 's 32nd Brigade , are holding together . \nNAVY - STRENGTH ON PAPER Submarines - 2 patrol submarines . \nLibya 's two surviving Foxtrot class diesel submarines were delivered by the Soviet Union in the late 1980s , but outside experts have long questioned their reliability . \nAccording to IHS Jane 's , in 2003 one was reported to be in dry dock and one was sea going -- although unlikely to be fully operational . \nIt suggested both might already have been abandoned . \nAIR FORCE - STRENGTH ON PAPER Combat capable aircraft - 374 . \n227 fighter aircraft -- 13-Mirage F1-ED , 94 MiG-25 , 75 MiG-23 and 45 MiG-21 . \nHelicopters - 85 Support helicopters Analysts estimate many of Libya 's fast jets are in fact no longer airworthy . \nGaddafi has so far also lost at least three aircraft in the course of this uprising with two jets defecting to Malta and the crew of a third ejecting over the desert rather than bomb opposition targets as ordered . \nOccasional reports have also spoken of the use of helicopter gunships , fuelling calls for foreign powers to impose a no-fly zone . \nThere are also Air Defense Command forces which possess at least 216 surface-to-air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self propelled missiles . \nAgain , maintenance may be an issue . \nMost analysts believe Libya 's armed forces would not be able to seriously threaten outside air forces attempting to enforce a no-fly zone , saying Gaddafi 's defense capabilities probably lag behind those of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein before the US-led 2003 invasion . \nThe BBC reported a British RAF Hercules transport aircraft evacuating foreign nationals came under small arms fire this week but was not seriously damaged . \nSome suggested the attack might have come from opposition forces who mistook the plane for one of Gaddafi 's aircraft on a bombing raid . \nAccording to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , Libya destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical weapons munitions in early 2004 as part of a rapprochement with the West that also saw it abandon a nuclear program . \nThe OPCW told Reuters Libya did retain some 9.5 tons of deadly mustard gas at a secret desert location but no longer had the capability to deliver it . \nSources : Reuters\\/IISS Military Balance 2010 . \n-LRB- additional reporting by David Cutler -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI pray for those who take a stand and put their lives on the line to free Libya of the despicable despot . \nLibya 's rebels need to find a political leader to crystallize their efforts and be able to form a temporary government . \nThen if invited by the people 's representative the West should support the people of Libya by sending in troops and ending this bloodshed quickly ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nGaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters also attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . \nMisrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel-held east of the country . \nIf rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold . \nLoyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of the leader who has headed the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . \n`` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . \nBut the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control and insurgents at Zawiyah and Misrata said they had repulsed assaults and were now fighting to take back the town of Bin Jawad , west of Ras Lanuf . \nGovernment troops pushed the insurgents out of Bin Jawad which they had captured on Saturday . \nBut the rebels regrouped around Ras Lanuf and moved back to the outskirts of Bin Jawad , a small , dusty town sandwiched between the coastal highway and the Mediterranean Sea , 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . \nOne fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from the government assault on Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . \n`` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . \nRebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . \n`` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . \nThere were one and a half hours of fighting ...

'' \nWhen the rebels returned , a fierce exchange of rockets and mortar bombs ensued just outside Bin Jawad with the army also using heavy artillery . \nBehind rebel lines , hundreds of fighters armed with machine guns and assault rifles waited to advance . \n`` The firing is sustained , there is the thud of shells landing , the whoosh of rockets , puffs of smoke and heavy machine gun fire in the distance , '' a Reuters correspondent there said . \nThe rebels said they had shot down a helicopter on Sunday and Reuters was shown the wreckage of a warplane on Saturday near Ras Lanuf that rebels said they had brought down . \nDoctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . \nA French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . \nBritain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi have now left Libya . \nThe Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured after a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . \n`` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . \nThey could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . \nFor our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said . \nWestern leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . \nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . \n`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . \n`` The flow of money must be cut off .

'' \nNATO said its air strikes against government armor , which have recently increased , would continue as long as Gaddafi targeted civilians . \nA resident of the coastal city of Misrata , which has been under siege for six weeks , told Reuters heavy fighting was under way on the eastern approaches and in the center . \nRebels told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces fired Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . \nEarlier Al Jazeera television quoted a rebel spokesman as saying five people died and 20 were wounded in Misrata , a lone rebel bastion in western Libya . \nZuma did not travel from Tripoli to Benghazi with other AU delegates , to the rebels ' surprise , but issued a statement when he got home saying the mission was `` a huge success '' . \nLibyan officials have repeatedly said that Gaddafi , who holds no official state position , will not quit . \nThe AU delegation was met in Benghazi by up to 3,000 demonstrators holding banners reading : `` African Union take Gaddafi with you '' and `` Gaddafi has committed genocide '' . \nThey pushed up to the doors of the hotel where the talks were held , yelling `` the people want the downfall of the regime '' . \nOfficials from NATO , which is bombing Libyan government armor under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , said they took note of the African Union plan but the alliance would continue operations while civilians were at risk . \nHuman Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . \nIt said about 250 people had died . \nThe African Union does not have a good track record in brokering peace deals , having failed recently to end conflicts or disputes in Somalia , Madagascar and Ivory Coast . \nAt the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . \nBut there were only light skirmishes on Monday on the contested road to the oil port of Brega , 70 kms -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , in contrast to Sunday 's heavy fighting in Ajdabiyah when rebels repelled a government assault . \nNATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor over the weekend , destroying 25 tanks around Misrata and Ajdabiyah after rebels accused them of acting too slowly . \nAn AU statement after the Tripoli talks spoke of a transition but made no mention of Gaddafi 's future . \nAsked if the issue of him stepping aside was discussed , Ramtane Lamamra , AU Commissioner for Peace and Security , told reporters : `` There was some discussion . '' \nHowever he added : `` I can not report on confidential discussions because first of all I was not part of them . '' \nThe AU proposal included an immediate cessation of hostilities , effective monitoring of the ceasefire , the delivery of humanitarian aid and the protection of foreigners . \nIn Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States wanted to see `` the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya '' , but avoided comment on the AU plan . \nThe rebels had previously rejected a negotiated outcome to what has become the bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . \nThe NATO attacks outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . \nThe town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . \nOn Monday upbeat rebels were putting burned and mangled bodies into blankets by blackened government vehicles outside Ajdabiyah and dragging them into the desert for burial . \n`` We have been able to advance because of the air strikes , '' said rebel Belgassim El-Awami . \nIt was not clear how far west the rebels had moved along a front which has swung back and forth for more than a week in a fight for the oil port of Brega . \nOpposition fighters have been overwhelmed by Gaddafi 's firepower in western Libya , close to his base of Tripoli , but are increasingly using guerrilla tactics to weaken his hold . \nTripoli residents said there had been several attacks on army checkpoints and a police station in the last week and gunfire can be heard at night . \n"}

{"id": "345", "time": "2011-08-22", "text": "LONDON | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 3:31 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Investors peering through the receding fog of war will find plenty of promise and a few pitfalls in a post-Gaddafi Libya . \nIf peace takes hold in Africa 's largest oil producer after a six-month civil war , the long-dormant economy could rapidly flourish provided there has been no substantial damage to the oil and gas infrastructure underpinning its national wealth . \nMuch remains undecided as anti-government forces gain control of Tripoli in their final push to end the four-decade rule of Muammar Gaddafi but a new Libyan government could herald a bonanza for Western companies and investors . \n`` Libya is a fantastically wealthy country that does n't need foreign money but foreign expertise . \nThis could be the start of an experiment in hydrocarbon-fueled capitalism with a lot of money up for grabs , '' said Emad Mostaque , Chief Middle East and North Africa strategist at Religare Capital Markets . \nThough less advanced than the rest of North Africa even prior to the civil war , the Libyan economy has ample resources it could marshal for national reconstruction . \nAn estimated $ 150 billion in sovereign assets once controlled by Gaddafi and his inner circle has been frozen abroad by foreign governments and 144 tonnes of gold is held by the Libyan central bank . \nCombine that with a modest population of 6.4 million and standards of education on a par with established emerging economies such as Malaysia and Mexico , and Libya looks well placed for recovery , said Sven Richter , head of frontier markets at Renaissance Asset Managers . \n`` From that point of view , they are in a quite enviable position , '' he said . \nA sovereign wealth fund set up in 2006 to manage Libya 's oil revenues could also prove pivotal if the new government does not purge all personnel associated with Gaddafi . \nThough somewhat depleted , the Libyan Investment Authority still holds billions of dollars in cash and a number of lucrative equity stakes in Western blue-chip companies such as Pearson -LRB- PSON . \nL -RRB- and UniCredit -LRB- CRDI . \nIt could spearhead infrastructure development and make up for some of this year 's slump in foreign direct investments , which according to United Nations data swelled Libya 's coffers by $ 3.8 billion last year . \nInvestment from the fund could also help broaden the Libyan economy away from oil and help attract other sovereign wealth funds and longer term foreign investors . \n`` In the last couple of weeks , there have been increasing questions about the unity of the rebels , especially after the killing of General Abdel Fattah Younes just 12 days ago , '' said Raza Agha , MENA economist at RBS . \nThe death of the rebel military commander after he was taken into custody by his own side for questioning remains unexplained , underscoring the disparate nature of the rebel National Transitional Council as a mix of Gaddafi opponents . \n`` Beyond Gaddafi , there is a lack of any unifying institution or individual . \nIn Egypt and Tunisia , for example , the military was held in high esteem by the population , '' said Agha . \nIf it can hold together , the new government is likely to be friendly toward the West , having come into power supported by NATO air strikes . \nAn official at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO has already said the company may have difficulties working with China , Russia and Brazil which opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi . \nSo Western companies look well positioned as billions of dollars in oil exploration and construction contracts come up for grabs as part of the reconstruction effort . \nReligare 's Mostaque also expects Qatari banks and firms to benefit when Libya reopens its doors to investment . \nQatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to contribute planes to police United Nations-backed no-fly zones over the country . \nUntil fighting broke out in February , Libya was the world 's 12th largest oil exporter though its output was modest , coming in at about 1.6 million barrels a day or 2 percent of global oil output . \nThe disruption of Libyan supply was thus easily compensated by increased Saudi production . \nThe incoming government will likely focus on raising the country 's production capacity with a view to capitalizing on its oil reserves , the ninth largest in the world . \nInvestors also see potential in Libya 's banking and insurance sector , which briefly enjoyed foreign investor interest when decades of Western sanctions were lifted in 2004 . \nFrance 's BNP Paribas -LRB- BNPP . \nPA -RRB- took a minority stake in a local bank when banking rules were eased and Renaissance 's Richter expects foreign interest to revive when stability returns . \n`` Financial services demand will be driven by the oil industry , '' he said . \n"}

{"id": "217", "time": "2011-08-22", "text": "Mon Aug 22 , 2011 9:12 am EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Six months of civil war have left Libya 's oil industry in chaos , with fields that once pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- deserted and export terminals , pumping stations and pipelines damaged by fighting and sabotage . \nBut with opposition fighters now in control of most parts of the capital , Tripoli , and the battle for control of the country probably in its final phase , industry executives and analysts say much of the country 's oil output could be resurrected within months if peace can be established quickly . \nAlthough it will struggle to return to pre-war output for the foreseeable future , output of as much as 1 million bpd could be feasible within months , they say . \nMuch will depend on the damage done to infrastructure and equipment in the last stages of the fighting between forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his 41 years of rule . \nAn official working for Libya 's Arabian Gulf Oil Company -LRB- AGOCO -RRB- , which has been operating the Sarir and Mesla oilfields under rebel control , said on Friday that output from its area could resume within three weeks . \n`` Our fields are under maintenance and we 're still waiting for security , '' Abdeljalil Mayouf , information manager at AGOCO told Reuters . \n`` When the security is OK we will start . \nPerhaps two or three weeks after the improvement in security . \nIn three weeks maybe . '' \nBut even if Gaddafi avoids a bloody finish , his departure could usher in a new period of instability and uncertainty . \nAnalysts , oil companies and Western governments worry that the opposition is riven by internal division , which could prompt new fighting after Gaddafi has been removed from power , jeopardizing both post-war recovery and the resumption of oil exports . \nWar and other traumas in oil producing nations have typically had a lasting impact on output . \nThe speed of recovery in oil output depends crucially on how quickly international companies with highly evolved skills can be brought in . \nFollowing are details of Libya 's oil industry , production and assessments of how long it may take to restore output . \n\\* Until the beginning of this year , OPEC member Libya was the world 's 17th-largest oil producer and Africa 's third-largest . \nIt holds the continent 's largest crude oil reserves . \nIt sold about 85 percent of its exports to Europe . \n\\* Oil production was equivalent to about 2 percent of global consumption , but fighting and social disruption have cut this to less than 100,000 bpd , and exports have stopped altogether . \nMany oilfields are dependent on foreign workers , who have almost all left the country . \n\\* Most of Libya 's oilfields are around the Sirte Basin , which contains around 80 percent of its proven reserves and spans the front line between rebel and government forces . \nMany other key parts of the country 's oil industry are still held by forces loyal to Gaddafi . \n\\* Libya has six major oil export terminals , listed with loading volumes for January from the IEA . \nThe condition of these facilities now is not clear : - Es Sider -LRB- 447,000 bpd -RRB- - Ras Lanuf -LRB- 195,000 bpd -RRB- \\* Damage to infrastructure was reported to be light during the first few months of fighting as both sides hoped to take full control of the country 's oil industry . \nIn March , officials said the terminals of Ras Lanuf , Zueitina and Es Sider had suffered only minor damage during fighting and some other oil towns had been left untouched . \n\\* But damage has increased as fighting has continued and rebels have reported significant damage to oil infrastructure this month . \nIt has not been possible to independently confirm reports of damage being done to oil installations , an accusation rebels have previously leveled at government forces . \n\\* Libya 's oil industry was formerly run by the state National Oil Co , which accounted for around 50 percent of the country 's output . \n\\* Since fighting began , the Libyan National Council , with the help of Qatar has been able to export a minimal amount of crude oil in the form of two partially laden tankers . \nThe oil for these cargoes was reported previously to have been in storage . \nOne of these cargoes went to a U.S. refinery and the other to Italy . \nNo exports have been reported for several weeks . \n\\* It is not clear how the oil industry will be structured after the war , but it may be placed in the hands of AGOCO . \n\\* A Reuters poll of 20 analysts and industry officials last month forecast it would take up to one year to restore Libyan output to at least 1 million bpd but up to two years to get back to pre-civil war levels of 1.6 million bpd . \n\\* The longest forecast for a full recovery of oil output came from David Wech , head of research at Vienna-based consultants JBC Energy . \nHe said a return to full output capacity could take three to four years because significant investment in infrastructure would be necessary . \n\\* Oil industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said it would take around 36 months for the country to recover its full production capacity , from whenever the crisis is resolved . \nIt estimates that substantial oil volumes could be back in the market by late 2012 if a resolution is achieved by the end of 2011 . \nBut the recovery period will extend if production remains shut-in for longer , as infrastructure continues to deteriorate . \n\\* Samuel Ciszuk , senior Middle East & North Africa energy analyst with IHS Energy , said oil output could theoretically be restored in 18 months but that this would be the most optimistic scenario . \n\\* `` Once there is a degree of security for their personnel , it should not take too long for the oil firms to get their workers back in . \nIf the money 's right they will go back , '' said Mike Wittner , Societe Generale head of oil market research in New York . \nBut it was difficult to assess how much damage had been done to oil facilities during the war , he said . \n`` No one really has a clear idea of how much damage to the oil infrastructure there has been ... Anytime you shut a field down quickly and run off in a panic there will be problems . '' \n\\* Foreign oil firms , essential for the quick resumption of production , have spoken to rebels at length , but the future of existing contracts with Gaddafi 's government is uncertain . \n\\* Italian producer ENI , present in Libya since the 1950s , is the biggest foreign oil company there , producing 270,000 boed -LRB- barrels of oil equivalent per day -RRB- in 2010 . \nIts contracts are in force to 2042 for oil production , but it is not yet clear if they would be honored by any future government . \n\\* The total equity share of the following foreign companies -- many of which operated fields on behalf of Libya 's National Oil Co -- amounted to almost 500,000 bpd before the conflict began . \nThe legal status of contracts after the civil war will need to be clarified . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe local work force is either unwilling , untrained , or just plain lazy to perform operations at the refineries . \nThis sadly is the underlying motives NATO and USA , Inc. have for regime change in Libya . \nIf it were not for the petroleum reserves and the opportunity for controlling them , I seriously doubt if NATO would have ever stepped in to help . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "332", "time": "2011-08-22", "text": "The opinions expressed are his own . \nThe Libyan Revolution has largely succeeded , and this is a moment of celebration , not only for Libyans but for a youth generation in the Arab world that has pursued a political opening across the region . \nThe secret of the uprising s final days of success lay in a popular revolt in the working-class districts of the capital , which did most of the hard work of throwing off the rule of secret police and military cliques . \nIt succeeded so well that when revolutionary brigades entered the city from the west , many encountered little or no resistance , and they walked right into the center of the capital . \nMuammar Qaddafi was in hiding as I went to press , and three of his sons were in custody . \nSaif al-Islam Qaddafi had apparently been the de facto ruler of the country in recent years , so his capture signaled a checkmate . \n-LRB- Checkmate is a corruption of the Persian shah maat , the king is confounded , since chess came west from India via Iran -RRB- . \nThe end game , wherein the people of Tripoli overthrew the Qaddafis and joined the opposition Transitional National Council , is the best case scenario that I had suggested was the most likely denouement for the revolution . \nI have been making this argument for some time , and it evoked a certain amount of incredulity when I said it in a lecture in the Netherlands in mid-June , but it has all along been my best guess that things would end the way they have . \nI got it right where others did not because my premises turned out to be sounder , i.e. , that Qaddafi had lost popular support across the board and was in power only through main force . \nOnce enough of his heavy weapons capability was disrupted , and his fuel and ammunition supplies blocked , the underlying hostility of the common people to the regime could again manifest itself , as it had in February . \nI was moreover convinced that the generality of Libyans were attracted by the revolution and by the idea of a political opening , and that there was no great danger to national unity here . \nI do not mean to underestimate the challenges that still lie ahead mopping up operations against regime loyalists , reestablishing law and order in cities that have seen popular revolutions , reconstituting police and the national army , moving the Transitional National Council to Tripoli , founding political parties , and building a new , parliamentary regime . \nEven in much more institutionalized and less clan-based societies such as Tunisia and Egypt , these tasks have proved anything but easy . \nBut it would be wrong , in this moment of triumph for the Libyan Second Republic , to dwell on the difficulties to come . \nLibyans deserve a moment of exultation . \nI have taken a lot of heat for my support of the revolution and of the United Nations-authorized intervention by the Arab League and NATO that kept it from being crushed . \nI haven t taken nearly as much heat as the youth of Misrata who fought off Qaddafi s tank barrages , though , so it is OK . \nI hate war , having actually lived through one in Lebanon , and I hate the idea of people being killed . \nMy critics who imagined me thrilling at NATO bombing raids were just being cruel . \nBut here I agree with President Obama and his citation of Reinhold Niebuhr . \nYou can t protect all victims of mass murder everywhere all the time . \nBut where you can do some good , you should do it , even if you can not do all good . \nI mourn the deaths of all the people who died in this revolution , especially since many of the Qaddafi brigades were clearly coerced -LRB- they deserted in large numbers as soon as they felt it safe -RRB- . \nBut it was clear to me that Qaddafi was not a man to compromise , and that his military machine would mow down the revolutionaries if it were allowed to . \nMoreover , those who question whether there were US interests in Libya seem to me a little blind . \nThe US has an interest in there not being massacres of people for merely exercising their right to free assembly . \nThe US has an interest in a lawful world order , and therefore in the United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that Libyans be protected from their murderous government . \nThe US has an interest in its NATO alliance , and NATO allies France and Britain felt strongly about this intervention . \nThe US has a deep interest in the fate of Egypt , and what happened in Libya would have affected Egypt -LRB- Qaddafi allegedly had high Egyptian officials on his payroll -RRB- . \nGiven the controversies about the revolution , it is worthwhile reviewing the myths about the Libyan Revolution that led so many observers to make so many fantastic or just mistaken assertions about it . \nQaddafi was a progressive in his domestic policies . \nWhile back in the 1970s , Qaddafi was probably more generous in sharing around the oil wealth with the population , buying tractors for farmers , etc. , in the past couple of decades that policy changed . \nHe became vindictive against tribes in the east and in the southwest that had crossed him politically , depriving them of their fair share in the country s resources . \nAnd in the past decade and a half , extreme corruption and the rise of post-Soviet-style oligarchs , including Qaddafi and his sons , have discouraged investment and blighted the economy . \nWorkers were strictly controlled and unable to collectively bargain for improvements in their conditions . \nThere was much more poverty and poor infrastructure in Libya than there should have been in an oil state . \nQaddafi was a progressive in his foreign policy . \nAgain , he traded for decades on positions , or postures , he took in the 1970s . \nIn contrast , in recent years he played a sinister role in Africa , bankrolling brutal dictators and helping foment ruinous wars . \nIn 1996 the supposed champion of the Palestinian cause expelled 30,000 stateless Palestinians from the country . \nAfter he came in from the cold , ending European and US sanctions , he began buddying around with George W. Bush , Silvio Berlusconi and other right wing figures . \nBerlusconi has even said that he considered resigning as Italian prime minister once NATO began its intervention , given his close personal relationship to Qaddafi . \nIt was only natural that Qaddafi sent his military against the protesters and revolutionaries ; any country would have done the same . \nNo , it wouldn t , and this is the argument of a moral cretin . \nIn fact , the Tunisian officer corps refused to fire on Tunisian crowds for dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , and the Egyptian officer corps refused to fire on Egyptian crowds for Hosni Mubarak . \nThe willingness of the Libyan officer corps to visit macabre violence on protesting crowds derived from the centrality of the Qaddafi sons and cronies at the top of the military hierarchy and from the lack of connection between the people and the professional soldiers and mercenaries . \nDeploying the military against non-combatants was a war crime , and doing so in a widespread and systematic way was a crime against humanity . \nQaddafi and his sons will be tried for this crime , which is not perfectly natural . \nThere was a long stalemate in the fighting between the revolutionaries and the Qaddafi military . \nThis idea was fostered by the vantage point of many Western observers , in Benghazi . \nIt is true that there was a long stalemate at Brega , which ended yesterday when the pro-Qaddafi troops there surrendered . \nBut the two most active fronts in the war were Misrata and its environs , and the Western Mountain region . \nMisrata fought an epic , Stalingrad-style , struggle of self-defense against attacking Qaddafi armor and troops , finally proving victorious with NATO help , and then they gradually fought to the west toward Tripoli . \nThe most dramatic battles and advances were in the largely Berber Western Mountain region , where , again , Qaddafi armored units relentlessly shelled small towns and villages but were fought off -LRB- with less help from NATO initially , which I think did not recognize the importance of this theater -RRB- . \nIt was the revolutionary volunteers from this region who eventually took Zawiya , with the help of the people of Zawiya , last Friday and who thereby cut Tripoli off from fuel and ammunition coming from Tunisia and made the fall of the capital possible . \nAny close observer of the war since April has seen constant movement , first at Misrata and then in the Western Mountains , and there was never an over-all stalemate . \nThe Libyan Revolution was a civil war . \nIt was not , if by that is meant a fight between two big groups within the body politic . \nThere was nothing like the vicious sectarian civilian-on-civilian fighting in Baghdad in 2006 . \nThe revolution began as peaceful public protests , and only when the urban crowds were subjected to artillery , tank , mortar and cluster bomb barrages did the revolutionaries begin arming themselves . \nWhen fighting began , it was volunteer combatants representing their city quarters taking on trained regular army troops and mercenaries . \nThat is a revolution , not a civil war . \nOnly in a few small pockets of territory , such as Sirte and its environs , did pro-Qaddafi civilians oppose the revolutionaries , but it would be wrong to magnify a handful of skirmishes of that sort into a civil war . \nQaddafi s support was too limited , too thin , and too centered in the professional military , to allow us to speak of a civil war . \nLibya is not a real country and could have been partitioned between east and west . \nIt requites no great prescience to see that this will all end up badly . \nQaddafi s failure to collapse on schedule is prompting increasing pressure to start a ground war , since the NATO operation is , in terms of prestige , like the banks Obama has bailed out , Too Big to Fail . \nLibya will probably be balkanized . \nI don t understand the propensity of Western analysts to keep pronouncing nations in the global south artificial and on the verge of splitting up . \nIt is a kind of Orientalism . \nAll nations are artificial . \nBenedict Anderson dates the nation-state to the late 1700s , and even if it were a bit earlier , it is a new thing in history . \nMoreover , most nation-states are multi-ethnic , and many long-established ones have sub-nationalisms that threaten their unity . \nThus , the Catalans and Basque are uneasy inside Spain , the Scottish may bolt Britain any moment , etc. , etc. . \nIn contrast , Libya does not have any well-organized , popular separatist movements . \nIt does have tribal divisions , but these are not the basis for nationalist separatism , and tribal alliances and fissures are more fluid than ethnicity -LRB- which is itself less fixed than people assume -RRB- . \nEveryone speaks Arabic , though for Berbers it is the public language ; Berbers were among the central Libyan heroes of the revolution , and will be rewarded with a more pluralist Libya . \nThis generation of young Libyans , who waged the revolution , have mostly been through state schools and have a strong allegiance to the idea of Libya . \nThroughout the revolution , the people of Benghazi insisted that Tripoli was and would remain the capital . \nWesterners looking for break-ups after dictatorships are fixated on the Balkan events after 1989 , but there most often isn t an exact analog to those in the contemporary Arab world . \nThere had to be NATO infantry brigades on the ground for the revolution to succeed . \nEveryone from Cockburn to Max Boot -LRB- scary when those two agree -RRB- put forward this idea . \nBut there are not any foreign infantry brigades in Libya , and there are unlikely to be any . \nLibyans are very nationalistic and they made this clear from the beginning . \nLikewise the Arab League . \nNATO had some intelligence assets on the ground , but they were small in number , were requested behind the scenes for liaison and spotting by the revolutionaries , and did not amount to an invasion force . \nThe Libyan people never needed foreign ground brigades to succeed in their revolution . \nThe United States led the charge to war . \nThere is no evidence for this allegation whatsoever . \nWhen I asked Glenn Greenwald whether a US refusal to join France and Britain in a NATO united front might not have destroyed NATO , he replied that NATO would never have gone forward unless the US had plumped for the intervention in the first place . \nI fear that answer was less fact-based and more doctrinaire than we are accustomed to hearing from Mr. Greenwald , whose research and analysis on domestic issues is generally first-rate . \nAs someone not a stranger to diplomatic history , and who has actually heard briefings in Europe from foreign ministries and officers of NATO members , I m offended at the glibness of an answer given with no more substantiation than an idee fixe . \nThe excellent McClatchy wire service reported on the reasons for which then Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , the Pentagon , and Obama himself were extremely reluctant to become involved in yet another war in the Muslim world . \nIt is obvious that the French and the British led the charge on this intervention , likely because they believed that a protracted struggle over years between the opposition and Qaddafi in Libya would radicalize it and give an opening to al-Qaeda and so pose various threats to Europe . \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy had been politically mauled , as well , by the offer of his defense minister , Mich le Alliot-Marie , to send French troops to assist Ben Ali in Tunisia -LRB- Alliot-Marie had been Ben Ali s guest on fancy vacations -RRB- , and may have wanted to restore traditional French cachet in the Arab world as well as to look decisive to his electorate . \nWhatever Western Europe s motivations , they were the decisive ones , and the Obama administration clearly came along as a junior partner -LRB- something Sen. John McCain is complaining bitterly about -RRB- . \nQaddafi would not have killed or imprisoned large numbers of dissidents in Benghazi , Derna , al-Bayda and Tobruk if he had been allowed to pursue his March Blitzkrieg toward the eastern cities that had defied him . \nBut we have real-world examples of how he would have behaved , in Zawiya , Tawargha , Misrata and elsewhere . \nHis indiscriminate shelling of Misrata had already killed between 1000 and 2000 by last April , , and it continued all summer . \nAt least one Qaddafi mass grave with 150 bodies in it has been discovered . \nAnd the full story of the horrors in Zawiya and elsewhere in the west has yet to emerge , but it will not be pretty . \nThe opposition claims Qaddafi s forces killed tens of thousands . \nPublic health studies may eventually settle this issue , but we know definitively what Qaddafi was capable of . \nThis was a war for Libya s oil . \nLibya was already integrated into the international oil markets , and had done billions of deals with BP , ENI , etc. , etc. . \nNone of those companies would have wanted to endanger their contracts by getting rid of the ruler who had signed them . \nThey had often already had the trauma of having to compete for post-war Iraqi contracts , a process in which many did less well than they would have liked . \nENI s profits were hurt by the Libyan revolution , as were those of Total SA . \nMoreover , taking Libyan oil off the market through a NATO military intervention could have been foreseen to put up oil prices , which no Western elected leader would have wanted to see , especially Barack Obama , with the danger that a spike in energy prices could prolong the economic doldrums . \nAn economic argument for imperialism is fine if it makes sense , but this one does not , and there is no good evidence for it -LRB- that Qaddafi was erratic is not enough -RRB- , and is therefore just a conspiracy theory . \nThis piece originally appeared on Professor Cole 's blog , Informed Comment . \nMr Cole , Who do you get paid by to write up stories like that ? \nWhy on Earth would the already bankrupt Western Governments throw a trillion dollars at this war ? \nFor the love of the Libyan people ? \nYou forgot to mention some key issues like the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union by Ghaddafi , which effectively would have put the IMF out of business in Africa . \nIn 2006 Tony Blair was buddy buddy with Ghaddafi and Ghaddafi 's sins were absolved . \nWhy after such short time is he suddenly the evil tyrant again ? \nProtecting civilians by bombarding a country is an insult to intelligence . \nWhat are NATO 's real reasons to fork our a trillion dollars for this project ? \nAt the end of the day there is not any country on earth where disgruntled citizens would not rise up to topple the government -- a little outside influence can whip up some support to mobilize these entities . \nOh , and by all means include Democracies ! \nYugoslavia was exemplary in that respect . \nDictators do not grow on trees ! \nThey are usually armed to the teeth by western powers . \nThere are hundreds of examples of this . \n834.5 m worth of arms to Lybia over a five year period . \nUK , France and Italy being the main exporters profiting from these lucrative deals with Ghaddafi . \nNeedless to say that Ghaddafi needed to give some concessions for these extravagant arm deals , like letting foreign oil companies to participate in exploration , give a piece of the banking system to the IMF etc. . \nBut after 2009 he wisened up and would not budge . \nYou are quoting Reinhold Niehbuhr and Obama , surely the best way to protect civilians is to sell their dictator arms , is n't it ? \nIt is very sensible option , to provide a military dictator of 41 years , top notch weapons , especially to Ghadafi , who allegedly blew up the Pan Am flight , and provided breeding ground for terrorist - the largest number of suicide bombers for Iraq . \nPlease explain how you get at the trillion dollar figure for this conflict ? \nEvery source I check has it in 10 ? \ns of billions tops , that is 2 orders of magnitude difference . \nI agree why did Mr Cole not mention some other key issues like , the creation of the African Central Bank , the gold dinars , the African union . . \nAnd the IMF invovment ... Why leave out these key issues Mr Cole , you are better then that ... So this is an opinion piece , right ? \nHow come is it that mass media outlets never have an opposing opinion piece questioning the legitimacy of the rebels , or the real agenda behind NATO involvement ? \nIt 's all about falling in line and propagating the same bulls \\* it that few informed people are actually buying . \nFor someone who 's lived in `` various parts of the Muslim world for nearly 10 years '' , Juan Cole 's piece reads like a high-schoolers essay with poorly researched arguments and `` the opposition claims '' facts . \nIt 's very discouraging at how disconnected media is from reality and how eager it is to fall in line with NATO foreign policy . \nExcellent article , I am sick and tired of people propagating these myths . \nAlso I highly doubt any sane person is pro-gaddafi , only anti-NATO . \nThis article is ridiculous . \nPlease I ask you all to do your own research ... . \n`` Believe Nothing , No Matter Where You Read It , or Who Said It , No Matter If I Have Said It , Unless It Agrees with Your Own Reason and Your Own Common Sense .

{"id": "243", "time": "2011-08-22", "text": "BEIRUT | Mon Aug 22 , 2011 3:20 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- '' - The downfall of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is likely to pave the way for increased Western attention to Syria and embolden protests against President Bashar al-Assad . \nThe implosion of Gaddafi 's rule after six months of civil war in which the rebels benefited from sanctions on Gaddafi , a no-fly zone and NATO air strikes may have implications for Syri 's six-month-old revolt and Assad 's efforts to crush it . \n`` The international community will now think that its strong intervention in the struggle -LRB- in Syria -RRB- will resolve the situation , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . \n`` Libya has raised the morale of the West and it will have a bigger excuse to intervene . \nBut we reject any military action in Syria . '' \nHussein and other opposition activists said however the events in Tripoli would revive Syrian protesters ' hopes . \n`` What happened in Libya means a lot for us , it means that the Arab spring is coming without doubt ... there is no solution to any problem without the will of the people , '' said Michel Kilo , a prominent opposition figure . \nNo country has proposed the kind of action in Syria which NATO forces have carried out in Libya . \nBut the West has called on Assad to step down and Washington has imposed new sanctions over his crackdown , in which the United Nations says 2,200 civilians have died . \nSyria has an alliance with Iran and a key role in Lebanon , despite ending a 29-year military presence there in 2005 . \nIt also has influence in Iraq and supports militant groups Hamas , Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah . \nAssad on Sunday said Syria would not bow to external pressure , which he said could only affect `` a president made in the United States and a subservient people who get their orders from outside . '' \n`` As for the threat of a military action ... any action against Syria will have greater consequences -LRB- on those who carry it out -RRB- , greater than they can tolerate , '' he said . \nAssad has responded to the unrest with a mixture of reforms and force . \nHe granted citizenship to hundreds of thousands of ethnic Kurds , ended a state of emergency and promised to let groups other than his Baath party run in elections . \nAnalysts and opposition figures said they expected the situation in Syria to deteriorate further , with authorities intensifying the crackdown and protesters not backing down . \n`` After what happened in Libya I think he -LRB- Assad -RRB- will be tougher with the security option he is taking , '' Boumonsef said . \n`` He sees what -LRB- he calls -RRB- the international conspiracy on him will be stronger and now that Gaddafi is out of the way it will move toward him in full strength ... This is imminent . '' \nSome opposition figures expressed fears that Libya 's endgame might encourage voices among the opposition calling for the arming of a hitherto largely peaceful movement in Syria . \n`` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said Hussein , who was detained during the uprising . \n`` But we will resist such proposals , regardless of where they are coming from . '' \nThe anti-Assad movement is fragmented . \n`` Despite everything that is happening , the opposition remains stuck over little issues like personal issues between its leaders , '' Kilo said . \nBoumonsef said it would try harder , with international help , to unify . \n`` The opposition will be motivated more . \nThere is no return and -LRB- Assad 's -RRB- reforms will not stop anything . \nIt is too late . '' \nEncouraged after Western leaders called on Assad to step down , Syrian opposition figures are holding talks in Istanbul to nominate a broad-based council that could aid in a transition of power if Assad is toppled . \nUnlike previous opposition conferences , which were marked by divisions between Islamists and liberals , participants said there was broad agreement on 120 nominees for the council from inside and outside Syria . \nThe council would speak for dissidents in exile and activists on the ground , opposition figures told Reuters . \nBut some poured cold water on the idea . \n`` There is no interest inside Syria in a conference happening outside because the public opinion and those inside Syria believe that what is happening outside is marginal , '' Kilo said . \n`` We do not need a transitional council ... the real challenge is not what should be done after the regime collapses but for us it is what should be done every day so that we remain standing .

{"id": "16", "time": "2011-08-25", "text": "The opinions expressed are his own . \nWith the press focused on scenes of joy in Tripoli and Benghazi , continued skirmishes with regime loyalists , and speculation about where Gaddafi might turn up , it is time to lift our sights and focus on the really difficult transition ahead . \nIf another autocrat succeeds Gaddafi , the transition could be over soon . \nBut if Libya embarks on an effort to create a more democratic state , unified and inclusive in many dimensions , we ll need to wait the better part of a decade to know whether it has succeeded or not . \nThere are no magic formulas for how to go about this . \nEach contingency has its own requirements . \nWe have seen many more partial failures than full successes : think Iraq and Afghanistan . \nCertainly in Libya security will be job one . \nThe immediate goal is public order , so that people can move freely without fear of large-scale violence . \nBut there was public order of a non-democratic sort in Gaddafi s Libya . \nWhat the rebels have done in areas liberated in recent months is as clever as it is remarkable : they have organized local councils to try to ensure security and other immediate requirements . \nThis does not always happen in civil wars but it suggests a way forward . \nThere were at least four councils in Tripoli before Gaddafi fell . \nCan they step in to organize local communities to protect themselves from the inevitable aftershocks of Gaddafi s fall ? \nEven if that works , it is only a temporary expedient . \nLibya will need a retrained and re-oriented police force , one that seeks to serve and protect rather than intimidate and repress . \nInternational assistance in this regard has become the rule rather than the exception , but there is little unused international capacity , because of Afghanistan , Kosovo and other requirements . \nIt is tempting to suggest that Arab countries take on this task , but difficult to imagine that they will do it in a way that encourages the kind of community policing that is needed . \nEven training and retraining 1,000 per year , it will take at least the better part of a decade to put in place a police force Libyan democracy would want . \nEven well-trained police are no use if there are no courts where the people they arrest can be fairly tried and sentenced , as well as prisons to put them in . \nCourts require not only judges but also prosecutors and defense attorneys , not to mention court recorders , registrars and bailiffs . \nIf the formal court system fails to provide fair and rapid justice , Libyans will turn to informal methods of dispute resolution , especially where tribal structures are strong in the countryside . \nThere is nothing inherently wrong with that , but there are difficult issues to be resolved concerning the interaction between tribal and formal justice systems , and the treatment of women in tribal systems . \nThe justice system is an important part of the state , especially in post-war situations , but it is not the only thing that needs fixing . \nLibya has only rudimentary state institutions apart from the oil ministry . \nThere is no constitution . \nAll power lay in the hands of Gaddafi and his family . \nSo there will be a need to build the state almost from the ground up . \nThere may be advantages in this , as there will be less to sweep away . \nThe Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- that has led the rebellion has published a good , relatively liberal and democratic constitutional charter . \nBut the TNC needs to reformulate itself to be more representative of parts of the country that have been liberated only recently , including Tripoli . \nAnd its capability to implement its good intentions is not yet clear . \nThe TNC would like to prepare a new constitution within six months and hold elections within a year to help establish democratic legitimacy . \nThe problem with this idea is that a democratic environment and culture can not be created in such a short time frame , which favors those with an existing organizational infrastructure like Islamists -LRB- who will use the mosques -RRB- and disfavors those with shallower roots in Libyan society , like secularists . \nThis tension is still being played out in Egypt . \nIt might also be wise to consider holding local elections first , since they produce results more immediately reflective of citizens needs and provide a test of both the electoral mechanism and political outcomes . \nBut in the end Libyans will need to decide . \nI will not be surprised if the one-year time frame gets extended to two , and the real outcomes are not apparent until the second elections , presumably four years later . \nAll this requires money . \nLibya s economy is essentially 100 per cent dependent on oil and gas . \nIt will take time to get production back up to pre-war levels . \nIn the meanwhile , the TNC will need access to the frozen assets of the Gaddafi regime . \nThis is not a simple matter . \nIn many countries , including the United States , it requires not only a decision of the president but also a presentation to the sanctions committee of the United Nations . \nThere are ample funds well over $ 30 billion are frozen in the United States alone . \nBut getting them to the TNC , and ensuring that they are spent accountably and transparently will not be easy . \nThere are few well established oil and gas producing states that have managed that trick . \nThe people of Libya in the meanwhile are living in dreadful conditions . \nFood , water , health care and electricity are lacking , especially in vulnerable populations like the poor and displaced . \nThe TNC needs somehow to begin to deliver goods and services , especially in the major cities . \nLibyans will be celebrating for a few days , but then they are going to start to wonder how they are better off . \nThat is a question that will persist even once immediate needs are satisfied . \nTen years from now Libyans will be discussing whether justice has been done to those who committed crimes under the Gaddafi regime , and whether the traumas of that regime and the civil war have been healed . \nAll these decade-long challenges will require an alert and informed Libyan citizenry . \nThe activism and energy that they have shown in resisting the Gaddafi regime needs to be continued and channeled into the development of civil society organizations that can mediate between the citizens and their new state . \nHundreds of such organizations have already emerged in Benghazi and other liberated areas . \nMore will emerge in Tripoli . \nThey are vital to keeping a democratic transition on track . \nThe international role in all of this is still unclear . \nThe United States is trying to limit its burdens . \nIt has too much to do elsewhere and no truly vital national interests at stake in Libya , even if it might have some specific interests in preventing Libya from becoming a source of arms trafficking and a haven for international terrorists . \nEuropean interests are more compelling : oil and gas , related investments , and the desire to prevent migration from Libya becoming an issue in European domestic politics . \nThe Arab League and its members also have an interest in seeing Libya back on its feet as soon as possible . \nThe international community , which so far has based its efforts on UN Security Council resolution 1973 , needs a clear set of goals and a reasonable division of labor to guide it in the future . \nGetting Libya right in the post-war decade is going to require a lot of European and Arab support , and the Americans need to be ready to pitch in where they have unique capabilities . \nPHOTO : A Libyan rebel fighter shouts slogans as his comrades search for snipers in the final push to flush out Muammar Gaddafi 's forces in Abu Slim area in Tripoli August 25 , 2011

{"id": "113", "time": "2011-08-25", "text": "TRIPOLI | Thu Aug 25 , 2011 6:56 pm EDT TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Muammar Gaddafi taunted his Libyan enemies and their Western backers as rebel forces battled pockets of loyalists across Tripoli in an ever more urgent quest to find and silence the fugitive strongman . \nRumors of Gaddafi or his sons being cornered , even sighted , swirled among excitable rebel fighters engaged in heavy machinegun and rocket exchanges . \nBut two days after his compound was overrun , hopes of a swift end to six months of war were still being frustrated by fierce rearguard actions . \nWestern powers demanded Gaddafi 's surrender and worked to release frozen Libyan state funds , hoping to ease hardships and start reconstruction in the oil-rich state . \nBut with loyalists holding out in the capital , in Gaddafi 's coastal home city and deep in the inland desert , violence could go on for some time , testing the ability of the government-in-waiting to keep order . \n`` The tribes ... must march on Tripoli , '' Gaddafi said in an audio message broadcast on a sympathetic TV channel . \n`` Do not leave Tripoli to those rats , kill them , defeat them quickly . \n`` The enemy is delusional , NATO is retreating , '' he shouted , sounding firmer and clearer than in a similar speech released on Wednesday . \nThough his enemies believe Gaddafi , 69 , is still in the capital , they fear he could flee by long-prepared escape routes , using tunnels and bunkers , to rally an insurgency . \nDiehards numbering perhaps in the hundreds were keeping at bay squads of irregular , anti-Gaddafi fighters who had swept into the capital on Sunday and who were now rushing from one site to another , firing assault rifles , machineguns and anti-aircraft cannon bolted to the backs of pick-up trucks . \nIn a southern district close to the notorious prison of Abu Salim , the rebel forces launched a concerted assault , sweeping from house to house and taking prisoners . \nElsewhere , pro-Gaddafi forces shelled rebel positions at Tripoli 's airport , and NATO warplanes bombed Sirte to the east -- Gaddafi 's birthplace . \nWhile random gunfire broke out periodically across the city , some of its two million residents ventured out to stock up on supplies for the first time in days . \nAid agencies sounded an alarm about food , water and also medical supplies , especially for hundreds of wounded . \nBut the new leadership said it had found huge stockpiles in Tripoli which would ease the shortages . \nIn a sign that Libya 's rebel authority was gradually taking over the levers of power from Gaddafi , National Transitional Council official Ali Tarhouni said late on Thursday the body had begun a planned move from the eastern rebel bastion of Benghazi to Tripoli . \n`` I proclaim the beginning of the resumption of the work of the executive office in Tripoli , '' Tarhouni , who is in charge of oil and financial matters for the council , told reporters at a briefing in the capital . \nThe shift is seen as a crucial step to smoothing over rifts in the country , fragmented by regional and tribal divisions , particularly between east and west . \nNonetheless , in order to begin installing an administration in a nation run by an eccentric personality cult for 42 years , to offer jobs to young men now bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war , Libya 's new masters are anxious for hard cash quickly . \nThe United States and South Africa struck a deal late on Thursday to allow the release of $ 1.5 billion in frozen Libya funds for humanitarian aid and other civilian needs , U.N. diplomats said . \nSome governments , notably in Africa where there was some sympathy for Gaddafi 's view of his Western enemies as colonialist aggressors , had been reluctant to agree to the deal . \nAfter a meeting of officials in Istanbul , the Contact Group of allies against Gaddafi called on Libyans to avoid revenge . \n`` The participants attached utmost importance to the realization of national reconciliation in Libya , '' it said . \n`` They agreed that such a process should be based on principles of inclusiveness , avoidance of retribution and vengeance . '' \nThe group also urged the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution freeing up cash quickly . \nJibril said the uprising , the bloodiest so far of the Arab Spring , could fall apart if funds were not forthcoming quickly : `` The biggest destabilizing element would be the failure ... to deliver the necessary services and pay the salaries of the people who have not been paid for months . \n`` Our priorities can not be carried out by the government without having the necessary money immediately , '' he said . \nGaddafi 's opponents fear that he may rally an insurgency , as did Saddam Hussein in Iraq , should he remain at large and , perhaps , in control of funds salted away for such a purpose . \nWestern powers , mindful of the bloodshed in Iraq , have made clear they do not want to engage their troops in Libya . \nBut a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Washington would look favorably on any Libyan request for U.N. police assistance -- something some say might aid a transition to democracy . \nRebel leaders , offering a million-dollar reward , say the war will be over only when Gaddafi is found , `` dead or alive . '' \nThe ex-international high representative in Bosnia , Paddy Ashdown , told Reuters there was a need for speed if Libya 's new rulers were to avoid a lingering threat from their predecessor , unlike what transpired in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq . \n`` The best time to capture these defeated leaders is immediately after the conflict finishes , '' Ashdown said . \n`` The longer it takes the more chance they have of being spirited away to a place which is much more difficult to find .

{"id": "57", "time": "2011-10-20", "text": "LONDON | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 6:51 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Jockeying for power among Libya 's well-armed and fractious new leadership may intensify after the death of Muammar Gaddafi , an anxious and , for many , joyous moment in a country hungry for stability and impatient to swap the bullet for the ballot box . \nThe interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . \nGaddafi 's death is expected to allow Libya to start earning money again by selling its oil on world markets as a more benign security environment allows oilfield staff to get back to work . \nBut perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . \n`` There is now this massive expectation . \nUp to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . \nThey do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . \n`` That 's a hard task . \nThey have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' \nThe news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his home town Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . \nThe capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . \nAn announcement that the country has achieved `` liberation '' is expected on Saturday , setting in motion a transition to democratic elections . \nSome fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . \n`` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . \n`` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' \nBut the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . \nLibya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' \nBut he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' \nUnder rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . \nOn declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . \nA 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . \nThe national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . \nSome worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . \nNow he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . \nWarren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . \n`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . \nIn recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . \nU.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . \n`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . \n`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . \nThat may be a dangerous road .

{"id": "101", "time": "2011-10-20", "text": "SIRTE , Libya | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Disturbing images of a blood-stained and shaken Muammar Gaddafi being dragged around by angry fighters quickly circulated around the world after the Libyan dictator 's dramatic death near his home town of Sirte . \nThe exact circumstances of his demise are still unclear with conflicting accounts of his death . \nBut the footage of the last chaotic moments of Gaddafi 's life offered some clues into what happened . \nGaddafi was still alive when he was captured near Sirte . \nIn the video , filmed by a bystander in the crowd and later aired on television , Gaddafi is shown dazed and wounded being dragged off a vehicle 's bonnet and pulled to the ground by his hair . \n`` Keep him alive , keep him alive ! '' \nGaddafi then goes out of view and gunshots ring out . \n`` They captured him alive and while he was being taken away , they beat him and then they killed him , '' one senior source in the NTC told Reuters . \n`` He might have been resisting . '' \nIn what appeared to contradict the events depicted in the video , Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council said Gaddafi was killed when a gunfight broke out after his capture between his supporters and government fighters . \nHe died from a bullet wound to the head , the prime minister said . \nThe NTC said no order had been given to kill him . \nGaddafi called the rebels who rose up against his 42 years of one-man rule `` rats , '' but in the end it appeared that it was he who was captured cowering in a drainage pipe full of rubbish and filth . \n`` He called us rats , but look where we found him , '' said Ahmed Al Sahati , a 27-year-old government fighter , standing next to two stinking drainage pipes under a six-lane highway near Sirte . \nOn the ground , government fighters described scenes of carnage as they told stories of Gaddafi 's final hours . \nShortly before dawn prayers , Gaddafi , surrounded by a few dozen loyal bodyguards and accompanied by the head of his now non-existent army Abu Bakr Younis Jabr , broke out of the two-month siege of Sirte and made a break for the west . \nThey did not get far . \nFrance said its aircraft struck military vehicles belonging to Gaddafi forces near Sirte at about 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 0630 GMT -RRB- , but said it was unsure whether the strikes had killed Gaddafi . \nA NATO official said the convoy was hit either by a French plane or a U.S. Predator drone . \nTwo miles west of Sirte , 15 pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns lay burned out , smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road . \nThey had clearly been hit by a force far beyond anything the motley army the former rebels has assembled during eight months of revolt to overthrow the once feared leader . \nThere was no bomb crater , indicating the strike may have been carried out by a jet fighter . \nInside the trucks still in their seats sat the charred skeletal remains of drivers and passengers killed instantly by the strike . \nOther bodies lay mutilated and contorted strewn across the grass . \nSome 50 bodies in all . \nMansour Daou , leader of Gaddafi 's personal bodyguards , was with the former strongman shortly before his end . \nHe told al Arabiya television that after the air strike the survivors had `` split into groups and each group went its own way . '' \n`` I was with Gaddafi and Abu Bakr Younis Jabr and about four volunteer soldiers . '' \nDaou said he had not witnessed his leader 's death because he had fallen unconscious after being wounded in the back by a shell explosion . \nFighters on the ground said Gaddafi and a handful of his men appeared to have run through a stand of trees and taken refuge in the two drainage pipes . \n`` At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns , but it was no use , '' said Salem Bakeer , while being feted by his comrades near the road . \n`` Then we went in on foot . \n`` One of Gaddafi 's men came out waving his rifle in the air and shouting surrender , but as soon as he saw my face he started shooting at me , '' he told Reuters . \n`` Then I think Gaddafi must have told them to stop . \n` My master is here , my master is here ' , he said , ` Muammar Gaddafi is here and he is wounded ' , '' said Bakeer . \n`` We went in and brought Gaddafi out . \nHe was saying ` what 's wrong ? \nWhat 's going on ? ' . \nThen we took him and put him in the car , '' Bakeer said . \nAt the time of his capture , Gaddafi was already wounded with gunshots to his leg and to his back , Bakeer said . \nOther government fighters who said they took part in Gaddafi 's capture , separately confirmed Bakeer 's version of events , though one said the man who ruled Libya for 42 years was shot and wounded at the last minute by one of his own men . \n`` One of Muammar Gaddafi 's guards shot him in the chest , '' said Omran Jouma Shawan . \nThere were also other versions of events . \nNTC official Abdel Majid Mlegta told Reuters Gaddafi had been finally cornered in a compound in Sirte after hours of fighting , and wounded in a gun battle with NTC forces . \nHe said Gaddafi kept repeating `` What is the matter ? \nWhat 's going on ? \nWhat do you want ? '' \nand resisted as NTC fighters seized him . \nHe added that Gaddafi died of his wounds as he was being transported in an ambulance . \n`` He was bleeding from his stomach . \nIt took a long time to transport him . \nHe bled to death -LRB- in the ambulance -RRB- , '' he said . \nAnother NTC official , speaking to Reuters anonymously , gave a violent account of Gaddafi 's death : `` They -LRB- NTC fighters -RRB- beat him very harshly and then they killed him . \nThis is a war . '' \nSome video footage showed what appeared to be Gaddafi 's lifeless body being loaded into an ambulance in Sirte . \nOne of the fighters who said he took part in the capture brandished a heavily engraved golden pistol he said he had taken from Gaddafi . \nFallen electricity cables partially covered the entrance to the pipes and the bodies of three men , apparently Gaddafi bodyguards lay at the entrance to one end , one in shorts probably due to a bandaged wound on his leg . \nFour more bodies lay at the other end of the pipes . \nAll black men , one had his brains blown out , another man had been decapitated , his dreadlocked head lying beside his torso . \nArmy chief Jabr was also captured alive , Bakeer said . \nNTC officials later announced he was dead . \nJoyous government fighters fired their weapons in the air , shouted `` Allahu Akbar '' and posed for pictures . \nOthers wrote graffiti on the concrete parapets of the highway . \nOne said simply : `` Gaddafi was captured here .

'' \nLooming large in U.S. officials ' minds is the violence that spiraled out of control in Iraq following Saddam Hussein 's capture , trial and execution , which kept the United States in Iraq for years at great financial and human cost . \nThe Gaddafi government 's downfall in August and now his death will go some way to validating what became known as the `` Obama doctrine , '' in which Washington , unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan , played a more modest role rather than acting as de facto leader of an anemic coalition . \nFollowing initial criticism for failing to act quickly in Libya , U.S. officials went to great lengths after the early weeks of the air campaign to make NATO the face of international military assistance for the ragtag rebel force . \nDespite the Pentagon 's heavy lifting on refueling , logistics and surveillance , nations like France and Britain embraced more forward-leaning military and diplomatic roles . \nStill , given its military might , Washington may find itself playing an important role even after the NATO mission ends in providing training and other assistance to the new Libyan military or making use of its unique air assets . \nPerhaps the biggest question mark in determining the future U.S. role in Libya is the ability of its new leadership to stave off prolonged civil strife in an ethnically and tribally fractured country reeling after months of bloody conflict . \nAfter Gaddafi 's death , it remains unclear whether Libya 's motley array of new leaders , with their diverse ideologies , can forge a unified path in a country new to democracy or whether remaining Gaddafi supporters will keep putting up a fight . \n`` Now more than ever , the risk of them not succeeding has increased as the one thing that hung everyone together is gone , '' Bokhari said . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton articulated during a visit to Libya this week the widespread U.S. concerns about how well a host of militias can be streamlined into a single national army and about quickly establishing law and order . \nAnother obstacle for Libya , where Gaddafi commanded almost absolute power for decades , is its lack of strong government institutions that could smooth the path ahead . \n`` The success achieved thus far is very , very limited compared to the challenges that lie ahead , '' Les Gelb , an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , told reporters . \nEqually unclear is the precise nature of future U.S. nonmilitary involvement in the new Libya . \nSince the conflict began , the United States has spent at least $ 135 million on humanitarian and other aid to Libya , a paltry sum next to the billions of dollars it has poured into rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan . \nThe administration will likely aim to keep its financial support modest to an oil-rich country that already has billions of dollars in assets from the Gaddafi government at its disposal . \nWhile Clinton promised to expand support for a nascent democracy , she vowed to find public-private funding for other initiatives like treating war victims in the United States . \nAs the Obama administration scrambles to stave off a budget crisis , the State Department also announced this week it had not sought new congressional funding for aid to Libya . \nThat could change if robust aid fails to materialize from Europe -- where political leaders are staring down their own fiscal crisis -- and if Washington feels aid could fend off a risky destabilization for a region already gripped by change . \nThere could be also be big U.S. commercial interest in a country where recent years of expanded foreign investment halted in February with the start of the uprising . \nU.S. companies with operations in Libya include ConocoPhillips , Occidental and other firms involved in construction and oil field services . \n`` What U.S. business needs in any market is security and transparency and stability , '' said Chuck Dittrich , executive director of the U.S.-Libya Business Association . \n`` I think this enables Libya to close the book on 40 years of a nightmare . '' \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nShow the rest of the world that you know what to do now . \nCongratulations , part of the difficult part is over . \nThe rest will be to regain your footing , and repair your shattered country . \nBe a beacon for freedom and tolerance for others willing to follow your path , do n't allow yourselves to fall to petty infighting , OTHERS ARE WATCHING . \nAgain , the most heartfelt congratulations to you and your comrades , you did it . \nI do n't like when they kill the guys , unless it 's an imminent threat . \nGo ahead with the court process . \nDo n't tempt karma A completely insane venture , this war will cost far more lives than it purportedly tried to save . \nObama & Sarkozy looked for an easy target and political win against a figure that just about everybody loathed . \nBut he kept all the factions in check & the oil flowing . \nSo this venture gies against US national interests . \nAnd now al-Qaeda or other Islamists operating in Libya have access to huge oil resources and an excellent chance of taking over . \nAll thanks to their enemies us Americans , who footed the whole bill . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "195", "time": "2011-10-20", "text": "LONDON | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 11:46 am EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Jockeying for power among Libya 's well-armed and fractious new leadership may intensify after the death of deposed autocrat Muammar Gaddafi , an anxious and , for many , joyous moment in a country hungry for stability and impatient to swap the bullet for the ballot box . \nThe interim government will be determined to ensure that lingering pro-Gaddafi forces are prevented from launching any rearguard guerrilla insurgency from the countryside that could destabilize the north African OPEC member and its oil industry . \nOne of Gaddafi 's most politically influential sons , Saif al-Islam , and his security chief Abdullah Sanussi are apparently still at large and may still be able to recruit armed followers . \nBut perhaps the most important test for the interim National Transitional Council will be to manage the enormous expectations of Libya 's 6 million people , now freed definitively from the fear that Gaddafi could ever reimpose his long strongman rule . \n`` There is now this massive expectation . \nUp to now they 've had an excuse that they are running a war . \nThey do n't have that now ... Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . \n`` That 's a hard task . \nThey have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time . '' \nThe news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his hometown Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . \nThe capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . \nSome fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . \n`` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . \n`` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council . '' \nBut the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . \nLibya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' \nBut he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' \nUnder rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . \nOn declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . \nA 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . \nThe national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . \nSome worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . \nNow he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . \nWarren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . \n`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . \nIn recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . \nU.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . \n`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . \n`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . \nThat may be a dangerous road .

'' \nNo one at the talks gave details of the roadmap for peace in this oil-producing nation . \nRebels have said they will accept nothing less than an end to Gaddafi 's four decades in power , but Libyan officials say he will not quit . \n`` The brother leader delegation has accepted the roadmap as presented by us . \nWe have to give ceasefire a chance , '' Zuma said , adding that the African delegation would now travel to the eastern city of Benghazi for talks with anti-Gaddafi rebels . \nNATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor on Sunday to weaken the bitter siege of Misrata in the west and disrupt a dangerous advance by Gaddafi 's troops in the east . \nThe alliance said it destroyed 11 tanks on the outskirts of the eastern rebel town of Ajdabiyah , which looked in danger of being overrun on Sunday , and 14 near Misrata , a lone insurgent bastion in the west that has been under siege for six weeks . \nThere was no sign of any let-up in the fighting and despite the African leaders ' peace roadmap hopes of a negotiated settlement looked slim . \nA rebel spokesman rejected a deal with Gaddafi to end the conflict , bloodiest in a series of pro-democracy revolts across the Arab world that have ousted the autocratic leaders of Tunisia and Egypt . \n`` There is no other solution than the military solution , because this dictator 's language is annihilation , and people who speak this language only understand this language , '' spokesman Ahmad Bani told al Jazeera television . \nNATO said it had increased the tempo of its air operations over the weekend , after rebels accused it of responding too slowly to government attacks . \nThe insurgents hailed the more muscular approach . \nThe NATO strikes outside Ajdabiyah on Sunday helped break the biggest assault by Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern front for at least a week . \nThe town is the gateway to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi 150 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- north up the Mediterranean coast . \nA Reuters reporter saw six burning hulks surrounded by 15 charred and dismembered bodies in two sites 300 metres -LRB- 1,000 feet -RRB- apart on Ajdabiyah 's western approaches which rebels said were hit by air strikes . \n`` NATO has to do this to help us every single day . \nThat is the only way we are going to win this war , '' said 25-year-old rebel Tarek Obeidy , standing over the bodies . \nThe government attack , which began on Saturday , included a fierce artillery and rocket bombardment , while some of Gaddafi 's forces , including snipers , penetrated Ajdabiyah . \nRebels cowered in alleys for several hours under the bombardment . \nThe corpses of four rebels were found dumped on a roadside . \n`` Their throats were slit . \nThey were all shot a few times in the chest as well . \nI just could not stop crying when I saw them , '' said rebel Muhammad Saad . \n`` This is becoming tougher and tougher .

{"id": "235", "time": "2011-03-07", "text": "ROME | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:19 am EST ROME -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy , which did more than any other country to legitimize Libya and its mercurial leader , is going through a foreign policy nightmare as civil strife in its former colony threatens its energy supplies , international image and the stability of some of its blue chip companies . \n`` The stakes for our country are very high , '' said Roberto Aliboni , vice-president of Italy 's Institute for International Affairs , who argued in a recent report that Italy should take a clear stand against Gaddafi and invest in the opposition . \nBut Rome is moving cautiously , realizing it has the most to lose among European nations as events unfold in the North African nation just 300 miles from Italy 's southernmost island . \nSix months ago Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and other officials fawned over Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , treating him like royalty on his third visit to Italy in two years . \nNow , a 2008 `` friendship treaty '' that prohibited Italian bases from being used in any military action against Libya has been officially `` suspended '' while Italy seems to be grabbing at straws over what policy to take with Libya . \nThe numbers tell the story . \nItaly imports about 80 percent of its energy needs . \nAbout 32 percent of Libya 's oil output goes to Italy -- making up about 25 percent of Italy 's imports -- and about 12 percent of Italy 's gas comes from Libya . \nUnder the friendship treaty , Italy promised to pay Libya $ 5 billion in compensation over 25 years for colonial misdeeds . \nLibya has been spending petrodollars on stakes in Italian companies while Italian firms have won infrastructure and energy contracts in the country it ruled as a colony from 1911 to 1943 . \nThe web of commercial interests includes banking , textiles , cars , construction , railways , aerospace -- and soccer clubs . \nRome was de facto guarantor of Tripoli 's good behavior when Libya was warily welcomed back into the international community after renouncing terrorism and weapons of mass destruction . \nWhile leaders such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton dutifully went to Tripoli and appeared uneasy with Gaddafi , Italy pulled out all the stops and Berlusconi embraced him as `` my great friend . '' \nGian Antonio Stella , a commentator for the Corriere della Sera newspaper , argued that Italy has to feel more responsible for a positive outcome to the Libyan crisis because Rome `` revered and adulated '' Gaddafi until only a short while ago . \nWhen the Libyan unrest broke out Berlusconi seemed almost in denial , perhaps sensing that his one-on-one style of diplomatic relations had fallen flat , as Gaddafi returned to his old habit of insulting the former colonial power . \n`` In Gaddafi 's case this -LRB- Berlusconi 's personal style produced results that were grotesque and undignified , '' wrote political commentator and former ambassador Sergio Romano . \n`` We had to put up with the capriciousness of the colonel , his delays -LRB- in 2009 he failed to show up to address parliament -RRB- his insults , his uniforms , his tents in our parks , '' Romano said . \nRome 's behavior can have far-reaching effects for Italy . \n`` Political imprudence by the government can risk unleashing resentment from whatever Libya emerges from the current crisis , '' said Aliboni of the Institute for International Affairs . \n`` National interests would be gravely put at risk . '' \nIt is no surprise that Italy is no cheerleader for sanctions against Libya or of calls for the freezing of its assets or the imposition of a no-fly zone . \nRome has made clear that it is not considering unilaterally freezing Libyan holdings in Italian companies at present . \nLibya owns stakes in blue-chip Italian companies including bank UniCredit and defense company Finmeccanica , and the fate of its holdings have been under scrutiny since the European Union imposed sanctions on Libya . \nThe EU agreed last week to freeze the assets of Gaddafi and a list of senior Libyan officials after Libyan security forces used violence to crack down on protesters . \nBut since that list does not mention the country 's sovereign wealth fund , the Libyan Investment Authority -LRB- LIA -RRB- , or the Libyan central bank -- entities that hold stakes in Italian companies -- Italy does not plan to freeze the holdings , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters . \nThe question is where do the assets of Gaddafi and his family end and where do Libya 's assets begin . \n`` The problem is that in an authoritarian regime today , just like in the absolute monarchies of the medieval times , it is hard to distinguish between the personal goods of the sovereign and those of the state , '' said commentator Stefano Lepri in La Stampa newspaper . \nOther European countries have been more aggressive in their pursuit of assets linked to Gaddafi and his top aides . \nBritish publisher Pearson Plc last week said the LIA 's 3.2 percent stake in the company had been frozen because of the sanctions , while Austria has widened an asset freeze list to include a top official at the LIA . \nAlso making Italy 's position with Libya difficult is the prospect of a wave of illegal immigration , worse than the one that hit it in the early 1990s after the collapse of communism in Albania . \n`` The contrast between the moral imperative -LRB- to support democracy -RRB- and the political dividend is particularly stark because of the fear of the consequences the fall of Gaddafi 's regime could have on migration , '' said Emanuela Paoletti of the International Migration Institute at Oxford University . \nIn 2009 , Rome and Tripoli signed a deal allowing Italy 's coastguard to return boatloads of illegal immigrants to Libya Before then , Libya was a main staging post for illegal immigration from Africa and Gaddafi has made it clear that he could let the genie out of the bottle again if he wanted . \nHe told France 's Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that if he fell `` you will have immigration , thousands of people from Libya will invade Europe . \nThere will be no one to stop them any more .

'' \nGaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital . \nRebels were forced to retreat from Bin Jawad which is on the road to Sirte , the hometown of Gaddafi who has ruled the OPEC oil and gas producer for 41 years . \n`` Gaddafi 's cut us to pieces . \nHe 's firing on us with tanks and missiles . \nI do n't know what we 're going to do now , '' Momen Mohammed told Reuters . \nOne fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen . \n`` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more . \nRebels said they planned another attack on Bin Jawad , which is only 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- from Sirte , on Monday morning . \nRebel commanders told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces were reinforcing Sirte where they had more than 20,000 fighters . \nThey said the city houses the Saadi -LRB- a son of Gaddafi -RRB- battalion which includes four brigades , as well as armed tribe members . \nLoyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on Sunday firing into the air and holding portraits of Gaddafi . \n`` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east . \nBut the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control while insurgents stood their ground at Zawiyah and Misrata . \nRebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before . \n`` This morning , there was a new attack , bigger than yesterday . \nThere were one and a half hours of fighting ... Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone . \nElite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital . \n`` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them . \nThey retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named . \n`` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank . \nThe town is now fully in the control of the youths , '' he said . \nAt least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on Sunday , a doctor told Reuters by phone . \n`` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final . \nWe also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians . \nDoctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . \nA French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . \nBritain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi had now left Libya . \nThe Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured during a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . \n`` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . \nThey could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . \nFor our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said earlier . \nWestern leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . \nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . \n`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . \n`` The flow of money must be cut off .

'' \n-- The ground-based fighting so far has been in a stretch of desert along the Mediterranean coast . \nThe front line can move back and forth in this area without giving either side a significant military advantage , because there are no major population centers or bases in the area . \nThe stretch is bookended by two important locations : Ajdabiyah in the east , gateway to the rebels ' eastern strongholds , and in the west Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte . \nIf the fighting stays between these two locations , it amounts to stalemate . \n-- Foot-dragging among major Western powers about military intervention . \nForeign military help could tip the balance in favor of the rebels . \nMany Libya-watchers see this as the most likely outcome in the long-term , based on the calculation that Gaddafi 's forces have spilled too much blood in the last few weeks to retain legitimacy . \nThe question is , how quickly could such a victory come ? \n-- Can the rebels organize an effective military hierarchy ? \nSo far , the forces have shown more zeal than military skill . \nThe rebels ' National Libyan Council named Omar Hariri , one of the officers who took part in Gaddafi 's 1969 coup , as head of the military . \nBut it is not clear how much authority he would have . \nEvidence on the ground that fighters are wearing standard uniforms , have received training , are operating as units , and have radios to pass orders down the chain of command , would be the clearest signs that they are getting organized . \n-- Will the rebels in Misrata hold out ? \nThis city is the biggest population center still defying Gaddafi 's control outside the eastern regions . \nTroops from the 32nd Brigade , commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis and reputed to be the best forces in Libya , have so far failed to capture it . \nThis is telling about the quality of Gaddafi 's forces . \nIf they can not take an isolated city defended by armed civilians , they must have serious shortcomings . \n-- Outside military intervention . \nIf Western powers remain wary of intervening openly , then more discreet assistance -- sending in weapons or military advisers -- could also tip the scales toward the rebels . \n-- Can the rebels take Sirte ? \nIf they can , they will score the psychological victory of seizing Gaddafi 's hometown , and also control a major air base . '' \n-LRB- Sirte -RRB- controls the coast approach to Tripoli from the east and to the key nearby cities of Misrata and Zawiyah , which are the doorway to the Tripoli region , '' said Saad Djebbar , an Algerian lawyer and expert on Libya . \nThis is the least likely scenario , mainly because the rebels control a huge chunk of territory and seem very well entrenched there . \n`` Gaddafi has lost the east , '' said Djebbar , who advised Tripoli when two Libyans were tried for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing . \nBut Gaddafi is a proven survivor who has held on to power for more than four decades , so it is impossible to count him out . \nHe has around him a coterie of political and military supporters who have much to lose if the regime collapses . \nThe conflict could conceivably be decided in Tripoli , rather than the small towns on the coast , if senior military commanders or Gaddafi supporters decided the conflict could not be won . \n-- The eastern rebellion collapses under the weight of its own internal divisions and military weakness . \nThis may be the only real opportunity for Gaddafi to make a comeback . \n`` In the east , the opposition are holding but they need to be careful that they do n't collapse completely , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst with IHS Global Insight . \n-- Could the rebels hold together and hold the country together ? \nAll opposition in Libya has been stifled over forty years of Gaddafi rule and there are no organized civic groups to provide a ready basis for government . \nOne of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said Libya would descend into civil war if his father stepped down . \nHe said Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that the country 's tribes would fight against each other . \nThe focus of events could switch from the smaller towns of the Mediterranean coast . \n"}

{"id": "350", "time": "2011-03-07", "text": "President Barack Obama is pictured at Miami Central Senior High School March 4 , 2011 . \nWASHINGTON | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 5:49 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The White House pushed back on Monday against rising pressure from some lawmakers for direct intervention in Libya , saying it first wanted to figure out what various military options could achieve . \n`` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . \n`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' \nOfficials cautioned that a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , an idea popular among Democratic and Republican lawmakers , would be difficult to enforce and might not stop helicopter gunships from attacking rebels fighting to end Muammar Gaddafi 's four-decade rule . \nThe Obama administration has faced sharp criticism , especially from Republicans and conservative commentators , for being too cautious over the turmoil in Libya but has signaled it will not be rushed into hasty decisions that could suck the U.S. military into a new war and fuel anti-American sentiment . \nOne major obstacle : U.S. officials are still trying to identify the main actors within the opposition fighting to oust Gaddafi . \nThe aims of these groups are unclear and it is not even certain they view the United States favorably . \nCarney said the United States was trying to `` reach out '' to Gaddafi opponents through diplomats , business people and non-governmental groups . \nHe also had a fresh warning to Gaddafi 's close associates , saying U.S. intelligence agencies were seeking to identify those involved in the violence which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee the country . \nPresident Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals that we 've seen there . '' \nBut Kori Schake , an associate professor at West Point military academy , was critical of Obama 's statement , saying it followed a `` pattern of broad pronouncements without practical follow-through . '' \nThe White House has long said all options are on the table over Libya but , for the first time on Monday , it gave a vague priority to the possible military steps being studied . \nBottom of the list is sending in ground troops , Carney told a briefing . \nEnforcing a no-fly zone was a `` serious '' option , he said , as was a U.N. arms embargo and humanitarian assistance . \nArming the rebels was also a possibility , he added . \nBut State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley appeared to contradict Carney when he noted that a February 26 U.N. Security Council resolution barred all weapons transfers to Libya . \nCrowley also denied a British newspaper report that Washington had asked Saudi Arabia to supply weapons to rebels . \nMilitary analysts say the rebels do not appear to be short of weapons and the United States would be wary of providing arms that could end up in the wrong hands and be used against U.S. forces elsewhere . \nBrian Katulis , a Middle East expert who has informally advised the White House on the turmoil sweeping the region , said the Obama administration was constrained by its reluctance to act militarily without international support . \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated on Monday that any intervention in Libya would require broad backing . \nUnderscoring the lack of consensus , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow opposed military intervention . \nChina , a fellow veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council , has expressed similar misgivings . \nThe United States has deployed two amphibious assault ships off the Libyan coast , ostensibly to help with any humanitarian emergencies , while dispatching military transport aircraft to airlift stranded Egyptian refugees from neighboring Tunisia . \nOver the weekend , leading Republican and Democratic senators urged Obama to do more to help Libya 's rebels , who have fought Gaddafi 's security forces to a standstill in some areas but are all but powerless to stop repeated air strikes . \nMitch McConnell , the top Republican in the Senate , said one option was `` simply aiding and arming the insurgents , '' noting that the United States often did this during the Cold War . \nJohn Kerry , the influential Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is close to Obama , repeated his call for a no-fly zone and floated another idea -- bombing Libyan runways to ground Gaddafi 's warplanes . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIf any money is spent , we must have current year dollar for dollar cuts in the war budgets , both overt and covert , for Iraq and Afghanistan to compensate . \nNot next year , THIS year . \nWe can not afford the wars we already have . \nWe can afford to pay what we have already charged for for Medicare and Social Security . \nThe choice is clear . \nWe can not afford both . \nWe do not want these wars . \nThey are not in our best interest . \nGadaffi is likely to withstand NATO and other interventions and civil war will eventually decide the outcome ... it will take a lot of headlines before a solution unfolds . \nPrincipally because Libya does n't command a territorial army and tribal allegiance will ultimately decide who survives the conflict . \nGreat , another possible intervention in the Middle East , just what we need . \nMore American lives and funds at risk , when are we going to get out of other countries internal affairs and civil wars . \nWhy do n't we leave it to the Arab League and OPEC to handle . \nWhat happens if Saudi Arabia starts to have internal problems , are we going to intervene against the government there with military force ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAjdabiyah 's streets were almost deserted by mid-afternoon and rebels barricaded the roads with concrete blocks , tree branches and anything they could find for fear of an attack . \nRebel pick-ups patrolled the streets and men took up positions across the town with machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers . \nOthers returned to positions at the western gate with their weapons pointed west and south into the desert . \n`` We are ready for a street war . \nWe have got dynamite and we 've got grenades , '' said rebel fighter Emtar el-Farjany , who was holding a stick of dynamite . \nSome rebels on Saturday made it into the outskirts of Brega , 50 miles to the west , but many others retreated to Ajdabiyah after six were killed by rockets fired by Gaddafi loyalists on the exposed coastal road joining the two towns . \nBy Sunday , scores of volunteer fighters and civilian cars carrying men , women and children streamed east from Ajdabiyah up the coast road toward Benghazi , where the popular revolt against Gaddafi 's 41-year rule began on February 17 . \nSunday marks a month since the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorising force to protect civilians in Libya , leading to an international air campaign . \nBut despite NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's armor , rebels have been unable to hold gains in weeks of back-and-forth fighting over the coastal towns in eastern Libya . \n`` From a military point of view , one can currently see there is a stalemate , '' the head of Germany 's intelligence service Ernst Uhrlau told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper . \n`` One can not predict at the moment how much longer Gaddafi can hold onto power . \nThe area around Tripoli is much stronger in terms of the population and the tribes than the east , '' he said . \nIn western Libya , the rebel-held city of Misrata has been under government siege for seven weeks , leading to a growing humanitarian crisis . \nHundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed in the fighting and shelling of the city . \nA rebel spokesman said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded Misrata again on Sunday , killing at least six people . \nAbdel Basset Mezerik said at least 47 people were also wounded . \nThe United States , France and Britain said last week they would not stop bombing Gaddafi 's forces until he left power . \nWith NATO troops bogged down in Afghanistan , Western countries have however ruled out sending ground troops , a position reinforced by the British prime minister on Sunday . \n`` What we 've said is there is no question of invasion or an occupation -- this is not about Britain putting boots on the ground , '' David Cameron told Sky News in an interview . \nBut he said outside powers would help in every other way to stop Gaddafi `` unleashing this hell on people in Misrata '' and other towns up and down the Libyan coast , including providing `` non-lethal equipment '' to the rebels . \nEuropean Council President Herman van Rompuy said he viewed the Libyan rebel council as `` a valuable discussion partner ... that embodies the Libyan people 's aspirations , '' a political vote of confidence for a force which has struggled militarily . \nEarlier on Sunday a sandstorm obscured the flat expanse of desert stretching west from Ajdabiyah to Brega . \nRebel Ahmed al-Zuwaihi blamed the weather for a lack of NATO air strikes . \n`` The weather is no good today . \nNATO has n't hit anything , '' he said . \n`` It 's a big opportunity for Gaddafi and he 's taking advantage of it . \nHe might enter Ajdabiyah today . \nToday the planes are not going to hit anything .

'' \nbut they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi 's forces were still there . \nIn the port city of Misrata , the rebels ' biggest enclave in western Libya , the plight of residents worsened . \nRebels accused Gaddafi 's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now . \nA rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction . \n`` Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata , '' he said . \nGaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm 's way . \nRebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas . \n`` Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center , '' he said . \n`` The ball is now in NATO 's court . \nAfter Gaddafi 's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters , their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts . \nThis can only be solved by NATO . '' \nThe Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected . \nBut military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts , with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution . \nAt least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead . \nIt was not immediately clear what the targets were . \nThe official Libyan news agency Jana also said that `` the colonial , crusader aggression '' hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening . \nTwo people were killed and many others were wounded , it said . \nGaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert , state television reported . \n`` Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs , '' it quoted a military spokesman as saying . \nBut rebels denied this . \n`` The battle is not over and the situation is unclear , '' said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser . \n"}

Security Council is split on whether to authorize a no-fly zone over Libya as Britain and France consider tougher options for Tripoli , including setting up an escrow account for oil revenues , envoys said on Wednesday . \nBritain and France have been preparing a draft U.N. resolution that would authorize a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent airstrikes against civilians in the North African country where rebels are seeking to oust long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi . \nThe United States , however , has made clear to London and Paris that the administration of President Barack Obama is in the throes of a policy review and is not ready `` to go full steam ahead on a no-fly zone at the moment , '' a Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity . \nThe British and French , however , are consulting with Washington and other allies so that they are ready to submit a draft resolution to the 15-nation Security Council immediately in the event of an `` egregious act '' against civilians by forces loyal to Gaddafi . \n`` If they were to bomb a school and kill a dozen children , the French and British are ready to move immediately with a draft on the no-fly zone issue , '' another diplomat said . \nBut the idea of a no-fly zone lacks sufficient support at the moment among council members . \nVeto powers China and Russia dislike it , India and South Africa are skeptical , and the Americans are undecided , envoys said . \n`` If we put it on the table today , I do n't think there would be enough support for it , '' a diplomat said . \nBut he added that no council members had categorically ruled it out . \nIn order to pass , Security Council resolutions need nine votes in favor and no vetoes from the five permanent members , which also include the United States , Britain and France . \n`` Other options are being discussed , '' another diplomat said . \n`` One of those is an escrow account for Libyan oil revenues to prevent Gaddafi from getting all the nation 's oil money . '' \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague told parliament this week that a U.N.-administered escrow account similar to one set up for Iraq in the 1990s was an option being considered by Britain and its allies . \nThe United Nations ' `` oil-for-food '' program in Iraq -- which allowed Iraq to sell oil in order to buy humanitarian goods -- was hit with allegations of widespread corruption , and U.N. officials have said privately that there is little appetite to get back in the business of administering oil revenues . \nLibya 's deputy U.N. ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi , whose denunciation of Gaddafi last month sparked dozens of defections of Libyan envoys worldwide , said he did not support the idea . \n`` There is no need for this , '' Dabbashi , a key member of the Libyan opposition , told Reuters . \n`` We have a government in place ready to take power . \nWe do n't support an escrow account .

Security Council Resolution 1970 , which imposed a comprehensive arms embargo in February . \nGaddafi 's forces in Bir al-Ghanam know the rebels are watching them from the ridge . \nAt one point on Thursday they fired mortars and artillery , sending people running for cover . \nThe town is just an hour 's drive from Aziziyah on Tripoli 's southern outskirts , and a similar distance from Zawiyah , which controls the coastal highway that links Tripoli to the Tunisian border and the outside world . \nA trickle of fighters from around the region joined them throughout the day . \nSome came from Zintan , in the mountains behind them , while others said they had made their way clandestinely from Zawiyah , where Gaddafi 's forces have put down two revolts since February . \nThe rebels encouraged more arms deliveries . \n`` Giving -LRB- us -RRB- weapons we will be able to decide the battle more quickly , so that we can shed as little blood as possible , '' senior rebel figure Mahmoud Jibril said in Vienna . \nThe rebels advance in the west contrasts with little progress east of Tripoli , increasing frustration among NATO allies over a three-month-old air campaign to back the rebels that has exceeded costs and time-frames originally envisaged . \nFrance , Britain and the United States say the air campaign will not end until Gaddafi falls . \nThe war has become the bloodiest of the `` Arab Spring '' uprisings sweeping North Africa and the Middle East . \nParis says it has not violated the U.N. embargo because the weapons it gave the rebels were needed to protect civilians from an imminent attack , which a later resolution seems to endorse . \n`` We believe that U.N. Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , read together , neither specified nor precluded providing defense materiel to the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` We would respectfully disagree with the Russian assessment , '' he added . \nNevertheless , the United States had not taken steps to arm the rebels , he said . \nRebels acknowledged French support , saying it had helped sustain them in the region . \n`` There should be no doubt that Libyans in the Nafusa Mountain -LRB- Western Mountains -RRB- area are alive and safe today thanks to a combination of heroic Libyan bravery and French wisdom and support , '' Vice Chairman Abdul Hafeedh Ghoga of the Transitional National Council said in a statement . \nLibyan television broadcast a statement from tribal leaders condemning French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the arms , calling the rebels in the Berber area `` a product of France . '' \nBut the rebel advance towards Tripoli 's southwest outskirts from the Western Mountains has not been matched by progress towards the capital from the east , where they hold Misrata on the coast about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- from the capital . \nThe city has been bombarded for months by Gaddafi 's forces . \nSix rockets landed early on Thursday near the oil refinery and port . \nA Reuters journalist there reported no casualties . \nInsurgents say Gaddafi 's forces are massing and bringing weapons to quell an uprising in Zlitan , the next big town along the road from Misrata to the capital . \nRebels inside Zlitan said they mounted a raid on pro-Gaddafi positions on Wednesday night and killed three men in an army patrol on Thursday morning . \nFrance 's weapons airlift , while possibly increasing the insurgent threat to Gaddafi , highlights a dilemma for NATO . \nMore than 90 days into its bombing campaign , Gaddafi is still in power and no breakthrough is in sight , making some NATO members feel they should help the rebels more actively , something the poorly-armed insurgents have encouraged . \nBut if they do that , they risk fracturing the international coalition over how far to go . \nRussia is not involved in the air campaign , but its stance could add to reservations among some NATO countries over the air war . \nMoscow could also challenge Paris at the U.N. Security Council , where both are veto-wielding permanent members . \nU.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said it was up to the Security Council to determine what is permitted by its resolutions . \nEven before news of the French arms supply emerged , fissures were emerging in the coalition over the high cost , civilian casualties and the elusiveness of a military victory . \nGaddafi says the NATO campaign is an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing the North African state 's oil . \nHe says NATO 's U.N.-mandated justification for its campaign -- to protect Libyan civilians from attack -- is spurious . \nThe World Bank 's Libya representative said on Thursday Islamist militants could gain ground if the conflict wears on . \n`` If this civil war goes on , it would be a new Somalia , which I do n't say lightly . \nIn three months we could be dealing with extremists , '' said Marouane Abassi , World Bank country manager for Libya who has been in Tunisia since February . \nGaddafi 's daughter Aisha told French 2 television the government was involved in talks with the rebels . \n`` There are direct and indirect negotiations and we should stop letting Libyan blood , '' she said in an interview aired on Thursday . \n`` And for that we are ready to ally with the devil and that is the armed rebels .

{"id": "133", "time": "2011-04-26", "text": "BRUSSELS | Tue Apr 26 , 2011 12:42 pm EDT BRUSSELS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Western bombing campaign in Libya is now in its sixth week but despite a series of eye-catching NATO initiatives there is little sign of a decisive military shift that will bring a quick end to the war . \nAnd there are few signs either of significant divisions within Muammar Gaddafi 's government that would hasten a political solution to the conflict . \nNATO , which took over the air campaign from a coalition led by France , Britain and the United States a month ago , can point to some successes in protecting civilian populations in eastern Libya from attack including in Benghazi and Ajdabiyah . \nBut the siege of Misrata continues and the commander of the NATO operation , Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , conceded on Tuesday that the alliance had yet to remove the threat posed to civilians by Gaddafi 's forces . \nIn the past week , a broadening of NATO 's bombing campaign to strikes on Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound , Washington 's announcement that it was deploying armed drones , and the withdrawal of government forces from central Misrata , might suggest the start of a shift away from a military stalemate . \nBut analysts say these moves in part reflect a practical reality -- that an initial air campaign has run out of clear , purely military targets that are easy to hit without endangering civilians -- and the need for Western governments to maintain support for the effort by showing they are making a difference . \n`` Militarily , the fact is , the situation is not much different from what it was at the very beginning of the war , '' said French strategic analyst Francois Heisbourg . \n`` Gaddafi is essentially controlling the same territory as he was at the beginning of the war , so he is not likely to leave power readily as part of a negotiated deal . \nSo from the standpoint of the coalition it 's not a great result . '' \nShashank Joshi of London 's Royal United Services Institute said Gaddafi had shown himself a more adaptable and flexible adversary than the Western powers would have hoped . \n`` His forces have adapted extremely well , '' Joshi said . \nWhile there had been an escalation of the political aims of the Western mission , given the statement this month by the leaders of France , Britain and the United States pledging to continue the military campaign until Gaddafi gives up power , there was less sign of a stepping up of the military effort , Joshi said . \n`` People are synthesizing the bombing of Gaddafi 's compound and the introduction of drones and advisers to say this is an escalation . \nThese are all incremental and will not make a difference in themselves . \n`` It 's actually a new way to compensate for the slowing of airstrikes , '' he said , referring to a decline in air activity since NATO took over the operation and the United States stepped back from an overt front-line role . \nTomas Valasek of the Center for European Reform think tank said that despite NATO denials , it did appear the key alliance powers -- France , Britain and the United States -- were seeking a way around the Gaddafi dilemma by targeting him directly . \n`` NATO 's official mandate does n't involve removing Gaddafi from power , so the commanders would deny it and say they are going after communications posts and such , but to me it does smell that they are going after Gaddafi personally . \n`` That would mean a gap between what NATO collectively says it wants to do and what the French , the British and Americans say . \nThat 's going to be a tough issue internally and it seems bound to create tensions within NATO , '' he said . \nNick Witney of the European Council on Foreign Relations said French , British and U.S. leaders had put pressure on themselves by declaring their mission to be regime change . \n`` Unfortunately that 's something that can not be achieved by bombing , '' he said . \n`` There should be no particular time pressure on this , but you have to accept a war aim of disengagement , ceasefire and negotiations . \nIt 's a mistake to conflate military action and regime change . '' \nValasek said the fact that Britain , France and Italy were sending in military advisers showed they were aware they were unlikely to succeed quickly . \n`` It speaks of a long-term strategy , '' he said . \n`` They have a dilemma : there 's no end to the war without an end to the Gaddafi regime . \nAnd short of turning the rebels into a proper fighting force and supporting them from the air , there is no good way of forcing Gaddafi to resign . '' \nAny progress so far had been marginal , he said . \n`` To use a tug-of-war analogy , you are talking about a few inches left and right , '' he said . \n`` They 're still a mile way from the ultimate political end goal of removing Gaddafi from power . '' \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nGiven the fact that Israel has historically prioritized the goal of having substantial influence in our U.S. government , I 'm wondering how the government is dealing with the fact that an Israeli corporation , reportedly charging $ 2,000 per African mercenary while paying the mercenary $ 100\\/day , is essentially turning what should have been a short conflict into an on-going business windfall . \nLikewise , I 'm wondering how it 's playing in Washington D.C. when the U.S. is sending U.S. pilots into a warzone whose Israeli-backed mercenaries are shooting at them while numerous pro-Israeli lobbyists , attorneys , government aides , and other Washington , D.C. influentials continue to shape policy concerning the war . \nIf our purported friends are going to support our enemies then we need to determine who our friends really are before engaging in wars incapable of being won or assisting Israel in protecting itself against Middle East threats to it 's freedom and sovereignty only to watch it profiteer on the slaughter of students and civilians fighting for democratic freedom being choked by the grip of a mass-murdering psychopath . \nI was all for the U.S. assisting the rebels in fighting for democracy before I came to discover this unexpected obstacle . \nNow it appears as though this thing might very well drag out for years and years as we continue to send young , naive military personnel into a war knowing they are likely to be killed or wounded by our friends working against us . \nI 've never understood our relationship with Israel to begin with though I suspect it 's largely a product of Israeli influence within our own government . \nIf that 's the case , then we need to identify pro-Israeli individuals who , by virtue of their political leanings , have a conflict of interest if they also occupy an influential or sensitive position within our own government or it 's civilian support system . \nAllowing someone to influence war decisions who is closely allied with the primary backer of our enemy is the grossest form of negligence . \nWhen a U.S. pilot is shot down with Israeli equipment and mercenaries , there will be no excuse that could work from any part of the Administration . \nIf the government chooses to commit innocent military personnel to this good cause knowing that it will continue because Israel will continue support , then it is knowingly sending our young citizens into a perpetual meat grinder . \nYou know how those work , do n't you ? \nTake a look at Viet Nam , Iraq , Afghanistan ? \n, and other protracted wars that took far longer than expected to reach a failing conclusion . \nThis is the kind of BS that the American public is wretchedly disgusted with . \nIt is the type of behavior that makes U.S. Citizens blindly enraged about our government . \nWith the economy as it is , we might very well be the next country to have a revolution if our government becomes any more abusive of the poor and middle classes . \nWhat international friend would the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries call upon for help this time as the Founding Fathers did some 235 years ago by sending Benjamin Franklin to France to plead for assistance in rebelling against the British ? \nCould the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on France again to provide the support that changed the outcome of the Revolutionary War in 1776 and stopped the abuses of the British government ? \nIt 's certainly possible again , I suppose . \nThe French still love to love but they also love a good fight when it 's about right and wrong . \nThey 're in Libya now spearheading the alliance . \nCould the U.S. Citizen revolutionaries count on Israel to help free them from an abusive government ? \nThe first question one should ask is , what is NATO doing in this Libyo-Libyan war ? \nIt is clearly a civil war . \nWhy should NATO be involved in it ? \nWhy should NATO side towards the rebels ? \nWhy does NATO want to kill Khadafi ? \nOne thing is clear , NATO is not involved in this civil war to protect the civilians . \nThis is an excuse for intervention but is not the true reason , otherwise NATO should be involved in the unrest of other countries including Syria . \nNATO 's interest is purely economic ? \nHas Khadafi refused to renew or extend any oil contract with Britain ? \nThis might be the case . \nIs Khadafi 's involvement in some African satellite communication projects affecting major communication companies in Europe ? \nAgain , this seems to be the case . \nSo , it might be that the involvement of NATO is a chastisement operation designed to punish Khadafi for not extending an oil contract and to cut down the revenues of a European communication company . \nAnd in this chastisement operation , thousands of Libyans have been killed by NATO bombs and billions of dollars ' worth of Libyan assets have been destroyed . \nHas NATO the right to kill people and destroy assets that belong to Libya ? \nIs this not a crime that should be severely punished ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "318", "time": "2011-04-19", "text": "LONDON | Tue Apr 19 , 2011 8:42 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Britain said on Tuesday it would send military officers to advise Libyan rebels , worrying critics who fear the country is being dragged into a civil war . \nLondon said it would send about a dozen officers to Libya to help insurgents improve their organization and communications , but would not arm the rebels or train them to fight . \nWith the Libyan conflict risking getting bogged down in a long stalemate , Western powers are searching for ways to bolster the rebels , whose military campaigns have been disorganised . \nForeign Secretary William Hague said the decision to send military advisers was in line with a United Nations ' resolution aimed at protecting civilians in Libya and denied Britain was putting military `` boots on the ground . '' \n`` There is going to be no ground invasion of Libya , '' Hague told the BBC . \nThe U.N. resolution bars an occupation force in Libya . \nBritain 's move is likely to anger Russia , which has already said that Western attempts to topple Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi violate a U.N. resolution which only authorised the use of force to protect civilians . \n`` The U.N. Security Council never aimed to topple the Libyan regime , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Belgrade on Tuesday . \n`` All those who are currently using the U.N. resolution for that aim are violating the U.N. mandate . '' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told reporters on Tuesday he also opposed sending troops into Libya . \nBut a French diplomatic source told Reuters Paris might send military liaison officers to Libya in the days ahead . \nBritain 's move also caused some dissent among supporters of British Prime Minister David Cameron 's coalition government . \nSeveral lawmakers from Cameron 's Conservative Party called for the recall of parliament , now in recess , to debate the move , saying that the ground had shifted since parliament approved British participation in the Libya no-fly zone last month . \nConservative member of parliament John Baron said there was clear evidence of `` mission creep . '' \n`` What the no-fly zone has effectively become is the air force of the rebels , '' he told Sky News . \nPeter Bone , another Conservative lawmaker , voiced concern that Britain seemed to be `` taking sides in a civil war . '' \nBritain 's recent experiences in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , where hundreds of British soldiers were killed , have led to caution about new foreign military ventures . \nThe leaders of the United States , Britain and France pledged last week to continue the military campaign until Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi leaves power . \nBritain 's Foreign Office said the team would advise the rebel interim national council on how to improve its organization , communications and logistics , but would not help plan rebel military operations . \nBritain says it has supplied rebels with telecommunications equipment and body armor but not arms . \n"}
