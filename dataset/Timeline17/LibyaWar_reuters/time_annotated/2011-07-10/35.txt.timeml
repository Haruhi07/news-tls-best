Rebel fighters in western Libya faced sustained artillery and rocket bombardment by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi for the fifth straight day on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-07-09">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
TRIPOLI | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-07-10">Jul 10 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2011-07-10T19:13">7:13 pm</TIMEX3> EDT TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - A French minister said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-07-10">Sunday</TIMEX3> it was time for Libya 's rebels to negotiate with Muammar Gaddafi 's government , but Washington said it stood firm in its belief that the Libyan leader can not stay in power .
The diverging messages from two leading members of the Western coalition opposing Gaddafi hinted at the strain the alliance is under after <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three months</TIMEX3> of air strikes that have cost billions of dollars and failed to produce the swift outcome its backers had expected .
French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet signaled growing impatience with the progress of the conflict when he said the rebels should negotiate <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with Gaddafi 's government and not wait for his defeat .
The rebels have so far refused to hold talks as long as Gaddafi is still in power , a stance which before <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> none of NATO 's major powers has publicly challenged .
` ` We have ... have asked them to speak to each other , '' Longuet , whose government has until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been among the most hawkish on Libya , said on French television station BFM TV .
` ` The position of the TNC -LRB- rebel Transitional National Council
-RRB- is very far from other positions .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , there will be a need to sit around a table , '' he said . ''
Asked if it was possible to hold talks if Gaddafi had not stepped down , Longuet said : ` ` He will be in another room in his palace with another title . ''
Soon after , the State Department in Washington issued a message that gave no hint of compromise .
` ` The Libyan people will be the ones to decide how this transition takes place , but we stand firm in our belief that Gaddafi can not remain in power , '' the department said in a written reply to a query .
It also said the United States would continue efforts , as part of the NATO coalition , to protect civilians from attack and said it believed the alliance was helping ratchet up the pressure on Gaddafi .
Gaddafi has been defiantly holding on to power in the face of rebel attacks trying to break his 41 - year rule , NATO air strikes , economic sanctions and the defections of prominent members of his government .
With no imminent end to the conflict in sight , cracks are emerging inside the NATO alliance .
Some member states are balking at the burden on their recession - hit finances , and many are frustrated that there has been no decisive breakthrough .
But even countries which support a political solution have not answered the question of how a deal can be hammered out when the rebels and their Western backers say Gaddafi must go while the Libyan leader himself says that is not up for negotiation .
Strains over how to proceed in Libya are likely to surface on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-07-08">Friday</TIMEX3> when the contact group , which brings together the countries allied against Gaddafi , gathers in Istanbul for its next scheduled meeting .
There was no immediate reaction to the French minister 's comments from the rebel leadership at its headquarters in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi .
On the ground , rebel forces trying to march on Tripoli have made modest gains in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W26">the past week</TIMEX3> , but the fighting on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-07-10">Sunday</TIMEX3> underlined it would a long slog .
Gaddafi 's forces launched a heavy artillery bombardment to try to push back rebel fighters who <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-W26">last week</TIMEX3> seized the village of Al - Qawalish , 100 km -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli .
Al - Qawalish is a strategic battleground because if the rebels manage to advance beyond it they will reach the main highway leading north into the capital Tripoli .
A rebel fighter in the village , Amignas Shagruni , told Reuters that shells had been landing repeatedly <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past 24 hours</TIMEX3> from pro - Gaddafi forces positioned a few kilometres to the east .
But he said : ` ` No one was hurt , thank God . ''
During a 20 - minute period while Reuters visited the frontline east of Al - Qawalish , at least five shells landed .
However , they did not appear to be well targeted , striking random spots in the nearby hills .
Libya has been convulsed by a civil war since <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> when thousands of people , inspired by revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia , rose up against his 41 - year - rule .
That rebellion has <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> turned into the bloodiest of the ` ` Arab <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-SP">Spring</TIMEX3> '' uprisings sweeping the region .
Gaddafi sounded a new note of defiance on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-07-08">Friday</TIMEX3> .
In an audio recording broadcast on state television , he threatened to export the war to Europe in revenge for the NATO - led military campaign against him .
` ` Hundreds of Libyans will martyr in Europe .
I told you it is eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth , '' he said .
` ` You will regret it , NATO , when the war moves to Europe . ''
Hundreds of kilometres to the northeast of Al - Qawalish , another force of rebels is also trying to push toward Tripoli , though they too are facing tough resistance .
Fighters from the rebel - held city of Misrata , about 200 km -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , have fought their way west to the outskirts of Zlitan , the first in a chain of coastal towns blocking their progress toward the capital .
A spokesman for insurgents who are behind the pro - Gaddafi lines and inside Zlitan itself , said they had mounted their second attack on government troops in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
` ` The revolutionaries inside the town of Zlitan shelled the -LRB- pro - Gaddafi -RRB- brigades positioned on the coastal road on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-07-10">Sunday</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="TIME" value="2011-07-10T01:00">1:00 a.m.</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="TIME" value="2011-07-10T23:00">2300
GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- , killing at least seven people , '' a rebel spokesman , who identified himself as Mabrouk , told Reuters from Zlitan .
The account could not be verified independently because journalists have not been able to reach the town .
NATO launched its bombing campaign in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> after the U.N. Security Council authorised the use of all necessary means to protect civilians who rose up against Gaddafi .
Gaddafi says the rebels are armed criminals and al Qaeda militants .
He has called the NATO operation an act of colonial aggression aimed at stealing Libyan oil .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Hey rebels you should never have trusted the old colonial powers .
They just wanted to stop the flow of oil to get the price up for the real powers which is the big money that owns the oil of the world .
You should have expected that the french would get you killed in large numbers and do nothing for you .
US position is simply for Obama to save face .
His unwise , untimely call for regime change inserted the USA into the domestic politics of Libya ... for no reason .
Libya 's government if for Libyans to determine , not Barak H. Obama !
They were the very first to help the Libyan citizens fighting for their very lives and family members when Kadhafi began slaughtering them .
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that the Libyan citizens are on the offensive , the French tell the Libyan citizens to make peace with Khadafi .
The French politicians should put themselves in the mental shoes of those Libyans that have lost mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters , neighbors , and friends because Kadhafi the ` ` King of Kings , '' declared war on his own citizens .
Justice for the Libyan citizens will not be achieved until Kadhafi and his Nazi goons are dead or imprisoned for life .
