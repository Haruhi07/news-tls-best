The U.S. envoy to the United Nations told the Security Council on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> that troops loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi were increasingly engaging in sexual violence and some had been issued the impotency drug Viagra , diplomats said .
Several U.N. diplomats who attended a closed - door Security Council meeting on Libya told Reuters that U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice raised the Viagra issue in the context of increasing reports of sexual violence by Gaddafi 's troops .
` ` Rice raised that in the meeting but no one responded , '' a diplomat said on condition of anonymity .
The allegation was first reported by a British newspaper .
Pfizer Inc 's drug Viagra is used to treat impotence .
Diplomats said if it were true that Gaddafi 's troops were being issued Viagra , it could indicate they were being encouraged by their commanders to engage in rape to terrorize the population in areas that have supported the rebels .
That would constitute a war crime .
Several diplomats said Rice provided no evidence for the Viagra allegation , which they said was made in an attempt to persuade doubters the conflict in Libya was not just a standard civil war but a much nastier fight in which Gaddafi is not afraid to order his troops to commit heinous acts .
` ` She spoke of reports of soldiers getting Viagra and raping , '' a diplomat said .
` ` She spoke of Gaddafi 's soldiers targeting children , and other atrocities . ''
Rice 's statement , diplomats said , was aimed principally at countries like India , Russia and China , which have grown increasingly skeptical of the effectiveness of the NATO - led air strikes , which they fear have turned the conflict into a protracted civil war that will cause many civilian deaths .
Most council members , diplomats said , had expected Gaddafi 's government to collapse quickly .
They said the frustration felt by India , Russia and China would likely grow if the war dragged on .
The use of rape as a weapon during wartime has received increasing attention at the United Nations .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> , Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon appointed a special envoy on sexual violence during armed conflict , Margot Wallstrom .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04" mod="START">Earlier this month</TIMEX3> , Wallstrom chided the Security Council for failing to mention sexual violence in two <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> resolutions on Libya , despite having made the subject a priority .
Wallstrom said at the time that reports of rape in Libya remained unconfirmed but she cited the highly publicized case of Eman al - Obaidi , the woman who burst into a journalists ' hotel in Tripoli <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03">last month</TIMEX3> saying she had been raped by pro - government militiamen .
The International Criminal Court is already investigating whether Gaddafi 's government committed war crimes in its violent crackdown against demonstrators who demanded greater freedoms .
The crackdown sparked a rebellion that has turned into a civil war .
The U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment .
