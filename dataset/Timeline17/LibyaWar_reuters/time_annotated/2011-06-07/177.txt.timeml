\ * EU governments add six Libyan ports to sanctions list \ *
Move follows existing travel ban and asset freeze BRUSSELS , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">June 7</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
The European Union said on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">Tuesday</TIMEX3> six Libyan ports would be added to the list of assets frozen in sanctions imposed on Muammar Gaddafi 's government .
` ` The council of the European Union adopted a decision <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">today</TIMEX3> extending the assets freeze to six Libyan port authorities , in view of the gravity of the situation in the country , '' said a statement from the European Council , which represents all EU governments .
The statement did not give any details of what form the sanctions would take , but EU officials say they will make it illegal for European - operated ships to do business with the port authorities .
A one - month window has been left for existing contracts , one official said .
The EU has already imposed a travel ban and wide - ranging asset freeze against some Libyan officials and companies .
An EU diplomat said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-05">last month</TIMEX3> that EU experts had agreed to put six ports -- Tripoli , Zuara , Zawiyah , Al - Khoms , Ras Lanuf and Brega -- on the sanctions list .
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's government has been seeking to raise fuel imports by using a loophole in international sanctions after a campaign of Western air strikes against Libya .

nLDE74H1S0 -RRB- ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">Today</TIMEX3> 's action will help to prevent Gaddafi - controlled Libya from acquiring resources which are fuelling military activities , '' British foreign secretary William Hague said in a statement .
Civil war has crippled the refining industry and Gaddafi urgently needs fuel imports for his military and to keep civilian vehicles running in the areas he controls .
British Prime Minister David Cameron said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-05">last month</TIMEX3> Britain saw scope for tightening sanctions on oil and oil products against Gaddafi and Britain has pushed the new sanctions initiative .
-LRB- ID : nHOC002251 -RRB- European Union , U.N. and U.S. sanctions against Libya have been implemented via a list of companies that must be excluded from business transactions , but exports to western Libya or dealings with firms missing from the list are not forbidden .
The idea to target ports follows a similar EU decision on the Ivory Coast in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2012-01">January</TIMEX3> , to pressure then incumbent Laurent Gbagbo to quit after a presidential election he was widely seen to have lost .
The discussions may also involve the Libyan state - owned shipping company General National Maritime Transport Company , which is not on the sanctions list and has managed to bring at least one fuel cargo into west Libya .
