BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">Jun 7 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-06-07T24:37">12:37 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Russian envoy in rebel - held Benghazi on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-07">Tuesday</TIMEX3> said Moscow wanted to help bridge the rift in Libya , stepping up Kremlin efforts to play a prominent role in resolving the conflict .
` ` Some are looking to Benghazi , some are looking to Tripoli .
Russia sees its task as building a bridge between these two banks on which Libyan society <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stands , '' said Mikhail Margelov , President Dmitry Medvedev 's special envoy to Africa .
At a G8 summit <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-05">last month</TIMEX3> , Medvedev joined Western partners in urging Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down , offered Russia 's services as a mediator and said he was sending Margelov to Libya , initially to Benghazi .
Analysts say Russia wants to preserve its influence in a country where it had billions of dollars in arms , energy and railroad deals .
` ` Russia has a unique situation in Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> : We did not sever relations with Tripoli , we have established relations with Benghazi , '' Margelov told Russia 's state - run Rossiya-24 television upon arrival in Benghazi .
` ` We are ready , if it 's possible , to act as middlemen in establishing an internal Libyan political dialogue .
Russia is ready to help politically , economically and in any possible way , '' Margelov told a media conference in Benghazi .
` ` We ... believe that Gaddafi has lost his legitimacy after the first bullet shot against the Libyan people , '' he said , adding democracy in Libya would be achieved through elections that would take place after the civil war ends .
Medvedev had said he hoped Margelov would have the opportunity to speak with both sides , but that he did not travel to Tripoli on this visit .
He left for Cairo after his talks , Russian media reported .
Margelov met Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebel national council , Russian media said .
He was also to have met Ali Tarhouni , the rebel minister of oil and finance , to discuss the financial situation and more effective aid .
Russia supported an initial U.N. Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Gaddafi 's government but abstained in the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> vote on a second resolution that authorised military intervention .
It has accused the Western coalition conducting air strikes of going beyond its mandate to protect civilians .
Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's four - decade rule control the east of Libya from their stronghold in Benghazi , the western city of Misrata and the mountains near the border with Tunisia .
They have been unable to advance on Tripoli against Gaddafi 's better - equipped forces .
The Libyan capital and vicinity has come under increased attack from NATO bombing in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
In Oslo , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is not seeking the leading role in Libyan mediation and emphasised the importance of African Union efforts .
