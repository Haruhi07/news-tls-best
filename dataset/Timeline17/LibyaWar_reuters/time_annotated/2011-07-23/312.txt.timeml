TRIPOLI , Libya | Sat <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-07-23">Jul 23 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-07-23T10:52">10:52 am</TIMEX3> EDT TRIPOLI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
Libya is ready to hold more talks with the United States and with rebels trying to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , but the Libyan leader will not bow to demands he quit , a government spokesman said .
Moussa Ibrahim said Libyan officials had a ` ` productive dialogue '' with U.S. counterparts <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W28">last week</TIMEX3> in a rare meeting that followed American recognition of the rebel government that hopes to end Gaddafi 's 41 - year rule .
` ` Other meetings in the future ... will help solve Libyan problems , '' the spokesman told reporters in Tripoli late on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-07-22">Friday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are willing to talk to the Americans more . ''
He said Gaddafi would not leave his position nor Libya .
Hours later NATO planes bombed targets in the capital , causing damage and casualties , Libyan state television said , without giving details .
NATO said it had hit a ` ` command and control node . ''
A Reuters witness heard at least six blasts early on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-07-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> , the largest to hit the capital in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXW">several weeks</TIMEX3> , four of them shaking the hotel hosting international media .
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil said Gaddafi must agree publicly to stand down before any talks could begin .
` ` There are no negotiations with this regime unless he declares his departure and that he is stepping down , he and his sons , from power , '' he said in a weekly statement to Libyans broadcast on rebel - run television .
As Gaddafi clings to power despite <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement .
But the United States also says Gaddafi must go .
Ibrahim said Libyan officials - but not Gaddafi himself - would be willing to hold further meetings with rebels , who <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> control roughly half of Libya , only on the government 's terms .
` ` Nations do not negotiate with armed gangs , '' he said .
Gaddafi is urging Libyans to persuade rebels to disarm and rejoin the loyal fold -- and to fight them if they do n't .
His comments came as Libya reported a NATO airstrike near the eastern oil hub of Brega , the scene of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> fighting , which the government said killed six guards at a water plant .
NATO said the strike targeted a ` ` military storage facility '' rather than the water pipeline plant .
As Western nations intensify diplomatic efforts , a European diplomat said a U.N. envoy would seek to persuade the warring parties to accept a plan that envisages a ceasefire and a power - sharing government , but with no role for Gaddafi .
The diplomat said the informal proposals would be canvassed by the special U.N. envoy to Libya , Abdul Elah al - Khatib , who has met both government and rebels several times .
Jalil , who heads the rebels ' Transitional National Council that many Western nations <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recognize as the Libyan authority , told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-07-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> that Khatib 's plan for power - sharing could be discussed as long as Gaddafi himself was out .
` ` Any diplomatic solutions are acceptable if they include this main condition , '' he said .
A rebel spokesman told Reuters that Khatib would come to their eastern stronghold of Benghazi <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W30" mod="START">early next week</TIMEX3> .
Poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi .
They declared advances <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W29">this week</TIMEX3> but they also suffered losses near their enclave of Misrata and in fighting for Brega .
Gaddafi has stepped up his defiant rhetoric amid persistent reports of talks .
Pro - government rallies are being shown almost daily on state television , perhaps a reminder to outsiders that he can still command considerable support .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07-22">Friday</TIMEX3> , thousands gathered near Tripoli 's historic center for the unveiling of a massive likeness of the longtime leader .
State television said Gaddafi would make another speech on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-07-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> , this time addressed to Egyptians on the anniversary of their revolution -- not <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> 's , which toppled President Hosni Mubarak , but pan - Arabist Gamal Abdel - Nasser 's in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> .
Nasser was a role model for Gaddafi who seized power in a coup as a young revolutionary .
Spokesman Ibrahim denied a rebel report that Mansour Daw , a key aide to Gaddafi , had been wounded in a rebel rocket attack in Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-07-21">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
He said there had been an explosion but it was caused by a kitchen gas cylinder .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Let the leaders of both factions stand down and then talk to each other .
What kind of idiot says they will negotiate with the opposing faction as soon as they leave power ?
` ` As Gaddafi clings to power despite <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P5M">five months</TIMEX3> of civil war and a NATO bombing campaign authorized by a U.N. resolution , the West is increasingly hoping for a negotiated settlement ...
But the United States also says Gaddafi must go . ''
The civil war was created out of whole cloth by NATO 's intervention , and the UN resolution authorised a no - fly zone , which is a far different thing from a bombing campaign .
As for a negotiated settlement , see above .
What kind of an idiot ...
Well , every schoolyard bragger\/bully wants to ` ` talk '' once he is finally getting his butt whipped .
Most of the time it 's a little late for that .
Everybody has willing to ` ` talk '' to Moammar for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">the past 40 years</TIMEX3> .
All he ever did was rant and rave and thumb his nose .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , the time for ` ` talking '' has passed .
This is not about ` ` fair '' .
The ` ` negotiations '' that will take place when Moammar -LRB- perhaps -RRB- announces he will step down only concern the method and manner of his exile and imprisonment and issues such as the immunity of his family from prosecution .
Of course , he can always lead his devotees to utter destruction , then put a pistol in his mouth like Hitler .
Or , he can ` ` negotiate '' .
This is all about powers - that - be who have had completely enough of Moammar and have decided , irrevocably , to relegate him to history .
Any ` ` idiocy '' would be in the assumption that the dialog surrounding this conflict is ever likely to be some kind of fair and open discussion .
It 's not a debate in sociology class , it 's the end -LRB- finally -RRB- of Moammar .
Whether or not that 's nice , or fair , or whether the above mentioned powers - that - be are being less than impartial in their application of justice is entirely irrelevant .
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
