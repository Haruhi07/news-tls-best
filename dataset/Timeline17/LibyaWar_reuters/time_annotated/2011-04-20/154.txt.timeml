The Libyan government 's reported use of cluster munitions and heavy weapons in Misrata has caused substantial civilian casualties and may amount to crimes under international law , the United Nations said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for a halt to the siege of Misrata and condemned the attacks , including a cluster bomb said to have exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-W15">last week</TIMEX3> several hundred meters from the hospital in the west Libyan city .
` ` Under international law , the deliberate targeting of medical facilities is a war crime and the deliberate targeting or reckless endangerment of civilians may also amount to serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law , '' Pillay said in a statement .
The rebels accuse forces supporting Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi of using cluster bombs .
The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-W15">last week</TIMEX3> government forces had fired the weapons into residential areas of Misrata and it had found remnants .
The Libyan government , which denies shelling civilians , has also denied this allegation .
At least two medical clinics in Misrata are reported to have been hit by mortar rounds or sniper fire , according to Pillay .
Libya 's third largest city and the insurgents ' last major stronghold in the west has been under siege for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P7W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than seven weeks</TIMEX3> .
Rebels said they fought troops for control of a main thoroughfare there <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and eight people had been killed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-04-19">the previous day</TIMEX3> , mostly civilians .
Hundreds of people are believed to have been killed in Misrata where aid workers say the humanitarian situation is worsening due to a lack of food , water and medical supplies .
` ` Using imprecise weaponry such as cluster munitions , multiple rocket launchers and mortars , and other forms of heavy weaponry , in crowded urban areas will inevitably lead to civilian casualties , '' Pillay said , adding that women and children were among the dead .
Pillay , a former U.N. war crimes judge , said pro - government forces besieging Misrata , including commanders , could be held criminally liable for their orders and acts .
The International Criminal Court -LRB-
ICC -RRB- was already investigating possible crimes .
ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo has said Libyan authorities decided they were ready to kill unarmed protesters opposed to Gaddafi 's 41 - year rule even before unrest spread from Tunisia and Egypt .
He has raised concern about abductions , torture and killings .
Pillay voiced concern about mistreatment of journalists by the Libyan authorities and said at least two journalists had been killed and 16 were missing , including 10 foreigners .
` ` Dozens of others have been detained , assaulted , physically abused -- possibly to the point of torture -- or expelled . ''
