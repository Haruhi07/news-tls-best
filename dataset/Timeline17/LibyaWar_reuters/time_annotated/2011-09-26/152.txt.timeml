Kelli Stevens , a spokeswoman for Suncor , said the company has been in contact with partner Harouge Oil Operations ` ` and we 're aware of them taking steps to restart production '' .
Stevens said Suncor is still concerned about the safety and security of its employees in Libya , and none of the expatriate employees it evacuated in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> have yet returned .
Oil production in Libya is resuming as forces of the National Transitional Council consolidate their control and sweep out Muammar Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists .
Libya 's oil industry can restart without foreign firms , but analysts say a speedy return to prewar output of 1.6 million barrels per day will depend on their return .
Suncor 's share of its exploration and production sharing agreements with Libya 's National Oil Co averaged about 35,000 bpd before civil war disrupted operations .
It picked up the fields in the Sirte Basin of Libya in its <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> acquisition of Petro - Canada .
The company wrote down the value of the operations in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> by C$ 514 million -LRB- $ 500 million -RRB- .
The book value is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about C$ 400 million .
Suncor shares were up 51 Canadian cents , or 2 percent , at C$ 26.83 by late morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
