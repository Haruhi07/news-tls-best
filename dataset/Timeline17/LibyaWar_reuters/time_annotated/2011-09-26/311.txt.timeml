Saras welcomes news , could restart own ops by year - end \ * Eni shares up 1.4 percent -LRB- Releads , adds comments from analyst , Saras chairman -RRB- MILAN , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-09-26">Sept 26</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy 's Eni has restarted oil production in Libya as the group moves to consolidate its position as the dominant foreign oil operator in the country and bolster flagging volume .
The oil and gas group said in a statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-09-26">Monday</TIMEX3> it had restarted production in 15 Libyan wells in the Abu Attifel field , some 300 kilometres south of Benghazi .
Production at the field is around 31,900 barrels of oil per day , it said .
That compares to pre - civil war daily output of around 70,000 barrels .
` ` The foreign operators already present are starting operations as fast as possible , proving their existing contracts are not at risk , '' a Milan - based oil industry specialist said .
Eni was the largest foreign oil producer in Libya before the civil war and is keen to mend relations with interim government leaders , after hesitant Italian support for the uprising in its early stages .
Some analysts have expressed concern Eni could lose assets or opportunities in the long run if Rome 's lukewarm early support for the rebels triggers a backlash .
In Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> , Eni produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
Its oil production contracts are in force until <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2042">2042</TIMEX3> and gas contracts until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2047">2047</TIMEX3> .
Eni 's adjusted net profit in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-Q2">the second quarter of this year</TIMEX3> fell 14 percent , hit by oil and gas disruption in Libya .
Eni shares closed up 1.37 percent at 12.54 euros .
Eni said on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-09-26">Monday</TIMEX3> that other wells in Abu Attifel would be reactivated in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming days</TIMEX3> to reach the volume required to fill the pipeline connecting the field to the Zuetina terminal .
` ` Things are clearly going better and faster than the pessimists thought , '' said Davide Tabarelli , head of energy think - tank Nomisma Energie .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said it would take six to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P18M">18 months</TIMEX3> to resume its oil production in Libya depending on the fields .
France 's Total said on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-09-23">Friday</TIMEX3> production at its Al - Jurf offshore field in Libya had restarted , earlier than expected .
` ` There 's a lot of potential in Libya and I believe we could be looking to go back not just to production levels before the war but to the levels of more than 3 million barrels per day we had before Gaddafi came to power , '' Tabarelli said .
Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels of oil per day before the uprising against leader Muammar Gaddafi began in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> .
The civil war caused foreign workers to flee and some oilfields and export terminals were damaged .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Last Thursday</TIMEX3> , a senior source in the National Oil Corporation told Reuters that Libya 's oil production is set to reach 500,000 barrels per day by <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-10" mod="START">early October</TIMEX3> .
Italian oil refiner Saras welcomed the news of Eni 's production resumption , and said it hoped to restart crude shipment operations with Libya before the end of the year .
Before the Libyan conflict began Saras sourced about 35 percent of its crude shipments from Libya .
Light sweet crude , easier to refine than other types and so difficult to replace , accounted for around 25 percent of Saras ' Libyan shipments .
Half of this came from the Abu Attifel field .
