The United States reacted cautiously on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-11">Monday</TIMEX3> to a peace plan for Libya rejected by the rebels , saying it was waiting for details and shedding no light on whether the proposal required Muammar Gaddafi to step down .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeated the U.S. view that the Libyan leader , embroiled in a civil war against rebels seeking to overthrow him , must leave power and the country
but she did not include this on a list of ` ` non - negotiable '' demands .
While a State Department official said the omission was not intentional , it suggested Clinton might be trying to leave some negotiating room to keep alive the African Union peace plan despite its rejection by the Benghazi - based opposition .
It is unclear how the conflict may end given the apparent stalemate between Gaddafi 's forces and the rebels , who are being assisted by NATO air power .
President Barack Obama , seeking to extricate U.S. troops from long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has ruled out sending U.S. ground forces to Libya , a North African oil exporter which the United States long accused of sponsoring terrorism .
The rebels said there could be no deal to end the two - month - old civil war unless Gaddafi , who has ruled the country for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than four decades</TIMEX3> , left power .
Earlier , South African President Jacob Zuma , head of an AU delegation , said Gaddafi had accepted the plan , including a ceasefire proposal .
Clinton largely sidestepped a question at a news conference about the U.S. view of the peace plan , saying she had received accounts of the proposal and how it was received by both sides but said she was waiting to get ` ` a full readout . ''
She did not directly address a query on whether the proposal required that Gaddafi step down .
` ` We have made it very clear that we want to see a ceasefire .
We want to see the Libyan regime forces pull back from the areas that they have forcibly entered .
We want to see a resumption of water , electricity and other services to cities that have been brutalized by the Gaddafi forces .
We want to see humanitarian assistance reach the people of Libya .
These terms are non - negotiable , '' Clinton told reporters .
` ` We believe , too , that there needs to be a transition that reflects the will of the Libyan people and the departure of Gaddafi from power and from Libya , '' she added during a news conference with Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb .
A State Department official said her choice not to put Gaddafi 's departure among the non - negotiable terms was not deliberate .
It ` ` was not intentional .
Our position remains that Gaddafi has to go , '' said the official , who spoke on condition that he not be identified .
