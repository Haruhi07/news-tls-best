MISRATA , Libya | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Jul 18 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-07-18T18:34">6:34 pm</TIMEX3> EDT MISRATA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebel forces have routed most of Muammar Gaddafi 's troops in the Libyan oil town of Brega in the biggest boost of their campaign in weeks , spokesmen said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The government denied the claim .
More than 40 people on both sides were reported killed in fighting over the city since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W28" mod="END">late last week</TIMEX3> .
The rebels have encircled Brega , an oil export terminal with a refinery which for months marked the eastern limit of Gaddafi 's control , said spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah .
But its streets were strewn with landmines , making it hard to secure full control of the area .
` ` The main body -LRB- of Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- retreated to Ras Lanuf , '' which lies to the west , he said by telephone from the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi .
However , government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said that , ` ` our brave soldiers and volunteer soldiers are in Brega in their thousands and control it completely . ''
` ` NATO and the rebels have tried to attack Brega for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P5D">the last five days</TIMEX3> , '' he told foreign journalists in the capital Tripoli .
` ` The only way for them to control Brega is to attack it with nuclear bombs . ''
He said the government had lost 30 soldiers <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P5D" mod="MORE_THAN">over five days</TIMEX3> of fighting , but rebels had lost many times more .
Abdulmolah said 12 rebels were killed and some 300 wounded on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Most rebel forces were <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> past Brega and heading west toward the towns of Bishr and Ugayla , he said .
While rebel fighters have been making gains in eastern and western Libya in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> , Russia criticized the United States and other countries for recognizing the rebel leadership as the legitimate government of Libya , saying they were taking sides in the insurgents ' five - month - old war to oust Gaddafi .
` ` Those who declare recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced U.S. recognition of the rebels on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> , a major diplomatic step that could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds .
Russia and China have taken a softer line toward Libyan leader Gaddafi , and neither attended an international meeting on the conflict in Turkey on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Brega , about 750 km -LRB- 465 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , has a strategic oil terminal .
The attack could signal a new rebel push westwards after weeks of stalemate .
It has changed hands several times in the back - and - forth fighting along Libya 's Mediterranean coast since the rebellion began in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> .
Libyan TV , in a bid to counter the rebel claims , showed what it said was footage taken on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> in Brega .
Students were shown taking an exam , and there were pictures of the port , oil terminal and a worker at a natural gas plant in the city .
Rebels say taking Brega will this time be a tipping point in the conflict on the eastern front .
` ` It is going to take the revolutionaries <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P10D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 10 days</TIMEX3> to claim full control of Brega , '' said rebel spokesman Abdelsalam in Misrata .
Gaddafi is refusing to step down despite the five - month - old rebellion against his rule , a campaign of NATO air strikes , and the defections of members of his inner circle .
The slow progress of the rebel military campaign has caused strains within NATO , some member states pressing for a negotiated solution to hasten the end of a conflict some thought would last only <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PXW">a few weeks</TIMEX3> .
Reports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis , but on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-07-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> he called the rebels worthless traitors and rejected the idea he was about to leave the country .
NATO said it had on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> struck an antenna radar system , which was being used for military purposes at Tripoli 's main airport .
Naji Daw , acting director of civil aviation at the airport , told journalists the target had purely civilian use .
NATO warplanes have also been attacking pro - Gaddafi forces near Brega .
The alliance said targets hit on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> included one tank , five armored fighting vehicles and two rocket launchers .
On another front , in the Western Mountains region southwest of Tripoli , pro - Gaddafi forces exchanged artillery fire on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-07-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> with rebels in the village of Al - Qawalish , a rebel fighter manning a checkpoint there told Reuters .
A rebel spokesman in the regional town of Zintan said rebels had repelled a bid by Gaddafi troops to enter the town .
