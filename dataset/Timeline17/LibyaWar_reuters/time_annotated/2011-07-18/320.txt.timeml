MOSCOW -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Russia criticised on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-07-18">Monday</TIMEX3> the United States and other countries that have recognized the rebel National Transitional Council as Libya 's legitimate government , saying they were taking sides in the civil war .
Setting Russia apart from the West , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said nations that recognized the rebel National Transition Council -LRB-
TNC -RRB- were pursuing a ` ` policy of isolation '' he suggested could undermine efforts to end the five - month war .
` ` Those who declare such recognition stand fully on the side of one political force in a civil war , '' Lavrov said .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the recognition at a meeting in Turkey on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-07-15">Friday</TIMEX3> of an international contact group on Libya , which is seeking a political solution that would remove Muammar Gaddafi from power .
The major diplomatic step could unblock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds .
Russia , which in the past has warned the contact group not to try to eclipse the authority of the U.N. Security Council , was invited to the meeting for the first time along with China , but both decided not to get involved .
Russia has also said Gaddafi must go , but has criticised the Western bombing campaign and urged talks between rebels and the government .
Lavrov suggested that recognizing the rebel council as Libya 's sole legitimate government would not help .
` ` Supporters of such a decision are supporters of a policy of isolation , in this case the isolation of those forces that represent Tripoli , '' said Lavrov , adding that Moscow is in contact with both Tripoli and the rebels .
` ` We ... reject isolation as a method of solving problems and support inclusion , '' Lavrov said .
He said the sides should ` ` show responsibility for the fate of the people and the country and sit at the negotiating table '' for a ` ` focused , very concrete dialogue about the conditions under which transitional structures could be formed . ''
Those structures would prepare for reforms , legislative changes and ` ` free and democratic elections , '' he said .
Russia , which has veto power and a permanent U.N. Security Council member , abstained from voting on the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> resolution that authorised the Western force in Libya but has accused the NATO nations involved of overstepping their mandate .
