MILAN | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-23">Aug 23 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-08-23T24:17">12:17 pm</TIMEX3> EDT MILAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Eni , the biggest foreign oil producer in Libya before the civil war , could lose assets or opportunities in the long run if Italy 's hesitant support for the rebel government early in the conflict leads to a backlash .
The rebels , who are close to winning a six - month war against Muammar Gaddafi , have already said firms from Russia and China could fall out of favor for the lack of support for the uprising , thus opening the doors to companies from Britain , France and the United States to gain more assets .
` ` In the short - to - mid term I see no risk for Eni .
Any new government will need cash and that means getting production onstream fast .
To do that they 'll need Eni , '' said Stefano Casertano , senior fellow at German think - tank BIGS - Potsdam .
` ` We 'll see further on if there 's a diplomatic - type attack for access to what Eni controls , '' he added .
While Italy hesitated , Britain , France and the U.S. led the early drive for intervention in Libya to protect the rebels .
Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi , long Gaddafi 's closest European ally , was silent in the initial days of the uprising in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> , and his government 's calls for Gaddafi to step down were much more subdued than those of European peers .
Berlusconi has also said he was against NATO intervention in Libya but was forced to go along with it .
His main coalition partner , the Northern League , has long opposed intervention .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni called on Europe to abandon sanctions against Libya in an attempt to rebuild bridges when Gaddafi had seemed to be regaining control of the country .
A diplomatic source in Rome told Reuters <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-07">last month</TIMEX3> Italy 's initially subdued condemnation of Gaddafi followed by an abrupt switch in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> to fully back the rebels had damaged its credibility and could prove costly in the long run .
Italy has <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> moved fast to seize back the initiative .
Berlusconi said he will meet Libyan rebel leader Mahmoud Jibril , and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Eni staff were in Libya to try to restart oil facilities , adding , ` ` It is clear Eni will play a No . 1 role in the future . ''
France 's Total is an active player in Libya .
Britain 's BP has assets there but no production , as does Royal Dutch Shell .
U.S. groups Marathon Oil Corp and ConocoPhillips are also active .
Gaddafi 's fall could give new players such as Qatar 's national oil company and trading house Vitol opportunities .
Qatar was quick to establish links with Libyan rebels and was the first Arab country to give planes to police no - fly zones .
` ` There is obviously some benefit to the countries that helped the Libyans in the crisis , but that advantage can go quite quickly .
So British companies and French companies would want to get there as quickly as possible , '' Gavin De Salis , chairman of oil services firm OPS International , told Reuters Insider .
Eni , in Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3> , produced about 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
Its oil production contracts are in force to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2042">2042</TIMEX3> and gas contracts to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2047">2047</TIMEX3> .
` ` Eni getting production restarted fast would win it good will with any new government in Libya , '' said Justin Jacobs , oil and gas analyst at Business Monitor International .
Eni has said that if stability returns , it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> to restart oil production and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> for gas .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-08-23">Tuesday</TIMEX3> the Libyan rebel envoy to Italy said he expected Italian contracts to be respected in a post - Gaddafi era .
Russia and China opposed tough sanctions on Gaddafi , and some say energy companies there could feel a backlash .
` ` We do n't have a problem with Western countries like Italians , French and UK companies .
But we may have some political issues with Russia , China and Brazil , '' said Abdeljalil Mayouf , information head at Libyan rebel oil firm AGOCO .
Russian companies , including oil firms Gazprom Neft and Tatneft , had projects worth billions of dollars in Libya before the conflict started .
China , which took 3 percent of its imported crude from Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> , had about 75 companies operating there .
` ` The Chinese and Russians were reticent to step in and play an active pro - rebel role .
Certainly European and U.S. companies stand to benefit from that , '' said Jacobs .
Before the war , Gazprom Neft agreed to buy a stake from Eni in Libya 's Elephant field , but that has been put on hold .
Eni is a strategic partner of Gazprom .
Going forward , much will depend on what a future rebel government will look like and where its sympathies lie .
` ` The big question is who the rebels are .
I do n't think we ' ve seen the real leadership yet , which will probably be made up of new figures , '' said Karim Mezran , professor for Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Bologna .
` ` And another big issue is unfreezing Libyan assets .
How the European countries handle that one could give them leverage for their own oil companies . ''
Libyan investors own some 7.5 percent of Italy 's biggest bank , UniCredit , around 1 percent of Eni and some 2 percent of aerospace and defense group Finmeccanica -LRB-
