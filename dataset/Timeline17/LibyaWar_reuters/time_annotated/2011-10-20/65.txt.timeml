TRIPOLI | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-10-20">Oct 20 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2011-10-20T19:15">7:15 pm</TIMEX3> EDT TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - NATO is to formally decide on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-10-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> whether to end its mission over Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that Muammar Gaddafi is dead and buried and the country 's new leaders have declared the nation ` ` liberated '' .
The likely decision to end the alliance 's patrols over the skies of Libya at the end of the month marks another milestone in what the National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- has pledged will be a road toward democracy and free and fair elections in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
But the deaths of Gaddafi and his son Mo ` tassim after both were captured wounded but alive on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-10-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> and the grisly public display of their decomposing bodies in a Misrata meat locker have made the NTC 's Western backers uneasy about Libya 's prospects for stable government and respect for the rule of law .
Gaddafi and Mo ` tassim were buried in a secret desert location on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-10-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to prevent their graves becoming a shrine for any remaining followers in the oil - rich North African state .
Under pressure from Western allies , the NTC promised on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-10-17">Monday</TIMEX3> to investigate how Gaddafi and his son were killed .
Mobile phone footage shows both alive after their capture .
The former leader was seen being mocked , beaten and abused before he died , in what NTC officials say was crossfire .
The treatment of others who supported Gaddafi and fought alongside him was <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> an issue , said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman .
` ` This is a test .
The NTC has repeatedly said that they will distinguish themselves from the Gaddafi regime in terms of the respect of human rights and the rule of law , '' he told a news conference in Morocco .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> is the time for them to begin actions that will help them reinforce these words . ''
Emerging from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> of often brutal one - man rule , many Libyans are savoring the end of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight months</TIMEX3> of bitter civil war won with NATO 's backing and are unconcerned about how Gaddafi met his end and how his body was treated afterwards .
` ` Throw him in a hole , in the sea , in garbage .
He is lower than a donkey or a dog and only foreigners say they care about how we killed him .
And they are lying , '' said engineer Ali Azzarog , 47 .
Hatred of Gaddafi unified his disparate opponents , who will likely <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> tussle for power during a planned transition to democracy in a nation riven with regional and tribal rivalries .
With economic problems at home , NATO countries are expected to endorse an end to their U.N.-mandated mission in Libya when their ambassadors meet in Brussels on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-10-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after a preliminary decision <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W41">last week</TIMEX3> to end it on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-10-31">October 31</TIMEX3> .
` ` We said that we would consult closely with the United Nations and the NTC and that process of consultations is ongoing , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said .
Libyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said he wanted NATO to maintain its mission for another month , but hoped for a swift end to United Nations sanctions to free up funds for the interim government to pay salaries and help reconstruction .
NATO spokeswoman Lungescu declined to say whether NATO might extend the mission .
` ` I do n't know whether there is a formal request .
All these things remain to be sorted out .
But in the end this is a political decision , '' she said .
NATO 's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy , James Appathurai , said he expected the alliance to confirm its decision to end the mission .
` ` I do n't expect that there will be a change to that decision , because it is quite clear that the pro - Gaddafi elements no longer have the command and control or other capabilities to pose an organized threat to civilians .
That is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> finished , and as a result our operation will end , '' he said .
Western military powers have already begun winding down the Libyan mission , and diplomats have said the majority of NATO equipment , including fighter jets , has already been withdrawn .
A NATO statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-10-18">Tuesday</TIMEX3> said operations in the interim would involve intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , although NATO would retain the capability to conduct air strikes if they were needed .
The one remaining element from the old order is Gaddafi 's sons , the enigmatic Saif al - Islam , who remains on the run .
Once viewed as a moderate reformer , he vowed to help his father crush his enemies once the revolt began .
An NTC official said Saif al - Islam was in the southern desert near Niger and Algeria and was set to flee Libya using a false passport .

When they got married they got a certain amount of money .
So they were rather the envy of many other citizens of African countries .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , of course , since NATO s humanitarian intervention the infrastructure of their country has been bombed back to the Stone Age .
They will not have the same quality of life .
Women probably will not have the same degree of emancipation under any new transitional government .
The national wealth is probably going to be siphoned off by Western corporations .
Perhaps the standard of living in Libya might have been slightly higher than it perhaps is <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in America and the UK with the recession , she said .
What really was the UN&NATO trying to achieve ?
so in order to protect civiians they have overturned Gaddafi in favor of thr MUslim Brotherhood .
So Libya = Egypt .
It is about time .
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , will the NTC show that they are more of a nation or a bunch of outlaws .
Try this person in the courts .
If found guilty , punish him as a man .
Let him die a humiliated dictaor .
Feed him as he fed a dog .
But , if found innocent ... well , lets just see our humanity , then .
