BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Apr 24 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-04-24T19:02">7:02 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi bombarded Misrata on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after rebels celebrated the pullback of government troops from the western Libyan city , a rebel spokesman said .
` ` The situation is very dangerous , '' rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said by telephone from Misrata .
` ` Gaddafi 's brigades started random bombardment in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2011-04-24TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> .
The bombardment is still going on . ''
Captured government troops said on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-04-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> they had been ordered to retreat from Misrata -- the only major rebel - held city in western Libya -- after a siege of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly two months</TIMEX3> , and rebels fighting to overthrow Gaddafi had claimed victory .

But the mood of victory was short - lived and the prospect of a turning point in the two - month conflict dimmed on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Government forces bombarded three residential areas and the city center , including Tripoli Street , the thoroughfare that has been the scene of intense fighting in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , Abdelsalam said .
Rebel spokesman Safieddin said a large part of Tripoli Street was under the control of rebels , and that insurgents had launched an attack on the remaining Gaddafi forces after NATO air strikes on the city in the early hours .
Rebels have so far been unable to advance from eastern Libya as they fight with Gaddafi 's troops on the coastal road between the towns of Ajdabiyah and Brega , outgunned and lacking cash for equipment and state - building .
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told a news conference in Kuwait on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> that the oil state would contribute 50 million Kuwaiti dinar -LRB- $ 177 million -RRB- to Libya 's rebel council .
Fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar , which has joined the Western military operations in Libya , has been marketing Libyan oil on behalf of the rebels to help them generate income .
An arms embargo on Libya is being enforced by NATO , but the rebels also need money to try to create the infrastructure of a state from scratch and care for victims of the conflict as they pursue their two - month - old battle to shake off Gaddafi 's rule .
` ` This amount will help us a lot in paying the salaries of employees who did not receive their little salaries for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> , '' Abdel Jalil said .
` ` We are capable of only covering 40 percent of this amount .
We are in need of urgent aid . ''
Hundreds have been killed in the fighting for Misrata , raising fears of a humanitarian crisis in the besieged city .
Safieddin said at least 36 people had been killed there by Gaddafi 's forces since <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-04-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> : eight during <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-04-24">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's bombardment and 28 on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-04-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> , many killed by booby - traps left behind by retreating forces .
More than 100 had been wounded .
A Qatari ship docked at the Tunisian port of Sousse overnight carrying 127 Libyans and 11 Tunisians from Misrata , the Tunisian state news agency said .
Rebels in their eastern stronghold Benghazi said they had no expectations of an early end to fighting in Misrata .
` ` I do n't think this is a real withdrawal , '' rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani told Reuters .
He said government loyalists might be trying to stoke tensions between Misrata and neighboring towns , and that Gaddafi 's troops might return to the city later under the guise of intervening to protect local tribes from the rebels .
Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim had said the army would ` ` leave it to the tribes and the people around Misrata to deal with the situation , whether by using force or using negotiations . ''
British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC he doubted Gaddafi 's forces were really going to withdraw .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-05">This may</TIMEX3> be cover for using more insurgent - type warfare without any uniforms and without tanks . ''
Britain and France have been leading air strikes against Gaddafi 's forces in an operation mandated by the U.N. Security Council on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2011-03-17">March 17</TIMEX3> to protect civilians in Libya .
The United States has also deployed Predator drones , using the unmanned plane for the first time on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2011-04-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> to attack the site of a multiple rocket launcher near Misrata .
Libyan state news agency Jana quoted a military source as saying the use of drones was aimed at political assassination .
Western powers have been bombing Libyan positions for <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> .

The United States , Britain and France say they will not stop their air war until Gaddafi leaves power .
JANA said on <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2011-04-23">Saturday</TIMEX3> that Prime Minister al - Baghdadi Ali al - Mahmoudi had spoken by telephone to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou .
While speaking with Papandreou he ` ` reiterated Libya 's commitment to United Nations resolutions , '' JANA said .
The Libyan government has repeatedly announced ceasefires , but failed to halt military operations .

The Libyans are will to sacrifice all to gain their freedom .
A good article about it can be found at This is a war between a corrupt r gime -- which , however , unlike most corrupt r gimes in the world is not a puppet of and entirely subservient to the West -- on one side , and a bunch of CIA\/MI6\/DGSE - backed opportunists on the other who rely on a passionately gullible educated Libyan minority and social\/tribal divides -LRB- plus an element of anti - sub - Saharan racism -RRB- to sell themselves as freedom fighters .
The majority of Libyans would choose peace over democracy any day , but the West has made sure to transform an externally - orchestrated protest into an all - out civil war in order to take control of North Africa and drive out China and bring about the New Order .
Naturally , as the civil war goes on , lives will be disrupted and people killed and others radicalized , and reconciliation becomes impossible , which is just what the West and the opportunist rebel leaders want -LRB- and the r gime was trying to avoid -RRB- .
If the West truly cared about the civilian population of Libya , far from engineering and taking sides in a civil war , they should n't have orchestrated\/supported the uprising in the first place , and the majority of the civilians in Libya would <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be living a normal -LRB- and highly subsidized -RRB- life , just as they were doing <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few months ago</TIMEX3> -LRB- while a powerful lite would continue to make huge profits from shady deals at the expense of the masses , which is also the case in Western ` ` democracies '' by the way -RRB- .
With Republicans , we hear of national security and rogue states and the war on terror ; with Democrats , humanitarian crises and ` ` democratic '' oppositions\/freedom fighters conveniently pop up around the world and get saturation coverage .
The public explanations change ; the principle of imperialist interventionism does n't .
Western mass media are the cheerleaders of Western imperialism .
When Libya 's citizens -LRB- we call them rebels -RRB- say ` ` free '' they mean they have freedom of movement within the city .
Gaddafi soldiers & mercenaries only moved to the outskirts of the city and are pounding the city indiscriminately with long range Grad Rockets .
Gaddafi also laid mines or booby - traps explosives before pulling out , which leaves children playing in huge danger .
This megalomaniac wants to butcher every man , women and child and never give up until he is dead himself .
The West has n't realized that until <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
They thought he would just resign .
LOL the guy is a psycho , we should have know that when he killed some 300 Americans on flight Pam Am <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> back .
The rebels will win because that 's their country and their home .
Hiring BelarousRussians and Chad mercenaries is a pretty sad state of affairs to kill you own citizens and has poisoned their drinking water .
I hope we will help all we can , and be for once on the right side of history , especially when we are begged to do so by its citizens .
