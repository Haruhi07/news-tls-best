Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to fallen Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi committed a vast array of possible war crimes while battling rebels in Misrata , the country 's third largest city , according to a report issued on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-08-30">Tuesday</TIMEX3> by a U.S.-based human rights group .
The report by Physicians for Human Rights , titled ` ` Witness to War Crimes : Evidence from Misrata , Libya , '' is based on interviews of residents in the Misrata area conducted in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> .
The authors say they provide evidence of ` ` murder , torture , rape , forced internment , and disappearance . ''
The group says Libya 's National Transitional Council must <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> move to prosecute people suspected of committing those crimes .

A popular uprising in Libya in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> against Gaddafi 's 42 - year - old rule resulted in a civil war with rebels backed by a NATO bombing campaign from the air starting in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> .
Misrata was liberated by rebels in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-05">May</TIMEX3> after a fierce three - month battle , and they <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> control most of the country .
` ` The abuses that we gathered evidence of in Misrata are some of the most egregious war crimes and crimes against humanity I ' ve heard of in Libya , '' said Richard Sollom , deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights and author of the report .
` ` There has been some evidence of crimes committed by rebel forces , but certainly nothing anywhere near as widespread and systematic as those committed by Gaddafi 's forces . ''
A single act can be deemed a war crime , but when troops commit ` ` systematic and widespread '' crimes against civilians , that is a crime against humanity , Sollom said .
As evidence of one such crime , the report includes a copy of a government order for troops to prevent fuel and supplies reaching the city of some 400,000 to 500,000 people .
The crimes detailed in the report are also consistent with what residents told Reuters reporters in Misrata during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> and with video evidence provide by a member of the new city council 's media committee .
For the report , the group focused on Misrata plus two towns immediately to the south of the city -- Kerzaz and Tomina -- which Sollom said were used as bases for Gaddafi loyalists during the government 's bombardment of the city .
People interviewed for the report cited cases of torture , summary executions and allegations that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians , hospitals and mosques .
The report mentions the case of Mohammed , a civilian resident of the town of Kerzaz , who was left blind in one eye and suffered a broken jaw that he said he sustained while being tortured by government soldiers .
Video footage provided to Reuters shows at least one apparent rocket attack on a hospital , in which a room full of incubators for premature infants was hit .
Rebel fighters also showed a team of Reuters reporters in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> a mosque on Misrata 's western front in the town of Dafniya , which they said had been targeted by Gaddafi loyalists .
There were holes caused by tank and rocket fire on the west side of the mosque 's minaret -- indicating that government troops had inflicted the damage .
And in interviews residents of Misrata told Reuters in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-07">July</TIMEX3> that Gaddafi loyalists targeted civilians .
` ` Gaddafi 's aim here was to kill as many people as he had to in Misrata in order to stay in power , '' said Fauzi al - Karshaine , a local businessman who was shot five time by Gaddafi troops on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-02-19">February 19</TIMEX3> during a protest for greater freedoms by unarmed people in Misrata .
` ` He does not care how many innocent women and children he has to kill to do it . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-06">June</TIMEX3> the International Criminal Court issued indictments against Gaddafi , his son and heir apparent Saif al - Islam and Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah al - Senussi .
Physicians for Human Rights recommends that to move forward , post - Gaddafi Libya must come to terms with its past and prosecute individuals suspected of having committed war crimes during the country 's internecine conflict .
` ` The -LRB- ruling rebel -RRB-
National Transitional Council has been saying the right things about moving forward and prosecuting war crimes , '' Sollom said .
` ` But eventually Libya will have to deal with its past and hold individual perpetrators accountable . ''
