Libyan rebel fighters sit on a ridge near a tank shell after overrunning a government army position in the village of Hawamid in western Libya , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-07-30">July 30 , 2011</TIMEX3> .
BENGHAZI , Libya | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-07-31">Jul 31 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-07-31T12:41">12:41 am</TIMEX3> BST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels say the gunmen who shot dead their military chief were militiamen allied in their struggle to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi , raising questions about divisions and lawlessness within rebel ranks .
The assassination of Abdel Fattah Younes , apparently by his own side , has hurt the opposition just as it was winning broader international recognition and launching an offensive against Gaddafi 's forces in the Western Mountains .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> of confusion , rebel minister Ali Tarhouni said Younes had been killed by fighters who were sent to fetch him from the front and his bullet - riddled and partially burnt body was found at a ranch near the rebel capital of Benghazi .
Tarhouni said late on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-07-29">Friday</TIMEX3> a militiaman had been arrested and confessed that his subordinates had carried out the killing .
Younes had been part of Gaddafi 's inner circle since the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> coup that brought the Libyan colonel to power and was interior minister before defecting to the rebels in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> .
Many rebels had been uncomfortable working under a man who had been so close to Gaddafi for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3> , and rebel sources said on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> Younes had been recalled over suspicions he or his family were secretly in contact with the Libyan leader .
Rebels were divided over who had killed Younes , some suspecting his execution was ordered by rebel leaders for treason , many believing he was killed by Gaddafi supporters who had infiltrated rebel ranks , and still others suggesting a rebel splinter group had acted alone .
Gaddafi 's government pointed the finger at Fawzi Bu Kitf , head of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , a federation of armed rebel groups operating in the east of the country .
In an apparent effort to distance himself from the killing , Bu Kitf on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-07-30">Saturday</TIMEX3> named the key suspect as Mustafa al - Rubh , the field commander who had been dispatched to arrest Younes .
` ` He is a member of the Union as an individual , '' Bu Kitf told reporters .
` ` Whatever was done was done through his own idea . ''
Whatever the truth , the killing deepens concerns among the rebels ' Western backers , keen to see them prevail in a five - month - old civil war but frustrated by their lack of unity and nervous about the influence of Islamists .
The United States , which like some 30 other nations has formally recognized the opposition , called for solidarity .
` ` What 's important is that they work both diligently and transparently to ensure the unity of the Libyan opposition , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington .
Rebels who rose up against Gaddafi in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> have seized swathes of the country but remain poorly equipped and are still far from ousting him , despite support from NATO airstrikes .
Rebels said on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-07-30">Saturday</TIMEX3> they had encircled Gaddafi 's last stronghold in the Western Mountains and hoped to seize it soon .
Rebel tanks fired at Tiji , where some 500 government troops are stationed .
` ` We have Tiji surrounded and we hope to take it by the end of the day , '' rebel commander Nasir al - Hamdi , a former police colonel , told Reuters as gunfire crackled in the distance .
Rebels also made a new push on the front just west of the rebel - held city of Misrata .
Hospital sources said 12 rebels were killed and 60 wounded in fighting that rebels said took them to the edge of Zlitan , the largest city between Misrata and the capital Tripoli to the west .
` ` Most of the casualties <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-07-31">today</TIMEX3> were from GRAD missiles and mortar fire .
We have advanced well and God willing we will be in Zlitan soon , '' said Ibrhaim Buwathi , 24 .
NATO strikes also continued in western Libya overnight .
NATO said early on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-07-30">Saturday</TIMEX3> it had bombed three satellite dishes in Tripoli to stop ` ` terror broadcasts '' by Gaddafi , but Libyan state TV remained on air and condemned what it said was the targeting of journalists .
As Libya 's civil war grinds on into Ramadan with no end in sight , Libyans on both sides of the conflict say shortages , high prices , rising <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">summer</TIMEX3> temperatures and worry about loved ones fighting on distant fronts could mar the Muslim fasting month .
` ` Ramadan will be very tough for us .
We 're already struggling <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
The weather will be very hot and we wo n't have the energy to fight while we are fasting , '' said Abdelbadr Adel , 19 , a rebel fighting in the Western Mountains .
In the east , confusion reigned over who had killed Younes .
Rebel fighters said members of the <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">February 17</TIMEX3> Martyrs ' Brigade , a rebel group that is part of the Union of Revolutionary Forces , had collected Younes from the frontline near Brega on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-07-28">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
However , Tarhouni , the rebel minister , said it was another militia , the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade , who had killed Younes .
Locals said the Obaida Ibn Jarrah Brigade mainly comprised former prisoners of Gaddafi 's notorious Abu Salim prison in the capital Tripoli , who had always distrusted Younes .
Obaid Ibn Jarrah Brigade was not a member of the Union , which is employed by the Transitional National Council for security .
Named after one of the companions of Islam 's Prophet Mohammad , the group is likely to have Islamist leanings .
One rebel commander , who asked not to be named , said Islamists whom Younes had targeted as interior minister may have killed him in retaliation .
` ` Some of those Islamists are <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> fighting with the rebels and they have always refused to fight under Younes 's command and have always viewed him with suspicion , '' he said .
` ` I do n't think the investigation will lead anywhere .
They do n't dare to touch the Islamists . ''
Further complicating an already murky situation , some Libyans said they feared that Younes ' death would trigger a bloody tribal feud .
But in an apparent effort to calm nerves , a rebel source said Younes could be replaced by Suleiman Mahmoud al - Obeidi , a member of the same tribe .
The longer the war drags on , the further eastern Libya appears to slip into lawlessness , raising questions about what kind of Libya could emerge if Gaddafi goes .
Tarhouni told reporters on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="TIME" value="2011-07-29TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> a gang had attacked a prison using rocket - propelled grenades , helping about 300 former Gaddafi soldiers and loyalists to escape .
