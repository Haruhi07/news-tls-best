Reuters -RRB- - Jamal al - Farisi 's brother was killed by a fighter loyal to Muammar Gaddafi , but he shows no hatred or desire for retribution , an attitude that contradicts the bitterness that defines many civil wars .
In Libya 's rebel - held east , there is a conspicuous lack of the deep and fractious animosities that fuelled internal conflicts in Iraq , Northern Ireland , Rwanda , Libya 's neighbor Algeria and elsewhere .
Almost all invective is aimed at just one man : Gaddafi .
` ` Who do I hate ?
I do n't want Libyan soldiers prosecuted .
You 're a soldier and you have to follow orders , '' said Farisi , whose brother Fathi was killed in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> at the beginning of the uprising against Gaddafi 's absolute rule .
In east Libya at least , evidence of the brutality that has marked most <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> civil conflicts -- in particular dumped bodies bearing signs of torture and mutilation -- is hard to find .
One reason cited by people in Benghazi , the rebel capital , is Libya 's homogeneity .
Virtually all Libyans are Arab Sunni Muslims , unlike Iraq , for example , where in the years following the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> U.S. invasion , extreme violence fed on divisions between Sunnis , Shi'ites , Kurds and Christians .
The main fault lines seen in Libyan society are tribal .
Gaddafi has manipulated the country 's tribal structures through patronage of some tribes and intimidation of others , to consolidate power .
Some analysts see tribal strife further destabilising Libya should Gaddafi fall .
The Libyan leader still controls much of the country 's west and the capital Tripoli , despite increasing pressure from NATO airstrikes .
The rebels however have been keen to disavow tribalism , and Farisi did not want tribal violence in his brother 's name .
` ` If we tried all Gaddafi 's soldiers , there would be real civil war .
Each man has a tribe behind him ...
There has to be reconciliation , '' he said .
It is difficult to tell how widespread Farisi 's views are , but his conciliatory tone is echoed by many others in the east including the rebel leadership , whose National Transitional Council on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-05-28">Saturday</TIMEX3> offered an amnesty to Gaddafi supporters who defect .
In Benghazi , the bodies of dead Gaddafi soldiers and those of rebels that fought against them are buried in the same cemetery .
They are washed according to Islamic ritual and prayers are said for all , cemetery and morgue workers said .
` ` We do n't have the custom of ` These are Gaddafi 's people , throw them over there ' .
They 're all martyrs , and they 're buried together with our martyrs , '' said grave digger Ghaith Hussein .
` ` These people were just following orders ...
Our problem is with the one who gave the orders , '' he added .
Hussein and others said those who fought the rebels may have been forced to do so , or could have been fooled by Gaddafi 's propaganda .
The Libyan leader 's autocratic rule has been brutal , and deserters risk the death penalty .
On state TV , he has labeled the rebels rats and drug - addled followers of al Qaeda .
At Benghazi 's courthouse , lawyer Breika Bitamar says she will volunteer to defend captured Gaddafi loyalists for free .
` ` Some of them may genuinely believe the rebels are al Qaeda , or that they are fighting a crusader from abroad in the form of NATO , '' she said .
` ` Some of these men think they are fighting for Libya , and anyone who dies fighting for Libya is a martyr , '' she added .
However , the magnanimity towards Libyan Gaddafi loyalists felt by some in the rebel - held east rarely extends to African mercenaries , who the rebels say Gaddafi has hired to quell the revolt against his four - decade rule .
After battles , rebels often display identity cards taken from the bodies of people from Chad , Niger , Mali , Mauritania and other African states .
Rebels who blame the actions of Gaddafi 's Libyan troops on a misunderstanding are less indulgent with the mercenaries .
But morgue worker Haroun Salem , who has handled the bodies of men accused of being mercenaries , bears them no ill will , and has washed their bodies and prayed for them at the cemetery .
` ` Sometimes we find counterfeit or out of date money in their pockets , '' he said .
` ` Gaddafi has tricked them , just like he tricked us for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3> .
God have mercy upon them . ''
