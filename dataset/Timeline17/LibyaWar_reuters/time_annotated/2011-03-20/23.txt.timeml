TRIPOLI | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Mar 20 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20T19:55">7:55 pm</TIMEX3> EDT TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Western powers pressed ahead on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> with a campaign of air attacks in Libya , promising more strikes despite criticism by the Arab League .
U.S. military officials said <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's strikes had halted an advance by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern rebel stronghold Benghazi and hit his air defenses , allowing western powers to send in planes to impose a no - fly zone .

But the day - old U.N.-mandated military intervention to force Gaddafi 's troops to end attacks on civilians hit a diplomatic setback when the Arab League chief questioned the bombardment .
` ` What is happening in Libya differs from the aim of imposing a no - fly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , '' Egypt 's state news agency quoted Arab League Secretary - General Amr Moussa as saying .
Gaddafi himself said the air strikes amounted to terrorism and vowed to fight to the death , although at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-03-19T21:00">9 p.m.</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-03-19T15:00">3 p.m.</TIMEX3> EDT -RRB- on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> an armed forces spokesman said the army was ordering all troops to cease fire immediately .

The United States and Britain , who along with France , Italy and Canada have joined operation ` ` Odyssey Dawn , '' dismissed the ceasefire announcement , arguing that Gaddafi 's government had promised and then broken a ceasefire on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">Friday</TIMEX3> .
In central Benghazi , sporadic explosions and heavy firing could be heard in the streets late in the evening .
A Reuters witness said the firing lasted <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT40M" mod="APPROX">about 40 minutes</TIMEX3> .
Residents had said they feared some of Gaddafi 's troops could try to force their way into the city , where they would be surrounded by civilians and protected from attacks from the air .
Outside Benghazi , the advance by Gaddafi 's troops was stopped in its tracks , with smoldering , shattered tanks and troop carriers littering the main road .
The charred bodies of at least 14 government soldiers lay scattered in the desert .
However , government tanks did move into Misrata , the last rebel - held city in western Libya , seeking the shelter of built - up areas after a base used by Gaddafi 's forces outside was hit by Western air strikes , residents said .
Abdelbasset , a spokesman for the rebels in Misrata , told Reuters : ` ` There is fighting between the rebels and Gaddafi 's forces .
Their tanks are in the center of Misrata ...
There are so many casualties we can not count them . ''
A Libyan government health official said 64 people had been killed in the Western bombardment overnight from <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> , but it was impossible to verify the report .
The Arab League 's Moussa called for an emergency meeting of the group of 22 states to discuss Libya .
He requested a report into the bombardment , which he said had ` ` led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians . ''
Arab backing for a no - fly zone provided crucial underpinning for the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W10">last week</TIMEX3> that paved the way for Western action to stop Gaddafi killing civilians as he fights an uprising against his rule .
The intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> invasion of Iraq .
Withdrawal of Arab support would make it much harder to pursue what some defense analysts say could in any case be a difficult , open - ended campaign with an uncertain outcome .
Britain and the United States rebuffed Moussa 's comments .
A senior U.S. official said a U.N. resolution endorsed by Arab states covered ` ` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , ` ` which we made very clear includes , but goes beyond , a no - fly zone . ''
The safe enforcement of the no - fly zone required the targeting of Libya 's air defense capabilities , a British Foreign Ministry spokesman said .
A spokesman for the rebel movement criticized Moussa 's comments , telling Al Jazeera that more than 8,000 Libyans aligned with the rebel movement had been killed .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Today</TIMEX3> , when the secretary - general spoke , I was surprised , '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said .
` ` What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya , what is the mechanism , Mr Secretary - General ?

If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation , what is the mechanism that you propose to us ? ''
The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the no - fly zone was <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in place .
But he told CBS television the endgame of military action was ` ` very uncertain '' and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi .
Mullen said he had seen no reports of civilian casualties from the Western strikes .
But Russia said there had been such casualties and called on Britain , France and the United States to halt the ` ` non - selective use of force . ''
Libyan state television showed footage from an unidentified hospital of what it called victims of the ` ` colonial enemy . ''
Ten bodies were wrapped up in white and blue bed sheets , and several people were wounded , one of them badly , the television said .
The Libyan government has denied breaking a ceasefire that it announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-03-18">Friday</TIMEX3> , blaming rebels who it says are members of al Qaeda .
The armed forces spokesman announced a new ceasefire on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> , saying that ` ` the Libyan armed forces ... have issued a command to all military units to safeguard an immediate ceasefire from <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20T21:00">9 p.m.</TIMEX3> -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20T19:00">1900
GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20TEV">this evening</TIMEX3> . ''
Both before and after he spoke , heavy anti - aircraft gunfire boomed above central Tripoli .
A senior military official said the United States expected to conduct more strikes on Libya .
` ` This is an ongoing military operation .
I fully expect more strikes , '' he said .
Britain said it was taking part in a second night of coordinated strikes and had once more launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine in the Mediterranean .
Italy said it also had planes in the air .
The United States , after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , has been reluctant to take the lead in the military operation , keen to leave this to France and Britain while also assembling a large coalition to support it .
French planes fired the first shots of the intervention on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> , destroying tanks and armored vehicles near Benghazi .
France sent an aircraft carrier toward Libya and its planes were over the country again on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-03-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> , defense officials said .
Britain said its planes had targeted Libya 's air defenses , mainly around the capital Tripoli .
U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="TIME" value="2011-03-19TNI">Saturday night</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="TIME" value="2011-03-20TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3> against air defenses around Tripoli and Misrata , U.S. officials said .
Aircraft from other countries , including Qatar , were also moving toward Libya to participate in the operation , Mullen said .

And the goal is to do what ?
Change the government -- the traditional purpose of WAR .
The excuse ` ` to protect civilians '' is a novel one .
I 'll give the imperial powers credit for that .
My guess is civilians will get killed and a civil war prolonged .
But why are Europe and the US so anxious to overturn Gadhafi after <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 40 years</TIMEX3> ?
And were they behind the rebellion to begin with ?
That was the case in Afghanistan in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> , when Carter armed and financed the rebellion that led to Russian intervention and a million deaths .
I notice that when Israeli aircraft and missiles are used against civilians in Lebanon or Gaza , I do n't see the West threatening anything at all -- no embargo , nothing to prevent Israel from flying and bombing , and surely no attack on tanks or armored vehicles used to kill civilians .
More than 20,000 civilians in many such attacks going back to <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1978">1978</TIMEX3> .
The definition of a bully is ` ` one who uses strength or power to intimidate or harm others . ''
Looks like the West , Gadhafi , and Israel have a lot in common .
As in every other tragedy and including this one , those who have had their homes and families destroyed do not care about geopolitical opinions .
Anonymous , what on earth are you talking about ?
This is a secular rebellion against a secular government !
Not everything in the Middle East is about religion , you fearmonger .
What they cheered is irrelevant ; the article did n't say , so why are you assuming that it was ` ` Allah Akbar '' -LRB-
No different than a Christian saying ` ` Thank God ! ''
, for your information -RRB- ?
I ' m sick of these Muslim - Haters commenting on news articles , spreading their irrational paranoia to others like the disease it is .
Bush is n't president anymore .
The politics of fear are over !
Get over it ; al Qaida has \ * NOTHING \ * to do with the popular rebellion in Libya , so just drop it , hatemonger !
As for whether a war is good or bad , the issue is that this was already a war well before the West got involved .
It was just a monstrously unfair war , with the side of the despot being armed with sophisticate weapons of war that the rebelling patriots just could n't stand against .
The point of establishing the no - fly zone is so that the people of Libya can fight this issue out for themselves , without one side simply wiping out the other summarily .
The forces of Gadhafi were already destroying the homes of innocent civilians , and the Western Coalition is only attacking military targets , exclusively .
War is a horrible thing when it happens , but it is part of human nature , and at times when a people are dealing with a fascist despot that will not let go of power through peaceful\/diplomatic means , then war is what is left .
I hate war more than most people , but people have to think ; if England came up with a powerful weapon that was wiping out hundreds of American Rebel Troops during the US War of Independence and they could do nothing to stand against it , would n't you have wanted Spain or some other big global power at the time to step in and stop that mega - weapon from being used , so that the war did n't turn into a genocide ?
