Analysis : Revolt in Libya likely to scar its oil sector NEW YORK | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-02-24">Feb 24 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-02-24T10:24">10:24 am</TIMEX3> EST NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- -
Regardless of what comes next in Libya 's lethal political standoff , the OPEC country 's oil sector is nearly certain to suffer , bringing long - lasting supply disruptions or even permanent damage .
None of several potential outcomes is benign for Libya 's oil industry -- the lifeblood of its economy -- or for oil prices .
The scenarios run the gamut from all - out civil war and attacks on energy infrastructure to low - level neglect and reservoir damage , as foreign expertise flees the country .
Over decades , from Iran , to Iraq and Venezuela , periods of political chaos in OPEC countries have usually carved lasting scars on the oil sector , and few expect Libya to be any different .
` ` A period of chaos will probably interrupt Libya 's refining and oil operations , '' said Amy Jaffe , an energy studies fellow and Middle East expert at Rice University in Houston .
` ` The military is abandoning Gaddafi , so it 's unclear who is left to protect oil installations .
Lots of foreigners are being evacuated , so who will remain in place capable of operating Libya 's oil industry ?
Will workers even show up ? ''
As Africa 's No . 3 producer and the site of the continent 's largest proved reserves , estimated at 44 billion barrels , Libyan oil usually accounts for 2 percent of world output .
The country , whose oil accounts for a fourth of Italy 's demand , is the first major oil exporter to be thrust into acute turmoil since protests began sweeping through the Middle East in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-01">January</TIMEX3> , unseating presidents in Tunisia and Egypt so far .
An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd of production has been halted , as companies evacuate staff and suspend operations , according to the latest Reuters calculations .
Much of the country 's oil industry is run by foreign firms including Eni and Repsol , while Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- has traditionally been tightly controlled by Gaddafi .
Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi defiantly pledged on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to stay in power at any cost , threatening to have protesters hunted down and killed ` ` house by house . ''
With rival factions already laying claim to an oil - rich swath of eastern Libya , separated by hundreds of miles of desert from capital Tripoli in the west , the country could even face civil war , analysts warned .
In OPEC countries where oil infrastructure is the ultimate key to power and purse strings , war and other major political crises have typically resulted in supply disruptions that take years or decades to bounce back from .
Iran 's <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> revolution cut the country 's output by more than half , and production never recovered fully .
Iraq 's <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> invasion of Kuwait ultimately slashed output in both countries for years , and ravaged Kuwaiti oil wells .
Venezuela 's massive oil industry strike of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> crippled production , which has never returned to pre - strike levels .
To be sure , OPEC 's top producer Saudi Arabia has stepped in to boost production in previous disruptions in other member producers , and the Saudi oil minister said on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> the cartel , led by the kingdom , stands ready to pump more oil , but only when needed .
U.S. officials say Saudi Arabia could replace Libyan supplies within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> , although it would leave less available spare capacity .
Libya 's unrest has helped push Brent crude oil prices up nearly 6 percent since <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-02-18">Friday</TIMEX3> , touching a 2 - 1\/2 - year high of nearly $ 109 a barrel , although the surge also reflects the chance that chaos will affect other oil - exporting countries .
Brent rose $ 2.64 to $ 108.42 a barrel on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` The output of -LRB- Libya 's -RRB- oil will probably not be completely halted , but it is difficult to see this level of chaos failing to result in significant operational disruptions , '' Eurasia Group analysts said in a note on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` It is likely that the country will experience a prolonged period of violent instability , with a potential for full blown civil war . ''
As the revolt aimed at ending Gaddafi 's 41 - year rule intensifies , oil infrastructure could enter the power play .
Unlike in major African exporters Nigeria and Angola where oil is mostly offshore , installations are mostly on land in Libya , making them potentially more vulnerable .
` ` This effectively gives the country two political factions , two energy - producing basins , two oil output infrastructures .
Economically at least , the seeds of protracted conflict -- regardless of what happens with Gaddafi or any political changes after he departs - have already been sown , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor .
With oil companies scrambling to pull personnel from the country , Libya 's oil industry ` ` will have to operate under difficult circumstances .
A sustained lack of security will keep foreign oil companies at bay for a while , '' said energy consultancy PFC in a note .
As yet , there are no reports of attacks on energy infrastructure , but eastern tribal leaders have threatened to shut off exports , revenue from which usually flows to capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's increasingly tenuous stronghold in the west .
Nearby , an underwater gas line to Italy has already been interrupted .
The fact that Libya is cutting exports of refined products may indicate workers are already abandoning the country 's refineries and their highly explosive plants out of fear .
A Time Magazine intelligence columnist wrote on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-02-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that Gaddafi himself may be ordering sabotage attacks on oil pipelines leading to the Mediterranean Sea , citing a source in the region .
At Libyan oil wells , which are mostly in remote desert areas , any abrupt halt could permanently damage infrastructure and compromise it for years .
` ` Anybody who feels they could still control the infrastructure in the future will probably not try to blow it up , '' said Jaffe .
` ` But companies , including the Libyan national oil company , may face a tough decision .
Will they try for orderly shutdowns that ensure production can resume easily later , or keep fields going but risk events that could damage them ? ''
