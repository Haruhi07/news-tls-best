Full Article Gaddafi 's ex - premier jailed after fleeing Libya TRIPOLI | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Sep 22 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-09-22T23:38">11:38 pm</TIMEX3> IST TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Libya 's neighbor Tunisia jailed Muammar Gaddafi 's former prime minister on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> , and Libya 's new rulers said they were tightening their grip on the desert towns where Gaddafi himself may be hiding .
In the highest profile detention of a Gaddafi associate to date , a Tunisian court sentenced ex - prime minister Al Baghdadi
Ali al - Mahmoudi to <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> in jail on charges of illegally entering the country on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2011-09-21TEV">Wednesday evening</TIMEX3> .
` ` Al - Mahmoudi was arrested <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2011-09-21TEV">yesterday evening</TIMEX3> , '' a Tunisian Interior Ministry official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters . ''
-LRB-
He -RRB- was arrested because he entered Tunisian territory illegally ...
He did not have an entry stamp in his passport . ''
The justice minister in Libya 's new government said Tripoli would request that the former prime minister be extradited to stand trial in Libya .
` ` Baghdadi directly oversaw the operations which had to do with the killings of Libyans , '' the minister , Mohammed al - Alagi , said on Al Arabiya television station .
The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , Libya 's de facto government since Gaddafi was swept from the capital <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-08">last month</TIMEX3> , has been anxious to show that it can establish firm control over a country riven by tribal and regional rivalries .
The new government said it was consolidating its grip on Sabha and other oasis towns in the far south of the country which had sided with Gaddafi .
` ` Our revolutionaries are controlling 100 percent of Sabha city , although there are some pockets of resistance by snipers , '' NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters in the capital , Tripoli .
` ` This resistance is hopeless ...
They know very well that at the end of the day they will show the white flag or they will die .
They are fighting for themselves , not for the tyrant , '' he said , referring to Gaddafi .
Until <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> some parts of Sabha , the traditional base for Gaddafi 's own tribe about 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , had been occupied by fighters loyal to him .
The council says its forces have <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> also taken control of Jufra , to the north - east of Sabha , and the nearby oasis towns of Sokna , Waddan , and Houn .
The NTC official said the manhunt for Gaddafi , in hiding for weeks though he occasionally issues defiant audio messages , was drawing closer to its target .
` ` There is no whole tribe or city on Gaddafi 's side , '' said Bani .
` ` I ' m asking everyone in the south who has any news about the tyrant or his loyalists ... to notify the legal bodies about them . ''
` ` We are doing our best looking for the tyrant .
There is some news here and there that he ran away from Sabha to another place but it can not be confirmed . ''
In Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the U.S. ambassador returned to work after a hiatus caused by the civil war , and predicted a quick end to the fighting .
` ` I think it is a matter of time -LRB- for -RRB- Gaddafi and his remaining loyalists .
Their resistance is finished , '' Ambassador Gene Cretz told reporters at a ceremony to mark the re - opening of the U.S. mission .
Libya 's interim government received a diplomatic boost when its neighbor Algeria recognized the NTC as the country 's legitimate representative , according to a report broadcast by Al Arabiya .
Algeria was the last of Libya 's neighbors to grant recognition , and the two sides have for months been trading allegations .
The NTC accused Algiers of abetting Gaddafi in the civil war , and Algeria said it was worried the new government was not firm enough on the threat from Islamist militants .
Western security officials say good relations between Libya and Algeria are vital if they are to keep a lid on al Qaeda 's north African branch , which has kidnapped foreigners and attacked Western targets in the region .
The country 's new rulers were faring less well on the battlefield , aside from advances in the far south .
In the two biggest towns where Gaddafi loyalists are still holding out , Sirte and Bani Walid , the NTC 's offensive has been chaotic , raising fresh questions about the council 's ability to run the oil exporting country effectively .
Despite support from NATO warplanes , government forces have struggled to capture Sirte , Muammar Gaddafi 's hometown and the biggest of the towns still outside their control .
It is a thorny task because the sympathies of many residents lie with Gaddafi .
The city typifies the challenges the NTC faces in reconciling the significant parts of the country that have tribal loyalties to Gaddafi or did not support the revolution .
A spokesman for Gaddafi told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> that NATO air strikes and interim government forces ' shelling of Sirte were killing civilians .
` ` Between <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-09-21">yesterday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2011-09-22TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> , 151 civilians were killed inside their homes as the Grad rockets and other explosives fell upon their heads , '' Moussa Ibrahim said in a satellite phone call to Reuters from an undisclosed location .
His claims could not be verified as journalists are unable to reach the city .
NATO comment was not immediately available .
There was a counter - claim from rebel fighters near Sirte , and from residents fleeting the city , who said that pro - Gaddafi forces had been executing people suspected of sympathising with the NTC forces .
An NTC commander on the outskirts of Sirte , who gave his name as Saleh , showed Reuters a handwritten list of families whose members were said to have been executed in Sirte .
` ` One man , they cut him like this , '' the commander said , dragging his finger from the ends of his mouth across his cheeks .
` ` Another , they cut his lips . ''
On the Western outskirts of Sirte on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-09-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> there was little fighting , and dozens of civilians poured out of the city through anti - Gaddafi checkpoints .
Over on the eastern side of the city , NTC forces came under heavy artillery fire .
One fighter there said pro - Gaddafi artillery batteries appeared to have found the range of the NTC tanks , positioned more than 50 km east of Sirte , and were targeting them .
` ` There has been heavy shelling from Gaddafi forces , '' said Adel Al - Tarhouni , an anti - Gaddafi fighter in the village of Sultana , which came under artillery attack .
` ` I was able to see palm trees cut from the top by the shrapnel . ''
North of Bani Walid , NTC military forces brought forward tanks and Grad rocket launchers in preparation for a renewed attempt to take the town .
It was not clear when that attack might begin .
Later in the day , a Reuters reporter near the town said fighting had resumed after a lull , though it did not appear to be an all - out assault .
Gaddafi loyalists were firing shells at NTC positions on the edge of the town , and plumes of smoke could be seen rising up from within Bani Walid .
The offensive there has been frustrated by stiff resistance from well - drilled loyalist fighters , and also by a lack of organization among the NTC forces .
They operate in disparate units based on their home towns , with little overall command .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-09-21">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , one fighter shot his own head off and killed another fighter while handling a rocket - propelled grenade in full view of a Reuters team .
In another incident , a fighter wounded himself and another fighter after losing control of his machinegun .
The nascent NTC national army has tried to bring order .
If the NTC is unable to swiftly assert its control over the country and its own forces , it could embarrass Western leaders , especially France 's Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain 's David Cameron , who took a gamble by backing the anti - Gaddafi leadership .
` ` We have set up a unified operations room to unite all brigades , '' said brigade commander Omar Kabout .
` ` The purpose is to increase coordination and end all this chaos because many rebels have arrived without commanders .
We need to put them into brigades and stop all this random shooting . ''
But the message was not getting through to all the fighters , many of whom go into battle wearing flip - flop sandals , T - shirts and jeans and have no military training .
` ` We do n't take orders from the NTC .
We listen only to our own commander , '' said Ziyad Al Khemri , a fighter from the town of Zawiyah , just west of Tripoli .
