The Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> and reach full volumes in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="APPROX">about a year</TIMEX3> , Ali Tarhouni , the official in charge of financial and oil matters told Reuters from Libya 's oil ministry in Tripoli .
It was the first time an official from the rebel National Transitional Authority was seen in the capital taking up the reins of government , after rebel fighters swept into the city <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-08-22">four days ago</TIMEX3> aiming to topple Muammar Gaddafi .
` ` The NOC -LRB- National Oil Corporation -RRB- initial estimate is that we can have about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels within <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .

And then we ramp this up to the normal , which is about 1.6 -LRB- million -RRB- .
My expectation is that this will be done within <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> or so , '' Tarhouni said .
Damage on most of Libya 's oilfields from the civil war has been minimal , he said .
` ` The state of the oil fields are a lot better than expected , '' he said .
` ` Overall if we want to put a number on it , the average is about 10 percent or so .
Most of the fields are more than 90 percent fine . ''
He added that Libya would continue to honor existing contracts with oil companies .
Asked if there would be any block for companies from countries that had not supported the rebels , he responded : ` ` Not that I know of . ''
` ` We have contracts with most of the major companies .
Wintershall , Shell , Repsol , Eni .
We have n't signed any new contracts .
These are pre - revolution contracts .
We are going to continue those '' .
He also said it was too early to discuss awarding any new contracts : ` ` It 's the last thing on my mind . ''
` ` We 're just going to put back things as they used to be .
The NOC is the one that is practically running the oil industry .
We will restructure that to make sure that it 's nimble . ''
Asked who will be running the oil industry for the foreseeable future until a general election , Tarhouni said : ` ` I ' m in charge until they decide to use somebody else . ''
Tarhouni , formerly a U.S.-based academic and opposition figure in exile , returned to take charge of economic , financial and oil matters on the rebels ' executive committee .
