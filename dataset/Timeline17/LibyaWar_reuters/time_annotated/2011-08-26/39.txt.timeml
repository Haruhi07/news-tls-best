Reuters -RRB- - Oil prices are likely to stay above $ 100 a barrel <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> despite increasing downward pressure from the expected return of some Libyan production and fears of a double - dip recession , a Reuters poll showed .
According to 29 analysts polled by Reuters , Brent crude prices will average $ 107.90 a barrel in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> , down from the forecast of $ 109.30 a barrel in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-07">last month</TIMEX3> 's poll .
U.S. light crude oil , also known as West Texas Intermediate -LRB- WTI -RRB- , will average $ 96.30 a barrel <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012">next year</TIMEX3> , down from a forecast of $ 99.40 a barrel <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-07">last month</TIMEX3> .
Despite doubts about how fast Libyan oil production could restart as fighting between rebels and loyalists to Muammar Gaddafi continues in Tripoli , analysts are beginning to account for some output in the medium term .
` ` The possible comeback of Libya as oil exporter after half <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> of civil war will lead to even more oil supply , '' LBBW analyst Frank Schallenberger said .
` ` On the other hand , the slowing down of the global economy will limit demand . ''
A flurry of poor economic data from the United States and Europe in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-W33">the past week</TIMEX3> has already led to a sharp correction in risk assets .
In the short - term the market will focus on a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> for hints of more quantitative easing , but U.S. investment bank Citigroup -LRB- C. N -RRB- noted <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-W34">this week</TIMEX3> that even if the United States printed more money , weak economic growth and fresh supplies from Libya would weigh on prices .
` ` If crude prices have been retreating in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> , it was not because of positive expectations on the restart of crude oil exports from Libya but on negative expectations about oil demand , '' Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said in a note .
Brent crude futures were trading above $ 110 a barrel on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2011-08-26TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> .
` ` Growth expectations are likely to be in focus , and Bernanke 's much anticipated speech is likely to play a pivotal role for near - term price direction across all asset classes , '' said Gain Capital Forex.com analyst Daniel Hwang .
The previous round of quantitative easing announced <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-08-26TMO">a year ago</TIMEX3> has led to a sharp boost in commodity prices but has failed to revive growth of the world 's largest economy .
In the euro zone , the latest data from economic powerhouse Germany showed a steep drop in business confidence and worries about the fiscal troubles ripping through the common currency area .
` ` The month of <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-08">August</TIMEX3> has seen one of the most dramatic turnarounds in the outlook for the global economy in living memory .
Continued political squabbling , combined with poor historical economic data released around the turn of the month , led to a dramatic collapse in financial market sentiment , with many risk assets experiencing the largest falls since the period immediately following the collapse of Lehman in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September 2008</TIMEX3> , '' Credit Suisse analysts said .
Analyst Davide Tabarelli from Nomisma Energy expected oil prices to shed a political risk premium gained on the back of the Libyan conflict .
` ` Prices increased by $ 20 because of Libya ; <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they should fall by at least that portion , '' Tabarelli said , adding it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">around three months</TIMEX3> to bring production in line with previous levels .
But Tabarelli was in the minority .
Four out of five analysts in the Reuters poll still saw <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> Brent prices above $ 100 .
` ` With the resumption of supplies from Libya , the oil price could come under pressure in the <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> , though it is unlikely to fall below $ 100 per barrel for long , '' Commerzbank analysts said in a note .
The fall in prices should also help tighten the gap between Brent and U.S. light crude prices to an average of $ 11.60 per barrel in <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> from around $ 24.90 a barrel <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> .
Despite an expected correction of feedstock prices , Petromatrix 's Jakob warned that product prices remained at high levels that are hampering demand , and the trickle of downward revisions to oil demand projections was underway .
The latest available data from MasterCard showed U.S. retail gasoline demand fell <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2011-W33">last week</TIMEX3> despite a drop in pump prices , in what analysts warned had been a difficult driving season .
