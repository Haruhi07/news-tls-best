TRIPOLI | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Aug 26 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-08-26T18:23">6:23 pm</TIMEX3> EDT TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels claimed to be close to capturing Muammar Gaddafi on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> as their NATO backers bombed diehard loyalists in his tribal bastion , but there was no sign of an end to the war , or to international wrangling over Libya 's riches .
Leaders of the National Transitional Council , which has Western support , pressed foreign governments to release Libyan funds frozen abroad , warning of its urgent need to impose order and provide services to a population traumatized by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> of conflict and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> of eccentric , personal rule .

But Gaddafi 's long - time allies in Africa , beneficiaries of his oil - fueled largesse and sympathizers with a foreign policy he called anti - colonial , offered the fugitive strongman a grain of comfort and irked the rebels by refusing to follow Arab and Western powers in recognizing the NTC as the legal government .
Combined with the reluctance of major powers like China , Russia and Brazil , to see Europeans and Americans dominate a nation with Africa 's biggest oil reserves , the African Union 's resistance may slow the pace at which funds are released .
Mahmoud Jibril , head of the government in waiting , said time was short .
Visiting NATO member Turkey , he said : ` ` We have to establish an army , strong police force to be able meet the needs of the people and we need capital and we need the assets .
` ` All our friends in the international community speak of stability and security .
We need that too . ''
While many African states have recognized the NTC , the AU would not do so as long as fighting continued , South African President Jacob Zuma , a vocal advocate for Gaddafi , said after a meeting in Addis Ababa at which the AU called for all sides in the conflict to negotiate a peace and work for democracy .
` ` If there is fighting , there is fighting , '' Zuma said .
` ` The process is fluid .
That 's part of what we inform countries -- whether there is an authority to recognize . ''
Rebel leaders are determined to show they are in charge , though estimates vary of when the TNC will move formally from its Benghazi base in the east to the war zone that is Tripoli .
` ` We have come to operate the country .
We are <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the legal authority , '' declared Mohammed al - Alagi , a lawyer who has been the TNC 's justice minister for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXM">some months</TIMEX3> , as he met foreign journalists in the capital wearing a rebel flag as a bandana .
Other TNC leaders , who stress they want to work with other rebel groups which sprang up later in the west as well with those who have previously supported Gaddafi , say the war will only be over once the fallen leader is caught , ` ` dead or alive . ''
Alagi voiced confidence that Gaddafi and his entourage of sons and aides was surrounded and would soon be captured : ` ` The area where he is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is under siege , '' he told Reuters , while declining to say where in Tripoli he thought Gaddafi was .
` ` The rebels are monitoring the area and they are dealing with it . ''
Similar confidence has proved misplaced since the irregular armies overran Gaddafi 's compound on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-08-23">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , however , and analysts do not rule out that the 69 - year - old , a veteran master of surprise , might have slipped away to rally supporters for an insurgency .
He has not been seen in public for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> , but made a defiant audio broadcast on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-08-25">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Colonel Hisham Buhagiar of the rebel force in the capital said Libyan commandos were targeting several areas : ` ` We are sending special forces <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> to hunt down Gaddafi .
We have one unit that does intelligence and other units that hunt him . ''
NATO forces , notably from France and Britain , are helping the rebels .
Many analysts assume they are giving intelligence and may have their own special forces troops on the ground .
Despite sporadic gunfire as rebel fighters tried to take pockets of loyalist resistance , Tripoli was quieter than in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
Dead bodies , the stench of rotting garbage in the oppressive <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">summer</TIMEX3> heat , wrecked cars and the other detritus of war were evidence of frantic battles and wildly erratic firing .
Some of Tripoli 's two million people , suffering from power cuts , dwindling supplies and a critical shortage of medical supplies and healthcare , ventured out to local mosques , some praying Gaddafi can be found by <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-08-22">Monday</TIMEX3> , when Muslims mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan with the festival of Eid .
` ` Gaddafi is the biggest criminal and dictator and we hope we will find him before the end of Ramadan , '' said Milad Abu Aisha , a 60 - year - old pensioner who joined friends at his local mosque for traditional worship on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-08-19">the last Friday</TIMEX3> of Ramadan .
` ` It will be the happiest Eid in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> , '' said Mohammed al - Misrati , a 52 - year - old office worker who was among hundreds streaming toward the mosque under the protection of armed local men who have formed ad hoc security units across the capital .
` ` We have a taste of freedom after <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P42Y">42 years</TIMEX3> of repression . ''
British aircraft fired cruise missiles at a headquarters bunker overnight in Gaddafi 's birthplace of Sirte .
A city beyond rebel control , on the Mediterranean coast 450 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , some believe he might seek refuge there among his tribesmen .
Loyalist forces also still hold positions deep in the Sahara desert .
` ` Sirte remains an operating base from which pro - Gaddafi troops project hostile forces against Misrata and Tripoli , '' a NATO official said , adding that its forces had also acted to stop a column of 29 vehicles heading west toward Misrata .
In Benghazi , rebel military spokesman Ahmed Bani said the bombing in Sirte was aimed at ammunition stores and depots for Scud missiles .
` ` Maybe the mercenaries will run away , '' he said , referring to suggestions Gaddafi 's forces include hired fighters from Chad and other sub - Saharan African countries .
` ` After this bombing , maybe the people there will try to rise up . ''
he added , saying TNC commanders were also in contact with tribal chiefs in Sirte , hoping to avoid bloodshed .
Such negotiations will be a major challenge across the country for Libya 's new rulers as they try to meet expectations of young men <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> bearing arms and to heal ethnic , tribal and other divisions that have been exacerbated by civil war .

One prayer answered ; a million more to go -- and those are just mine .
I just ca n't help thinking about the level of weapons attrition we 're creating in that area .
Losing so many weapons leaves that vicinity open to foreign invaders from their north or northeast .
We should be seriously be reconsidering our tactical resources and approach in that theater .
