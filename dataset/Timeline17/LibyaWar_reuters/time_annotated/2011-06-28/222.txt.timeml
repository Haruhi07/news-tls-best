WASHINGTON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-06-28">Jun 28 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-06-28T18:30">6:30 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - A U.S. Senate panel on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-28">Tuesday</TIMEX3> approved a resolution formally authorizing continued U.S. participation in the NATO - led military intervention in Libya but banning the introduction of U.S. troops on the ground there .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote marked another round in the debate in Washington over who has the power to make war , sparked by the President Barack Obama 's decision to commit the United States to the Libya conflict in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> without asking the U.S. Congress ' approval .
The committee voted 14 - 5 to approve the measure offered by Senator John Kerry , a Democrat , and Senator John McCain , a Republican , both supporters of the Libya intervention .

But the House of Representatives has already rejected a similar measure , reflecting the division in Congress over the issue and narrowing the chances that the Kerry - McCain resolution , which first has to be approved by the full Senate , will ever become law .
While the Obama administration would like Congress to express support for the Libya mission , it says it does not strictly need formal authorization by Congress .
This is because the U.S. military role in the NATO - led Libya operations has been limited , not rising to the level of war or ` ` hostilities '' under U.S. law , U.S. officials say .
This legalistic position , which was explained again to the committee in detail <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-06-28" mod="START">earlier Tuesday</TIMEX3> by State Department lawyer Harold Koh , has angered or annoyed many in both parties in Congress -- even some of those who support the Libya action .
Before passing the resolution , the senators effectively repudiated the administration 's argument by adopting an amendment that said continuation of the Libya operations does require congressional authorization .
ALL THOSE WHO VOTED NO WERE REPUBLICANS The United States and its NATO allies launched the U.N.-backed mission in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> , aiming to prevent Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's forces from attacking civilians opposed to his rule .
The mission , NATO - led since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> appears to have the unstated goal of driving Gaddafi from power .

The panel 's vote in favor of the resolution was a bipartisan 10 Democrats and four Republicans .
All those who voted against the measure were Republicans , including the panel 's top Republican , Richard Lugar , who cited the U.S. debt and two other wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as reasons not to wage war in Libya .
` ` In light of these circumstances , the lack of U.S. vital interest in Libya , I do not believe that we should be intervening in a civil war there , '' Lugar said .
Kerry said that <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> was not the time to bail out of Libya , with Gaddafi ` ` bunkered down in Tripoli '' and facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court .
` ` Do we want to stop this operation ?
That 's really what it comes down to , '' Kerry said ahead of the vote .
The resolution would authorize the U.S. role in Libya for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to one year</TIMEX3> after the date of enactment of the resolution by Congress , unless the NATO mission ends sooner .
It also says that the removal of Gaddafi is a political goal of U.S. policy , and calls for the United States and NATO to be reimbursed for the costs of the operation from assets seized from Gaddafi 's government .
Senator Bob Corker , a Republican who voted against the resolution , said the administration was basically ` ` sticking a stick in the eye '' of Congress by finding a narrow legal reason not to ask for authorization .
` ` The chairman mentioned -LRB- that -RRB- since no American is being shot , there 's no hostilities .
By that reasoning we could drop a nuclear bomb on Tripoli and we would not be involved in hostilities , and this goes to the sort of preposterous argument that is being made , '' Corker said .
Senator Jim Webb , a Democrat , agreed the administration 's argument that the Libyan conflict is not ` ` hostilities '' was ` ` contorted , '' but he voted for the authorization resolution .
Koh , in his appearance before the committee , declined to comment on reports that Obama ignored the advice of Pentagon and Justice Department lawyers who argued that U.S. military intervention in Libya required congressional authorization .
Since NATO took over the Libya operation on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-03-31">March 31</TIMEX3> , the United States has conducted 755 strike sorties , including 119 in which the planes fired at targets .
Thirty - nine of the strikes involved the use of drone aircraft .
The United States has also been providing reconnaissance , refueling , planning and other services to the NATO - led mission .
The committee voted down , 14 - 5 , a proposal by Lugar that would have ruled out U.S. participation in any more air strikes .
