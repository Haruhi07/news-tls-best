The White House rejected criticism of President Barack Obama 's decision to attack Libya , saying on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> he had briefed Congress and the public extensively before military action began <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-W11-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> .
Four senior administration officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , will also brief House members on Libya <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-30">next Wednesday</TIMEX3> , a House leadership aide said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The aide said the closed - door , classified briefing , which will also involve Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , came at the request of House Speaker John Boehner , who asked Obama in a letter on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> how he would measure success in Libya and whether Muammar Gaddafi had to depart as its leader before the U.S. military involvement ends .
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the administration had consulted repeatedly with Congress and read off a long list of meetings and briefings that the administration had already held for lawmakers .
` ` It 's part of his responsibility as president on an issue like this to consult with members of Congress , and he has done that .
He has instructed senior staff here to do that , and we have in a very substantial way consulted with Congress and will continue to do that , '' Carney said .
He refused to let reporters interrupt him , saying , ` ` It 's important that the American people understand how much consultation there has been . ''
Obama would be commenting publicly on Libya ` ` with relative frequency and relatively soon , '' Carney added .
Criticism of Obama for not consulting more with lawmakers before launching the Libyan operation has come from across the political spectrum .
Many liberals in Obama 's Democratic Party oppose a third war in the Muslim world on top of U.S. troop commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Republicans say the White House did not adequately explain the mission before it began .
Carney said Obama could not have waited for Congress to return from a recess because he needed to act quickly to prevent a massacre of Gaddafi 's opponents in Benghazi .
` ` American military action , international military action has saved an enormous number of lives in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P5D">the past five days</TIMEX3> , and that is something that Americans should be very proud of , '' Carney said .

Sorry Carney , the law says that the congress must approve US military action .
The only exception is if the US is under attack , or faces an imminent attack .
Libya 's civil war posed no threat to the United States .
Kucinich even said this is an impeachable offense .
