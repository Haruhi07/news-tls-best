BEIJING\/NEW DELHI | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-22">Mar 22 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-22T09:11">9:11 am</TIMEX3> EDT BEIJING\/NEW DELHI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - China said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that Western air strikes on Libya risked a ` ` humanitarian disaster , '' adding to the chorus of criticism from big emerging powers over the U.N.-authorized campaign .
China , with Russia , India , Brazil and other developing countries have condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as risky and unwarranted overreaching by the West .
The shared opposition to the Libya campaign could become a point of diplomatic convergence among the ` ` BRICS '' bloc of major emerging economies -- Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa -- which hold a summit in south China <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04">next month</TIMEX3> .
But it is unlikely to evolve into united action by this disparate group of countries , with their own mutual rivalries , said Shi Yinhong , a professor of international security at Renmin University in Beijing .
` ` Undoubtedly , many developing countries see a dangerous precedent in the Western attacks and intervention -LRB- in Libya -RRB- in what is fundamentally a civil war , '' said Shi .
` ` But Russia , China and the others will be afraid of a serious break with the United States or offending the Arab countries , so they wo n't push their opposition far , '' he said .
` ` I think the idea that the BRIC countries would act as a coalition on this is outlandish .
They are too deeply meshed with the West to risk a split , '' Shi added .
Western powers began the strikes against Libya over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W11-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> in a U.N.-sanctioned campaign to target air defenses , enforce a no - fly zone and protect civilians from Gaddafi 's forces .
India , China and Russia -- which , along with Brazil , abstained from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-W11">last week</TIMEX3> 's U.N. Security Council resolution -- have a history of opposing intervention in sovereign states .
They opposed the U.S.-led campaign over Kosovo in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> , when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed , and also opposed the U.S. led invasion of Iraq .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , compared the campaign in Libya to the Iraq invasion , saying it ` ` resembles medieval calls for crusades .
Brazil 's criticisms have been relatively muted .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">Monday</TIMEX3> , it called for a ceasefire in Libya and regretted the loss of life there .
Of the BRICS , only South Africa supported the U.N. Resolution .
China has been among the loudest in voicing opposition .
` ` We have noted the reports about civilian casualties from the military action against Libya by the countries concerned , and we express our deep concern about this , '' the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a news conference in Beijing .
` ` The original intent of the -LRB- U.N. -RRB- Security Council resolution was to protect the security of the Libya 's people .
We oppose the wanton use of armed force causing even more civilian casualties and an even bigger humanitarian disaster . ''
She added that French President Nicolas Sarkozy , a strong proponent of the most vocal proponents of the no - fly zone over Libya , will visit China at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3> to attend a seminar on global monetary reform .
` ` What is happening in a country , within their internal affairs , no external powers should interfere in it , '' Pranab Mukherjee , India 's finance minister and leader of the lower house of parliament , told lawmakers in New Delhi on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` Nobody , not a couple of countries , can take that decision to change a particular regime , '' Mukherjee said .

The emerging powers could maintain their more united front over Libya in the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> ahead of the BRICS summit in China , said Srinath Raghavan , a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi .
` ` If there is a serious ceasefire proposal or negotiated settlement , then the BRICS could well jump in diplomatically .
They may want to then shape a global consensus if the West 's policies get in trouble , '' Raghavan said .
