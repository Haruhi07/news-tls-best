Reuters -RRB- - Walking down a Tripoli street with a bag full of freshly baked bread , a Libyan man frowned when he saw crowds of children chanting the praises of Brother Leader Muammar Gaddafi .
As explosions from what appeared to be NATO air strikes echoed in Tripoli , hundreds of children were taken by bus to a square outside a United Nations office , given green flags of Gaddafi 's revolution and told to shout anti - Western slogans .
` ` The children were brought here .
This is their education .
They shout all day instead of studying , '' said the man , shaking his head .
He said he always supported Gaddafi but was upset with the authorities allowing Libya to descend into civil war .
` ` Cameron is a problem , he is bombing Libya , '' he said , in a reference to Britain 's part in the NATO campaign against Libya .
` ` But this is a problem too , '' he added , pointing at the children .
Gaddafi has been in power for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than four decades</TIMEX3> and two generations have grown up under his iron rule .
In a country with a median age of about 24 , most Libyans have known no other leader .

A rebellion in the east may have emboldened Libyans there to speak about democratic change , but here in Gaddafi 's stronghold his personality cult still weighs heavily on people 's minds .
His portraits , usually showing Gaddafi in military uniform with rays of light shining behind him , adorn many houses .
Soldiers , their heads wrapped in green turbans , patrol the city .
State television plays patriotic songs and broadcasts images of Libyan tanks rolling through the desert .
Dancing under the watchful eye of teachers and government minders , hundreds of children chanted ` ` Down , down USA '' and set off firecrackers outside the gates of the U.N. office .
Some held gold - framed portraits of Gaddafi .
Adults encouraged children to kiss the leader 's image in front of television cameras .
Outside coffee shops , passersby clutching steaming cups stopped to watch the procession with bewilderment .
Most children seemed indifferent to their task .
For them , Gaddafi 's dominance is no novelty in a country where they have to study his Green Book of aphorisms as part of their curriculum .
While the propaganda machine works overtime to prop up the image of a strong state , weeks of conflict and Western air strikes seemed to have loosened Gaddafi 's hold on people 's minds .
Even during the most tightly controlled events , dissent is always evident .
People are talking about change with varying degrees of openness , saying it is time for Gaddafi to go .
` ` People need to hope for change , '' a bookshop owner said quietly on a <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> visit .
` ` Nothing more needs to be said . ''
Ali , owner of a clothing shop , said he could not forgive a government that had given orders to shoot its own people during peaceful anti - government protests in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> , a chain of events at the start of the uprising that led to the war .
` ` I used to love Gaddafi but many people have died , '' he said .
` ` It changed everything .
Business was good before <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> .
We can not live like this .
Things have to change . ''
On the surface , Gaddafi 's influence is still strong in Tripoli .
People avoid eye contact with foreign journalists .
` ` Sarkozy , Cameron , Obama killer for petroleum , '' says an English - language banner in central Green Square .
At al Fatah university , the picture was much the same .
Hundreds of students , some draped in green flags head to toe , were taken by bus into the campus from all around Tripoli to celebrate Gaddafi 's rule on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-04-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We love Gaddafi .
We hate the world , '' shouted one high school student .
` ` We want to kill our enemies . ''
