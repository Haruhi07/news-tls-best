But governments in the Sahel believe fighters of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB-
AQIM -RRB- have received convoys of weapons including SA-7 missiles looted from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's abandoned arms caches .
Targeting airliners would take training and moving al Qaeda cells nearer cities , so experts believe any heavy weapons are more likely to be used defensively in case of airborne attacks on the Islamist militants .
However the remote and often volatile corners of countries such as Mauritania , Mali and Niger , where Islamists operate alongside rebels , local criminals and smugglers , are extremely vulnerable to the spillover effects of Libya 's conflict .
` ` The situation in Libya poses quite some problems for West African countries , '' said Kwesi Aning , a senior official at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center in Ghana .
` ` It is natural that some of the weapons would get into very bad hands ...
There is no government control in the northern parts -LRB- of the Sahel fringing Libya -RRB- , ''
Aning told Reuters .
AQIM emerged out of the Algerian Salafist movement in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> and , under pressure from the Algerian army to the north , has become increasingly active in the Sahara region .
The group , believed to number no more than a few hundred , has taken advantage of poor cross - border coordination to mount sporadic attacks on local armies and kidnap Westerners , earning some $ 50 - 70 million in ransoms so far , analysts say .
A <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> flurry of regional diplomacy has underscored pressing concerns over a spillover from Libya .
Fears of a reprisal after the killing of Osama bin Laden are also high .

The leaders of Mali and Chad believe looted weapons have reached AQIM bases in northern Mali , with Chad 's president warning they could become the best - equipped force in the region .
An Algerian official spoke of several convoys .
Others say there is no proof yet , though few think it would take much for AQIM , which is plugged into weapons smuggling networks and flush in cash from ransoms , to obtain them .
` ` There are enough floating around that it would be extremely easy for people keen to get hold of them to do so , '' said Peter Bouckaert , emergencies director at Human Rights Watch , who has spent weeks documenting the looted arsenals in Libya .
Much of the focus has been on missing SA-7 shoulder - launched missiles , used by al Qaeda operatives who tried , but failed , to shoot down an Israeli charter plane in Kenya in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> .
` ` It is a top concern because this is one of the favorite weapons of al Qaeda groups , '' Bouckaert said , noting that militants in Iraq showed how stolen weapons could also be turned into bombs .
Officials are acutely aware of the threat and fears of a ` ` spectacular '' attack in retaliation for the killing of bin Laden are real , but due to their short range , SA-7s would have to be moved by militants from remote desert bases to near airports by major cities if airliners were to be targeted , experts say .
` ` They are probably more useful as defensive weapons , '' said one diplomat who monitors the group 's activities .
After mostly opportunistic kidnappings , attacks <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> in Niamey and Nouakchott have proven AQIM 's ambition to hit capital cities .
But another hurdle is the weapon itself , according to Nick Pratt , a terrorism expert at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies .
` ` It is not a weapon you just pick up and shoot ...
The big issue is that it takes a long time to train , '' said Pratt , whose military experience included taking part in covert U.S. efforts to arm Mujahideen guerrillas in Afghanistan .
` ` Old Soviet - era -LRB- missiles -RRB- in the Sahara are less of a security concern than a truckload of AK 's -LRB- assault rifles -RRB- . ''
It may not just be the weapons that flow south either .
There are widespread reports of Gaddafi recruiting fighters , especially Tuareg nomads , to swell his ranks .
Some of these new recruits , as well as fighters from the region who had long been in his ranks , will return home <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> , officials say .
Similar flows of experienced fighters back into marginalized parts of Mali and Niger were factors in rebellions during <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> .
These countries ' governments are still struggling to heal wounds after the most <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> uprisings between <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
` ` There is something of a historical pattern we do n't want to repeat , '' said Andre LeSage , Africa expert at the U.S - based National Defense University .
Northern Mali , with its grinding poverty and isolation , is particularly susceptible .
AQIM has turned it into a rear base , integrating into local tribes through marriage and seeking to drive a wedge between the government and local populations .
Profitable smuggling networks also zigzag through the barren zone , undermining law and order and fuelling corruption .
Mali President Amadou Toumani Toure <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-W18">last week</TIMEX3> sought out support among community leaders , warning them of the risks of the flow of weapons and fear of AQIM recruiting new fighters .
` ` We need community leaders to be on good terms with national governments so there is n't popular support for any movement ...
so they do n't gain traction , '' LeSage said .
