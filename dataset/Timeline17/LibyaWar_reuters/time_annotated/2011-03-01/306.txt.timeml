Clinton : ` ` strategic American response will be essential '' \ * Defends ` ` lean budget for lean times '' and urges no cuts \ * Short - term savings can lead to big costs later - Clinton WASHINGTON , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">March 1</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
Libya could become a peaceful democracy or face a drawn - out civil war , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , urging U.S. lawmakers not to cut funds needed to deal with crises abroad .
American global leadership needs both resolve and resources , Clinton told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee .
` ` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos .
The stakes are high , '' she said .
` ` The entire -LRB- Middle East -RRB- region is changing , and a strong and strategic American response will be essential . ''
The turmoil in Libya , where Muammar Gaddafi is trying to crush a revolt , was an example of how Washington had to use its diplomatic and defense assets as well as development aid to ` ` protect our interests and advance our values , '' she told the lawmakers , some of whom want to cut overseas spending .
Clinton spoke <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after the United States began moving warships and aircraft closer to Libya , and froze $ 30 billion in assets , steeping up pressure on Gaddafi to give up power .

The U.S. Agency for International Development is sending two humanitarian teams to the region to help provide food and medicine to Libyans fleeing into Tunisia and Egypt .
` ` We are taking no options off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to turn its guns on its own people , '' she said .
Clinton has just returned from Geneva , where she discussed Libya with other governments outraged over Gadaffi 's violent attempt to put down the rebellion against his 41 - year rule .
Clinton was invited to testify to the House panel in defense of President Barack Obama 's $ 47 billion budget request for the State Department and the USAID .
That is up 1 percent from 2010 levels .
Clinton called it a ` ` lean budget for lean times . ''
Republicans , who took control of the House in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> elections , have called for a tough new look at non - military overseas spending amid widespread calls to control the ballooning U.S. federal deficit .
Clinton said Americans were justifiably concerned about the national debt but insisted they also wanted investments in the future , including diplomacy and aid to other countries .
Retreating from international responsibilities often imposed long - term costs , she said , as happened in Afghanistan when the United States ` ` walked away '' after the Cold War ended and Soviet troops had gone home .
` ` We saved money in the short term .

But those savings came at an unspeakable cost -- one we are still paying , <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2020">10 years later</TIMEX3> , in money and lives , '' she said .
Obama has proposed spending almost $ 110 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> on Afghanistan , where he has pledged to begin withdrawing the first of about 100,000 U.S. troops fighting Taliban insurgents by <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="MID">the middle of this year</TIMEX3> .
Of this amount , about $ 107 billion is military spending .
The State Department , mounting its own civilian ` ` surge '' aimed at stabilizing Afghanistan , would spend an extra $ 2.2 billion there as it seeks to increase assistance programs .
` ` Retreating from our civilian surge in Afghanistan -- with our troops still in the field -- would be a grave mistake , '' Clinton said .
She said U.S. aid to Pakistan was ` ` equally important . ''
Obama proposes maintaining significant aid to Pakistan to arm , train and equip its military to fight extremists with about $ 1.1 billion earmarked for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund , roughly the same level as <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> .
The Obama administration is launching its requests for the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> budget at a time when spending for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> is still not approved by Congress .
Clinton said the 16 percent cut to the State Department and USAID included in a House - passed spending bill for <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011-02">last month</TIMEX3> would be ` ` devastating to our national security . ''
