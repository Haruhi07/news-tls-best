Reuters -RRB- - Libya could descend into civil war unless Muammar Gaddafi quits , the United States said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , its demand for his departure intensifying pressure on the longtime leader after news of Western military preparations .
Gaddafi remained defiant , dispatching forces to a western border area amid fears that the most violent Arab revolt may grow bloodier and cause a humanitarian crisis .
Tunisian border guards fired into the air on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to try to control a crowd of people clamoring to cross the frontier and escape the violence .
About 70,000 people have passed through the Ras Jdir border post in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P2W">the past two weeks</TIMEX3> , and many more of the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in Libya are expected to follow .
