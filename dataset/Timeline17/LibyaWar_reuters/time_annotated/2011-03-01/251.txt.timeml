On paper , Libya 's military has some 100,000 troops , more than 2,000 tanks , 374 aircraft and a navy and includes two patrol submarines .
What Colonel Muammar Gaddafi actually has left to call on is a different matter .
Here are some details of Libya 's armed forces , officially totaling around 76,000 active personnel , plus a reserve or people 's militia of some 40,000 .
GROUND FORCES - STRENGTH ON PAPER : Numbers : 50,000 including 25,000 conscripts .
Main Battle Tanks - 2,205 , including 180 T-90S and 200 T-62 .
The rest are in store .
Armored personnel carriers - 945 .
Even before the uprising , Libya 's military strength was seen as having been seriously undermined by sanctions and neglect although Western powers had just began to sell it weapons again .
Much of the equipment is seen as poorly maintained or unusable , leaving it hard to estimate genuine numbers .
Analysts say Gaddafi tried to emasculate the regular army to avoid the emergence of commanders who might rival his immediate family , relying instead particularly on three loyal ` ` regime protection '' units often of his own tribe .
That leaves him with what most estimate to be some 10 - 12 , 000 loyal Libyan troops .
The most reliable formation is seen to be the 32nd Brigade commanded by Gaddafi 's son Khamis .
Repeated reports from witnesses , rights groups and others talk of African mercenaries flown in by Gaddafi to help strengthen his government .
Exact numbers are impossible to obtain .
In Libya 's east around the city of Benghazi , regular military forces appear to have either defected to the opposition or melted away .
Citizens groups also appear to have taken arms .
But analysts say the opposition lacks much in the way of command and control or even any form of centralized leadership .
So far , opposition units have focused primarily on defending territory and have shown little appetite to advance .
That leaves loyalist forces trying to stem protest and perhaps regain lost territory in Libya 's west around Tripoli .
The key coastal city of Sirte between Tripoli and Benghazi is still under government control and the east effectively lost .
But experts warn the situation remains fluid .
` ` We underestimate the degree of loyalty in the security forces , '' warns Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute .
` ` The defections appear to be patchwork and possibly along tribal lines .
The units that matter , such as Khamis 's 32nd Brigade , are holding together .
NAVY - STRENGTH ON PAPER Submarines - 2 patrol submarines .
Libya 's two surviving Foxtrot class diesel submarines were delivered by the Soviet Union in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="198" mod="END">the late 1980s</TIMEX3> , but outside experts have long questioned their reliability .
According to IHS Jane 's , in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> one was reported to be in dry dock and one was sea going -- although unlikely to be fully operational .
It suggested both might already have been abandoned .
AIR FORCE - STRENGTH ON PAPER Combat capable aircraft - 374 .
227 fighter aircraft -- 13 - Mirage F1 - ED , 94 MiG-25 , 75 MiG-23 and 45 MiG-21 .
Helicopters - 85 Support helicopters Analysts estimate many of Libya 's fast jets are in fact no longer airworthy .
Gaddafi has so far also lost at least three aircraft in the course of this uprising with two jets defecting to Malta and the crew of a third ejecting over the desert rather than bomb opposition targets as ordered .
Occasional reports have also spoken of the use of helicopter gunships , fuelling calls for foreign powers to impose a no - fly zone .
There are also Air Defense Command forces which possess at least 216 surface - to - air missiles and 144 towed and 72 self propelled missiles .
Again , maintenance may be an issue .
Most analysts believe Libya 's armed forces would not be able to seriously threaten outside air forces attempting to enforce a no - fly zone , saying Gaddafi 's defense capabilities probably lag behind those of Iraq 's Saddam Hussein before the US - led <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> invasion .
The BBC reported a British RAF Hercules transport aircraft evacuating foreign nationals came under small arms fire <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-W09">this week</TIMEX3> but was not seriously damaged .
Some suggested the attack might have come from opposition forces who mistook the plane for one of Gaddafi 's aircraft on a bombing raid .
According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -LRB- OPCW -RRB- , Libya destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical weapons munitions in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2004" mod="START">early 2004</TIMEX3> as part of a rapprochement with the West that also saw it abandon a nuclear program .
The OPCW told Reuters Libya did retain some 9.5 tons of deadly mustard gas at a secret desert location but no longer had the capability to deliver it .

I pray for those who take a stand and put their lives on the line to free Libya of the despicable despot .
Libya 's rebels need to find a political leader to crystallize their efforts and be able to form a temporary government .
Then if invited by the people 's representative the West should support the people of Libya by sending in troops and ending this bloodshed quickly !
