The prime minister told a news conference he had approved humanitarian missions to Libya from the island , which according to its constitution is neutral and non - aligned .
Some 12,000 oil workers have been evacuated in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> by air and ferries to Malta , which has a population of just 410,000 .
A rapid succession of flights is taking them on to their home countries .
More evacuated workers arrived from Libya on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> with a German - chartered ship bringing some 500 workers of many nationalities .
The island had also been the departure point for rescue flights by the British Royal Air Force to pick up workers from the desert .
The flights have been carried out without Libyan authorization .
Gonzi said Malta was offering its service as a coordinating center for international humanitarian aid to Libya .
A number of Maltese NGOs have already started public collections of food and medicines .
Anti - Gaddafi protesters scrambled up the facade of the two - storey Libyan embassy in Valletta on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and raised the pre - Gaddafi Libyan flag .
Libyan Ambassador Saadun Suayeh , who had earlier met the protesters , said he would accept any flag which represented the Libyan people .
He said he intended to stay in his post but would meet Foreign Minister Tonio Borg .
In media comments <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two days</TIMEX3> , the ambassador has made a distinction between the Libyan people and the Libyan government and said the embassy represented all of Libya .
