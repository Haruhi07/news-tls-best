Libyan oil output cut by at least half , Saudi steps in PARIS\/RIYADH | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Feb 28 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-02-28T13:40">1:40 pm</TIMEX3> EST PARIS\/RIYADH -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
The uprising in Libya has cut its oil output by half , the International Energy Agency said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> , but Saudi Arabia 's pledge to pump more helped to prevent a further surge in the price of oil .
The head of Italian oil company ENI , the biggest foreign operator in Libya , said he thought two - thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted and warned oil extraction could halt if shipments did not resume .
Foreign firms have been pulling staff out of Libya due to the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule .
China 's three major state - owned oil and gas companies have evacuated all their Chinese employees .
U.S. oil firm Marathon Oil Corp also said it had evacuated all expatriate employees and their dependents from Libya , while ConocoPhillips said it had closed its operations there and evacuated some employees due to the unrest .
About half of Libya 's 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of production had been cut , IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol told Reuters Insider TV , citing industry reports .
That is higher than the IEA estimated initially .
Oil prices jumped toward $ 120 a barrel <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W08">last week</TIMEX3> for the first time since <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> because of the disruption in Libya , the world 's 12th largest oil exporter .
Prices have since eased to $ 112 , partly because Saudi Arabia has promised to meet any shortages .
` ` This is not good news for suppliers in the market but at the same time it is very comforting that Saudi Arabia showed their readiness to make up , '' Birol told Reuters in the interview .
All demands for extra oil have been met , the head of Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco said on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The kingdom has boosted its output to around 9 million bpd , a senior Saudi source told Reuters , to meet demand .
` ` All incremental needs requested by our customers have been met , '' Saudi Aramco CEO Khalid al - Falih said .
As well as the scale of the loss of Libya 's oil , the duration of the shutdown is also a concern to oil markets .
Some analysts expect it may be out for a while .
` ` With Libya apparently at risk of a civil war , there are reasons to believe that oil supplies in that country could be off for months , '' Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note .
Libya 's oil exports and oil tanker loadings remained at a virtual standstill .
The country exports about 1.3 million bpd of high - quality crude , mostly to Europe .
The size of the cut in Libya 's oil output remains unclear partly because of disrupted communications with the country .
Eni 's chief executive , Paolo Scaroni , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> he thought two - thirds of Libyan oil and gas output had been halted .
He had put the disruption at 1.2 million bpd , or 75 percent , <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W08">last week</TIMEX3> .
Most of Libya 's oilfields are no longer under Gaddafi 's control , the European Union 's energy commissioner said on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-02-28">Monday</TIMEX3> .
A unit of Libya 's state - owned National Oil Corp has decided to operate separately from its parent until Gaddafi is overthrown and Tripoli is free of his rule , an official said .
