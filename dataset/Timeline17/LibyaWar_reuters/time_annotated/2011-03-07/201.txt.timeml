TRIPOLI | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-07">Mar 7 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-07T04:49">4:49 am</TIMEX3> IST TRIPOLI -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Troops loyal to Muammar Gaddafi launched counter - offensives against rebel - held towns on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> , increasing fears that Libya is heading for a civil war rather than the swift revolutions seen in Tunisia and Egypt .
The Gaddafi government proclaimed sweeping overnight victories over what it called terrorist bands .
But after what residents said was <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> of fierce fighting with artillery , rockets and mortar bombs , rebel forces announced they had fought off Gaddafi 's forces in the towns of Zawiyah , to the immediate west of Tripoli , and Misrata to the east .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-07">Today</TIMEX3> Misrata witnessed the toughest battle since the beginning of the revolution .
Horrible attacks , '' one resident , who did not want to give his name , told Reuters by phone .
` ` They came from three sides and managed to enter the town from the west and south
but when they reached the center of Misrata the rebels pushed them back , '' he said .
Misrata , with a population of 300,000 , is the largest town controlled by rebels outside the rebel - held east of the country .
If rebel soldiers were able to continue their fitful advance westwards , Misrata could be a stepping stone to reaching the capital , Gaddafi 's principal stronghold .
Rebel council spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told a Benghazi news conference : ` ` We would like to put the people of this great nation at ease ... because the regime is spreading rumors .
` ` Both Zawiyah and Misrata are secured , liberated cities . ''
Gaddafi 's troops , backed by tanks , artillery , warplanes and helicopters attacked positions near the oil port of Ras Lanuf , 660 km -LRB- 410 miles -RRB- east of the capital .
Rebels were forced to retreat from Bin Jawad which is on the road to Sirte , the hometown of Gaddafi who has ruled the OPEC oil and gas producer for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P41Y">41 years</TIMEX3> .
` ` Gaddafi 's cut us to pieces .
He 's firing on us with tanks and missiles .
I do n't know what we 're going to do <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' Momen Mohammed told Reuters .
One fighter returning wounded to Ras Lanuf from Bin Jawad was asked what he had seen .
` ` Death , '' he replied , too distraught to say any more .
Rebels said they planned another attack on Bin Jawad , which is only 160 km -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- from Sirte , on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2011-03-07TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3> .
Rebel commanders told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces were reinforcing Sirte where they had more than 20,000 fighters .
They said the city houses the Saadi -LRB- a son of Gaddafi -RRB- battalion which includes four brigades , as well as armed tribe members .
Loyalists had poured into the streets of Tripoli at dawn on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> firing into the air and holding portraits of Gaddafi .
` ` These are celebrations because government forces have taken control of all areas to Benghazi and are in the process of taking control of Benghazi , '' spokesman Mussa Ibrahim said , referring to Libya 's second city , situated in the far east .

But the celebrations appeared to be premature as Benghazi remained firmly under rebel control while insurgents stood their ground at Zawiyah and Misrata .
Rebels surrounded by troops near the center of Zawiyah , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , faced another attack after repelling two assaults by tanks and infantry the day before .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="TIME" value="2011-03-07TMO">This morning</TIMEX3> , there was a new attack , bigger than <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
There were one and a half hours of fighting ...
Two people were killed from our side and many more injured , '' spokesman Youssef Shagan said by telephone .
Elite brigades under Gaddafi 's son Khamis also launched an assault on Misrata , 200 km -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- east of the capital .
` ` The brigades tried to reach the center of the town but revolutionaries managed to repel them .
They retreated to the airbase , '' said a resident who declined to be named .
` ` The revolutionaries captured 20 soldiers and seized a tank .
The town is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> fully in the control of the youths , '' he said .
At least 18 people , including a baby , were killed in the fighting in Misrata on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> , a doctor told Reuters by phone .
` ` We have 18 martyrs but the figure is not final .
We also have many people wounded , I can not even count them , '' said the doctor , who works at Misrata main hospital , adding that the dead included rebels and civilians .
Doctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting .
A French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive .
Britain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi had <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> left Libya .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB-
SAS -RRB- unit had been captured during a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired .
` ` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces .
They could not ascertain if they were friends or foes .
For our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said earlier .
Western leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces .
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-03-06">Sunday</TIMEX3> that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi .
` ` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper .
` ` The flow of money must be cut off . ''
The International Energy Agency said the revolt had blocked about 60 percent of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd oil output .
The drop , due largely to the flight of thousands of foreign oil workers , will batter the economy and have already jacked up crude prices abroad .
