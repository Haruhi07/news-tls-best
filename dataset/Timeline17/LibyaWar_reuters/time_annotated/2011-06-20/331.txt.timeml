The Libyan government said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> 19 civilians were killed in a NATO air strike on the home of one of Muammar Gaddafi 's top officials , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after NATO admitted killing civilians in a separate aerial attack .
Libyan officials took reporters to Surman , 70 km -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli , to the site of what they said was a NATO air strike on the home of Khouildi Hamidi , a member of Libya 's 12 - strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi .
Rescue teams were looking for survivors while reporters visited the site .
Reporters were then taken to a hospital in nearby Sabrata where they were shown nine bodies , including those of two children , plus some body parts , which the Libyan government said were all of people killed in the attack .
The state - run Jana news agency later reported on its website that eight children were among 19 people killed in the attack .
The dead included members of Hamidi 's family , it said .
The government said Hamidi himself was not hurt .
NATO said it had bombed a ` ` legitimate military target -- a command and control node '' in the area , and it could not confirm whether civilians had been hurt .
It said NATO does not target specific individuals .
` ` This strike will greatly degrade the Gaddafi regime forces ' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people , '' Lieutenant - General Charles Bouchard , the Canadian commander of NATO 's Libya operation , said in a statement .
If the Libyan government 's account of civilian deaths is confirmed , the incident could further complicate operations of the NATO - led military alliance , starting to feel the strain of a campaign that is taking longer and costing more than planned .
NATO acknowledged on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> for the first time that it had killed multiple civilians in Libya , when a strike intended to hit a missile site erred and destroyed a house in Tripoli .
Bouchard said he regretted the loss of life in that incident , and a system failure may have knocked the weapon off course .
Libyan officials say NATO forces have killed more than 700 civilians , although they have not presented evidence of such large numbers of civilian deaths and NATO denies them .
Libya says one of Gaddafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-W19">six weeks ago</TIMEX3> when Gaddafi 's Tripoli compound was hit .
Italy 's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> civilian deaths pose a risk to the NATO - led military alliance .
NATO states have been hitting targets in Libya since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-19">March 19</TIMEX3> in what they say is an operation to protect civilians .
` ` NATO is endangering its credibility ; we can not risk killing civilians , '' Frattini told reporters before an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Luxembourg to discuss ways to aid rebels .
The Arab League , which in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-03">March</TIMEX3> asked the United Nations Security Council to impose a no - fly zone over Libya to protect civilians , condemned the loss of life in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-06-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> 's incident .
` ` When the Arab League agreed on the idea of having a no - fly zone over Libya it was to protect civilians but when civilians get killed this has to be condemned with the harshest of statements , '' said Deputy Secretary - General Ahmed Ben Helli .
The Libyan leader says the Western - led military campaign is an act of colonial aggression designed to steal Libya 's oil .
Libyan officials accused NATO of deliberately targeting the population .
Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> 's strike on Hamidi 's house ` ` a cowardly terrorist act . ''
Frattini expressed concern that NATO was losing the propaganda war : ` ` We can not continue our shortcomings in the way we communicate with the public , which does n't keep up with the daily propaganda of Gaddafi . ''
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States joined NATO in regretting loss of civilian life .
` ` These missions are extremely difficult .
They are extremely dangerous .
We faced this situation in Afghanistan , we faced it in the past in Kosovo , '' she said .
` ` It 's always an issue in any NATO mission to maintain popular support , to maintain public understanding for why we are there ... ''
Ashour Shamis , a UK - based Libyan opposition activist , said Hamidi played a key role in Gaddafi 's war against the rebels .
` ` He is very much there , controlling the army and supervising military activities , '' he said .
NATO continued its three - month campaign of air strikes on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> .
A Reuters reporter in central Tripoli said he heard jets overhead around midday , then a distant explosion .
There were no details immediately available on what was hit .
The rebels have made slow progress since NATO countries joined the fight <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-03">three months ago</TIMEX3> , but are <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> advancing toward Tripoli from a bastion in Misrata east of the capital and from the Western Mountains region to its southwest .
Shelling attacks by loyalist forces positioned outside Misrata killed 11 civilians in the rebel - held coastal city on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> , a doctor at the main hospital there said by phone .
Those included a child who was killed when a salvo of three rockets fired by Gaddafi forces hit a built - up area near the port , a Reuters reporter said .
Two more children were wounded .
A rebel at the scene named Hassan Douwa said : ` ` Is NATO waiting for Gaddafi to kill us all before it does its job ?
Give us the planes and we will do it ourselves . ''
Rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan in Misrata said Gaddafi 's forces intensified their shelling of Misrata on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> , with at least 20 rockets landing in the city center .
Rebels in the Western Mountains said they had shut off a pipeline that supplies crude from an oilfield in the south to the Zawiyah refinery near the capital Tripoli .
The refinery is one of the few sources of fuel for Gaddafi - held areas .
` ` This is an attempt by the rebels to stifle the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli , '' rebel spokesman Juma Ibrahim said by phone from the Western Mountains town of Zintan .
Rebels have been boosted by defections of Gaddafi loyalists .
They said on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> 22 soldiers had defected from a unit in the south .
Gaddafi officials say defections have not made a significant dent in government forces .
Rebel diplomatic chief Mahmoud Jibril is due on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2011-06-14">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to travel to China , which has not taken a firm side in Libya 's civil war but has tried to expand ties with the opposition .
EU foreign ministers agreed at their meeting in Luxembourg on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2011-06-20">Monday</TIMEX3> to look into the possibility of using frozen Libyan funds to assist the rebels .
The rebel oil and finance minister accused the West on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2011-06-18">Saturday</TIMEX3> of failing to keep promises of vital financial aid , leaving the rebels without any money to continue their four - month campaign to unseat Gaddafi .
In a joint statement they said the European Union acknowledged the urgent financial needs of the rebel transitional council , which requires more than $ 3 billion to cover salaries and other needs in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the next six months</TIMEX3> .

Accidents happen everyday in all areas , but especially , when a CRAZY man tries to hang on to Power for the sake of Power , but hides behind his people using them as human shields .
` ` They -LRB- local people -RRB- do n't like this ...
But they do n't like the regime either . ''
by ` ` Tony '' was the accurate lead sub - headline .
What should ` ` sow ... doubts '' was the length of time it took a -RRB- the World to come to the aid of Ben Ghazi , and b -RRB- NATO to decide helicopter gunships were the only logical defense .
How many hundreds or thousands of lives were lost by such dawdling ?
Why ca n't they take out Gaddafi in the same way we took out Osama bin Laden ?
It seems to me that we need a much larger NATO military force to take care of these so - called world leaders that are nothing more than dictators .
I would think it would be much cheaper and much more efficient in the long run .
