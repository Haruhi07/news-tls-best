Britain recognized the NTC as Libya 's sole legitimate government in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> and said it would invite a new Libyan diplomatic mission made up of opponents of Gaddafi .
` ` The National Transitional Council is the sole legitimate governmental authority in Libya .
It is therefore right that their representatives are <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> staffing the Libyan Embassy , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement .
The Times newspaper reported that Gaddafi 's government was planning to use anti - squatter laws to try to evict the embassy 's new occupants .
It said Gaddafi 's lawyers were also seeking to challenge Britain 's recognition of the opposition and to prevent Britain from using frozen Libyan state assets .
A Foreign Office spokesman said he was not aware of any such legal proceedings against the British government .
The NTC had said families of rebel civil war victims would hoist the red , black and green flag representing the Libyan rebel movement over the embassy in the Belgravia district .
The green Libyan flag of the Gaddafi government flew above the building until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W32-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> .
It has since been removed .
` ` The reopening of the Embassy symbolises how far we have come .
The Embassy represents the legitimate government of Libya and in line with this , will serve all the Libyan community irrespective of their political allegiances , '' the new charge d'affaires , Mahmud Nacua , said in a statement .
