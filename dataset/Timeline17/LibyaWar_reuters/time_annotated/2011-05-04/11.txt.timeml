Reuters -RRB- - Sudan has deployed troops at the Libyan border to prevent arms smuggling to rebels in Darfur and closed the Libyan consulate in the troubled region , a government official said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-05-04">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Sudan shares an almost 400 - km - long -LRB- 240 - mile -RRB- border with Libya where a civil war against leader Muammar Gaddafi has split the desert state into a government - held western area around the capital Tripoli and an eastern region held by rebels .
` ` We deployed troops at the border to Libya because we are worried about arms smuggling -LRB- to rebels -RRB- , '' Khalid Musa , spokesman for the Sudanese foreign ministry , said .
Sudan closed the Libyan consulate in al - Fasher in Darfur and asked staff to leave within <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2D">48 hours</TIMEX3> after Libya had closed the Sudanese consulate in the eastern town of al - Kufrah , Musa said .
` ` We summoned the Libyan ambassador for an explanation why the consulate was closed but his answer came too late and was not satisfactory so we closed the Libyan consulate , '' he said .
There is little love lost between Gaddafi and Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir , who was indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide and other war crimes in Darfur .
Relations were strained between Libya and Sudan after Gaddafi agreed to offer refuge to Darfur rebel Justice and Equality Movement chief Khalil Ibrahim , who had left peace talks in Qatar to return to fighting in Darfur .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">Last year</TIMEX3> , Libya promised to curb any Darfur rebel attacks .
Gaddafi hosted and helped insurgents early in the Darfur conflict , which began in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> when mostly non - Arab rebels took up arms , accusing Khartoum of neglect .
Sudan 's counterinsurgency campaign drove more than 2 million Darfuris from their homes , sparking one of the world 's worst humanitarian crises that the United Nations estimates has killed as many as 300,000 people .
