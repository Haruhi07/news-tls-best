WASHINGTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-02">Mar 2 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-02T16:21">4:21 pm</TIMEX3> GMT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - An unpublished U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks tells the previously undisclosed story of how an American corporate powerhouse -- the $ 35 - billion -LRB- 21 billion pounds -RRB-
Coca - Cola Co. -LRB- KO .
N -RRB- -- got caught up in a fierce fraternal dispute between two of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's sons .
The contretemps among the freres Gaddafi over a local bottling plant escalated into a heavily armed confrontation resembling a Hollywood gangster film , as a classified <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> U.S. cable put it .
` ` You know the movie ` The Godfather ' ?
We ' ve been living it for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the last few months</TIMEX3> , '' a businessman involved in the dispute was quoted in the cable as telling an official from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Tripoli .
The cable , which was made available to Reuters by a third party , centres on a bottling plant in Tripoli that was shut down for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
It had been seized by troops loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , a son of Muammar , who at the time was feuding with one of his brothers , Mohammed .
-LRB- Another State Department cable suggests a third Gaddafi son , Saadi -- better known as the family 's professional soccer player -- may also have been involved in the squabble , though no details of his role are given .

Eventually , the American diplomatic mission in Tripoli , known then as the U.S. Liaison Office , sent a firm protest to the Libyan government .
The document states that around the same time , Mohammed Gaddafi , possibly under pressure from his sister Aisha , a family peacemaker , apparently agreed that shares owned by the Libyan Olympic Committee , which he led , would be sold to a third party .
Shortly afterward , the cable says , Mutassim 's men left the Coke plant , ending the family standoff , but not before employees of the plant received threats of bodily harm and a Gaddafi cousin was stuffed in the trunk of a car .
The Coca - Cola confrontation is among numerous tales about endless squabbling within the Gaddafi clan recounted in State Department cables .
Among other things , the incident underlines the difficulties faced by foreign companies operating in Libya even after the U.S. and United Nations began to scale back sanctions following Muammar Gaddafi 's decision in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2003" mod="END">late 2003</TIMEX3> to abandon his nuclear weapons program .
A spokesman for Coca - Cola acknowledged there had been ` ` some uncertainty '' surrounding Coke distribution arrangements in Libya during the period described in the cable .

But the problem was ` ` resolved amicably '' by <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2006" mod="END">the end of 2006</TIMEX3> , the spokesman said , and since then , Coca - Cola had been operating normally in Libya until the onset of the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> unrest .
A spokesman for the State Department said : ` ` We will decline to comment on any particular cable .
The U.S. has taken aggressive action in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> to freeze the assets of the Qaddafi family .
Thus far , more than $ 30 billion in assets have been blocked . ''
WORKERS THREATENED , PLANT MATERIALS DESTROYED Back when Libya was isolated by economic sanctions , its Coca - Cola supply was limited to consignments of the beverage bottled at a plant in Tunisia and transported to Tripoli and Benghazi .
After U.S. and international trade embargoes on Libya began to ease , the Tripoli plant was established .
It was co - owned by what the cable describes as a British company called Ka'Mur -- whose name was a reference to two embargo - era Libyan soft - drinks -- and by the Libyan Olympic Committee , headed by Mohammed Gaddafi .
Immediately after this joint venture was set up , the State Department cable says , the embargo - era Libyan distributor of bottled Coke sued the group behind the newly - opened plant , alleging breach of contract .
A complaint was also sent to Coca Cola International alleging that the bottling plant operators had ` ` stolen the franchise '' from the previous distributors , according to the cable .

The bottling plant operators counter - sued .
Then , on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2005-12-28">December 28 , 2005</TIMEX3> -- <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> after the Tripoli plant began turning out locally - bottled batches of Coke -- ` ` two military cars carrying armed personnel without clear identification illegally broke into the facility , asked the employees to leave the premises and shut down the plant , '' according to an account of the incident a businessman gave to U.S. diplomats .

The U.S. mission in Libya learned from other sources that the troops were loyal to Mutassim Gaddafi , who , after the Coca - Cola dispute was resolved , was named Libya 's national security adviser .
According to the State Department cable , Mutassim bore a grudge against his brother because he had ` ` taken over '' the embargo - era domestic soft - drink business in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="199" mod="END">the late 1990s</TIMEX3> when Mutassim had been exiled to Egypt for ` ` insubordination '' against their father .

Another cable says the ` ` rumor '' was that Mutassim had been linked to a coup attempt .
