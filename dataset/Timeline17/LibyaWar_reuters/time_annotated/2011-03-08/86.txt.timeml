Source says Gaddafi may want financial guarantees \ * Libyan leader has vowed to fight on , not to leave Libya BENGHAZI , Libya , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2011-03-08">March 8</TIMEX3>
-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Muammar Gaddafi envoy offered to hold talks on the Libyan leader 's exit but the rebel National Libyan Council rejected negotiations with a leader they do not trust , a rebel spokesman said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Arab media had reported that the Libyan leader had reached out to the council to offer talks on Gaddafi 's departure , which is the central demand of rebels who have seized swathes of the country mainly in the east from the Libyan leader 's control .
A council source on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-03-07">Monday</TIMEX3> told Reuters he had heard of a proposal that Gaddafi hand power to the head of parliament and leave Libya with a guaranteed sum of money .
He had also said the council saw the cash element as an obstacle .
In fiery and defiant speeches , Gaddafi has vowed to fight on and has told his supporters he will never leave Libya .
Officials from the council , which is based in the rebel - held eastern city of Benghazi , did not confirm any Gaddafi proposal on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-03-07">Monday</TIMEX3> , but on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-03-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> a spokesman confirmed it was made .
` ` I confirm that we received contact from a Gaddafi representative seeking to negotiate Gaddafi 's exit , '' a media officer for the council , Mustafa Gheriani , told Reuters .
` ` We rejected this .
We are not negotiating with someone who spilled Libyan blood and continues to do so .
Why would we trust the guy <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-03-08">today</TIMEX3> ? ''
The Libyan government or Gaddafi 's representatives have not issued any comment on such a proposal but his son , Saadi Gaddafi , told an Arabic channel that if the leader did step down Libya would descend into civil war .
The head of the rebel council , Mustafa Abdel Jalil , told Al Arabiya television by telephone : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the first demand is that he announces his departure , and only after that perhaps Libyans will stop pursuing him for crimes . ''
` ` There are indirect contacts with the Americans at the presidential level , '' he added , without giving details .
Al Jazeera also cited Abdel Jalil as saying that there was ` ` no chance for Gaddafi 's rule over Libya to continue '' .
It quoted an Al Jazeera correspondent saying there were talks about mediation by a foreign state to secure a safe exit for Gaddafi .
