AJDABIYAH , Libya | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Apr 17 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-04-17T19:07">7:07 pm</TIMEX3> EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels scrambled to defend their eastern frontline outpost of Ajdabiyah on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> after fighting on the coastal highway toward the oil port of Brega occupied by Muammar Gaddafi 's troops .
One witness said he saw around a dozen rockets land near the western entrance to town , which rebels wanted to use as a staging post to retake the oil port of Brega .
Many fled as loud explosions boomed across the town .
` ` There are still some guys out there at the western gate but the situation is n't very good , '' said Wassim el - Agouri , a 25 - year - old rebel volunteer waiting at Ajdabiyah 's eastern gate .
` ` We want weapons , modern weapons , '' said rebel Ayman Aswey , 21 .
` ` If we had those , we could advance against them . ''
Ajdabiyah 's streets were almost deserted by mid - afternoon and rebels barricaded the roads with concrete blocks , tree branches and anything they could find for fear of an attack .
Rebel pick - ups patrolled the streets and men took up positions across the town with machineguns and rocket - propelled grenade launchers .
Others returned to positions at the western gate with their weapons pointed west and south into the desert .
` ` We are ready for a street war .
We have got dynamite
and we ' ve got grenades , '' said rebel fighter Emtar el - Farjany , who was holding a stick of dynamite .
Some rebels on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-04-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> made it into the outskirts of Brega , 50 miles to the west , but many others retreated to Ajdabiyah after six were killed by rockets fired by Gaddafi loyalists on the exposed coastal road joining the two towns .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> , scores of volunteer fighters and civilian cars carrying men , women and children streamed east from Ajdabiyah up the coast road toward Benghazi , where the popular revolt against Gaddafi 's 41 - year rule began on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">February 17</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> marks <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> since the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorising force to protect civilians in Libya , leading to an international air campaign .
But despite NATO air strikes against Gaddafi 's armor , rebels have been unable to hold gains in weeks of back - and - forth fighting over the coastal towns in eastern Libya .
` ` From a military point of view , one can <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> see there is a stalemate , '' the head of Germany 's intelligence service Ernst Uhrlau told the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper .
` ` One can not predict at the moment how much longer Gaddafi can hold onto power .
The area around Tripoli is much stronger in terms of the population and the tribes than the east , '' he said .
In western Libya , the rebel - held city of Misrata has been under government siege for <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P7W">seven weeks</TIMEX3> , leading to a growing humanitarian crisis .
Hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed in the fighting and shelling of the city .
A rebel spokesman said Gaddafi 's forces bombarded Misrata again on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> , killing at least six people .
Abdel Basset Mezerik said at least 47 people were also wounded .
The United States , France and Britain said <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-W14">last week</TIMEX3> they would not stop bombing Gaddafi 's forces until he left power .
With NATO troops bogged down in Afghanistan , Western countries have however ruled out sending ground troops , a position reinforced by the British prime minister on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` What we ' ve said is there is no question of invasion or an occupation -- this is not about Britain putting boots on the ground , '' David Cameron told Sky News in an interview .
But he said outside powers would help in every other way to stop Gaddafi ` ` unleashing this hell on people in Misrata '' and other towns up and down the Libyan coast , including providing ` ` non - lethal equipment '' to the rebels .
European Council President Herman van Rompuy said he viewed the Libyan rebel council as ` ` a valuable discussion partner ... that embodies the Libyan people 's aspirations , '' a political vote of confidence for a force which has struggled militarily .
Earlier on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> a sandstorm obscured the flat expanse of desert stretching west from Ajdabiyah to Brega .
Rebel Ahmed al - Zuwaihi blamed the weather for a lack of NATO air strikes .
` ` The weather is no good <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">today</TIMEX3> .
NATO has n't hit anything , '' he said .
` ` It 's a big opportunity for Gaddafi and he 's taking advantage of it .
He might enter Ajdabiyah <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">today</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Today</TIMEX3> the planes are not going to hit anything . ''
NATO warplanes instead bombed the area of Al - Hira , 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- southwest of the capital Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-04-17">Sunday</TIMEX3> and also hit the city of Sirte , Libyan state television said .
Bursts of anti - aircraft fire were also heard in Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2011-04-17TEV">Sunday evening</TIMEX3> .
Days of sporadic clashes on the road west to Brega have failed to break a deadlock in the fighting .
Rebel officials said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2011-04-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> their most experienced soldiers were clashing with Gaddafi 's forces on the edge of Brega .
But the front line is hard to locate due to the hit - and - run style of fighting , long - distance shelling and the growing tendency of Gaddafi 's followers to launch flanking maneuvers and ambush less experienced rebel fighters on the coastal road .
The rebels pushed hundreds of kilometers toward the capital Tripoli in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2011-03" mod="END">late March</TIMEX3> after foreign warplanes began bombing Gaddafi 's positions to protect civilians , but proved unable to hold territory and were pushed back as far as Ajdabiyah .
In Misrata , rebels say they have faced daily bombardment from Gaddafi 's forces .
The U.S.-based rights group Human Rights Watch has also accused Gaddafi 's forces of using cluster bombs -- which scatter bomblets over a wide area , increasing civilian casualties .
The Libyan government has rejected the allegations .
A rebel spokesman , called Abdelsalam , said there was fighting around Misrata 's main thoroughfare Tripoli Street .
` ` Snipers are firing in all directions , '' he said .
` ` For <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> , it was very tough .
Gaddafi troops were launching powerful attacks .
They have been firing artillery , mortars . ''
Food was running short and long queues formed outside bakeries .
Some streets were fast becoming unrecognizable .
Hundreds of Libyans fled attacks by government forces in the mountains southwest of Tripoli and crossed into neighboring Tunisia .
The region is populated by Berbers , an ethnic group traditionally viewed with suspicion by Gaddafi 's government .
` ` I ' m part of a convoy which included about 500 people fleeing death , '' said Aissa , from the town of Nalut .
The Libyan government blames militants allied to al Qaeda for the fighting .
Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi held talks with U.N. envoy Abdelilah Al - Khatib in Tripoli and condemned ` ` the unjustified crusader colonial aggression on Libya . ''
He said Libya was ready to comply with U.N. resolutions to implement a ceasefire and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid , according to the Jana state news agency .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
The Soviets equipped with modern tanks and apache choppers in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> were also not ambushed , defeated and driven out by Afghans holding small weapons .
Tactics matters more than just hardware or sabotage .
If the Western countries stop bombing Libya , the war will be over shortly ; on the other hand , if they continue to drop their bombs , this civil war will be prolonged and there will be a humanitarian catastrophe .
There is no popular revolt against Khadafi , only a few thousand rebels armed and trained by the Western countries are fighting the Government forces .

If Great Britain , France and US really love those Libyan civilian lives , they should send their carriers and all means of transportation to bring them to their country , away from the tyrant rule of Gaddafi .
