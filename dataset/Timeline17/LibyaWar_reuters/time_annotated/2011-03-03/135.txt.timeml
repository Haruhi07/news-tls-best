Reuters -RRB- -
The international war crimes tribunal said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> it would investigate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , his sons and members of their inner circle for crimes committed by their security forces .
Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo of the Hague - based International Criminal Court , pointing to a bloody crackdown on demonstrators against Gaddafi 's rule in which thousands may have died , said that no one had the authority to massacre civilians .
He said the court would investigate ` ` serious crimes '' and had identified several people at the top of the command chain who could be investigated .
` ` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had de facto authority , '' Moreno - Ocampo said .
If opposition groups also have weapons and commit crimes , their leaders will also be investigated .
` ` We will act with impartiality , '' he said .
The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Gaddafi and his family on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> , and referred Libya 's crackdown on demonstrators to the court .
Gaddafi has vowed to stay in Libya and fight to the death since protests against his 41 - year rule began in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-02">February</TIMEX3> , inspired by the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that ousted longstanding authoritarian rulers .
The prosecutor said air strikes and attacks , alleged to have been made by security forces , and illegal detentions of hundreds of people would be investigated , including violence in the eastern city of Benghazi on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-02-15">Feb. 15</TIMEX3> and attacks in the capital Tripoli on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-02-20">Feb. 20</TIMEX3> .
` ` No one has the authority to attack and massacre civilians , '' Moreno - Ocampo said , adding that he could request the issue of arrest warrants over the atrocities in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3> ' time .
Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim called the probe ` ` close to a joke '' since no fact - finding mission had been sent to his country , and said it was based purely on media reports .
` ` We have armed gangs having tanks , aircraft and machineguns and attacking police stations , army camps , ports and airports and occupying Libyan cities .
This is far away from a peaceful movement , '' he told BBC radio .
Khaled Kaim , deputy Libyan foreign minister , told Al Arabiya ` ` We are not under the jurisdiction of the court , we are not signatories ...
The court has no power over Libya . ''
Other people in Gaddafi 's circle who will come under the court 's scrutiny include the commander of the 32nd brigade , foreign mercenaries , a government spokesman and the National Security Adviser , Moreno - Ocampo said .
He did not name them but said the inner circle included some of Gaddafi 's sons .
The 32nd brigade leader is Gaddafi 's son Khamis .
Outside that circle , he pointed to the head of Gaddafi 's personal security , the director general of the Libyan External Security Organisation , the head of the Security Forces and other organization leaders as potential suspects .
Earlier on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Gaddafi 's forces struck at rebel control of oil export hubs in eastern Libya for a second day as Arab states weighed a plan to end the turmoil .
Rebels are also calling for a no - fly zone , echoing a demand by Libya 's deputy U.N. envoy , who <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> opposes Gaddafi .
The ICC has no police force and has struggled in the past to have suspects arrested .

Former Liberian president Charles Taylor was arrested , and is <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on trial for war crimes at the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague .
Bill Pace , head of a coalition of NGOs that support the work of the court , said the Security Council and member states should <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stand by the referral and ensure that arrests are made .
` ` The involvement of the ICC indicates that crimes of grave concern will not be tolerated , '' Pace said .
