DUBAI | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Mar 3 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-03-03T24:45">12:45 pm</TIMEX3> EST DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
As Libya 's embattled leader pelts rebel strongholds with bombs near the country 's coastal oil export hubs , the risk of long - term damage to the OPEC country 's oil industry is rising .
Libya 's battle lines are shifting daily , with rebels in tenuous control of the east , but the fighting is increasingly taking place near oil industry infrastructure on the coast .
Since unrest began weeks ago in the North African country , which typically pumps around 1.6 million barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> -LRB- bpd -RRB- , around 750,000 bpd has been shut in as workers flee .
The disruptions helped push Brent crude prices to 30 - month highs <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W09">this week</TIMEX3> near $ 118 a barrel .
But so far , the conflict has spared Libya 's oil infrastructure , including its key export terminals , pipelines and well equipment , worth billions .
As the stand - off devolves into what looks increasingly like a civil war , oil experts and analysts are seeing an increasing risk of long - lasting damage to Libya 's largely foreign - run oil sector , which could keep oil prices high for a long time .
The stakes are clear .
Libya holds Africa 's largest oil reserves , and crude shipments account for 95 percent of its export revenues .
Neither Gaddafi nor rebels want to see the spoils fall into enemy hands .
European refiners , especially in Italy , rely heavily on Libya 's prized light crude .
But both the Gaddafi regime and rebels have said publicly they will not seek to destroy oil infrastructure .
No damage to oil infrastructure was reported <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-03-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> , when Gaddafi - loyal air force fighters attacked oil export hub town Brega .
The town , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> in rebel hands , has passed back and forth between regime and rebel control in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` It has become likely that Libyan fighting will affect , and potentially destroy , oil infrastructure serving the country 's largest , central Sirte basin , which is right on the fault line between Gaddafi loyalists and rebels , '' said Samuel Ciszuk , Middle East analyst at IHS Energy in London .
Gaddafi loyalists , who briefly captured Brega <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , have since been repelled back to Ras Lanuf , another major oil terminal 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of capital Tripoli .
` ` Libya 's oil infrastructure has n't been damaged .

But the risk of damage is increasing , and that could make it harder for Libya to resume oil supplies any time soon , '' said Carsten Fritsch , analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt .
And after thousands of foreign oil workers have fled the country , concerns about oilfield maintenance in the remote interior are also rising .
` ` There are really two big concerns , '' said Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas .
` ` Over the course of a shutdown of production to evacuate staff , wells have to be handled very carefully .
It 's not like turning a light bulb off and on again .
The other concern is that we will see facilities affected by the fighting . ''
The Sirte basin holds reservoirs with over 43 billion barrels of oil , which are tapped from both east and west , but it 's at risk of being cleaved down the middle .
A trunk pipeline supplies oil flows that end up both in Ras Lanuf , still under Gaddafi 's control , and terminals further east which are run by AGOCO , a unit of the state - run National Oil Company that is <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> under the control of anti - Gaddafi engineers , Ciszuk said .
AGOCO typically ships up to 450,000 bpd .
Reports in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> have shown tankers are still leaving Libya , but it 's not entirely clear who gets the revenue , Gaddafi or rebels .
Digging in its heels , AGOCO has said it may start its own marketing division to negotiate with foreign buyers .
Gaddafi - aligned oil minister Shokri Ganem , meanwhile , has claimed Libya 's oil sector remains firmly under regime control .
