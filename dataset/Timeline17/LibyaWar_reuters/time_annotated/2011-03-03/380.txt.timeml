GENEVA | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Mar 3 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-03-03T13:28">1:28 pm</TIMEX3> EST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- --
A United Nations report hailing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 's rights record was on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> sidelined by the world body 's Human Rights Council just <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a few days</TIMEX3> before it was due to be adopted .
The report , reflecting a three - hour debate in the council <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last November</TIMEX3> , included praise for Libya from a range of countries who <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-02-25">last Friday</TIMEX3> agreed that Gaddafi was a gross rights violator and backed his country 's removal from the body .
Rights activist groups said the decision by the steering bureau of the council to postpone adoption of the report would avoid embarrassment for Islamic , African and countries like Cuba who had earlier lauded Gaddafi as a democrat .
Hillel Neuer of UN Watch said the main effect of the report , compiled after a review of Libya 's record <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last November</TIMEX3> , ` ` was to bolster Gaddafi 's oppressive regime , demoralize his victims and harm the reputation of the U.N. '' U.S. ambassador to the council Eileen Donahoe said the report should not be adopted until ` ` the voices of the Libyan people , and not just the voice of the Gaddafi regime , can be reflected '' in the final text .
Gaddafi struck at rebel control of a key coastal road for a second day on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2011-03-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> but received a warning he would be held to account at an international war crimes tribunal in the Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces .
Countries who praised Libya during the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> session , part of the five - year - old council 's Universal Periodic Review -LRB- UPR -RRB- process of all U.N. member states , included Iran , Algeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , North Korea , Pakistan and Myanmar .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-02-25">last Friday</TIMEX3> several of these who are members of the council -- including Pakistan and Algeria -- supported a resolution launching an international inquiry into the ongoing crackdown on protestors and asked the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Libya 's membership in the 47 - member Geneva forum .
The General Assembly , in which all U.N. member states sit , unanimously agreed to the move on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-03-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> -- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="LESS_THAN">less than a year</TIMEX3> after three quarters of countries in the New York body had approved Libya 's accession to the rights council .
The UPR process is supposed to provide an objective review of each country 's performance in observing international rights pacts which they have signed and underpin U.N. documents like the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1948">1948</TIMEX3> Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
But critics say the process has been marked by determination among a majority council bloc of developing countries to ward off serious criticism by heaping praise on their allies -- as they do also in the council itself .
Neuer of U.N. Watch , which closely monitors the council , said it should recognize the UPR on Libya was a fraud , withdraw the report and schedule a new session in which council countries ` ` would tell the truth about the Gaddafi regime 's heinous crimes . ''
