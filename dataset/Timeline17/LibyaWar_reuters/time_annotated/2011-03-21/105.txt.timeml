Reuters -RRB- - Prime Minister David Cameron tried to reassure a war - weary public on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-03-21">Monday</TIMEX3> that Britain 's military involvement in Libya will not drag it into another Iraq - style conflict .
After a six - hour debate , parliament voted overwhelmingly to support Cameron 's decision to send British planes and ships to help enforce a no - fly zone to stop attacks on civilians by the forces of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi .
The vote was 557 - 13 , although some lawmakers voiced fears of getting dragged deeper into the Libyan conflict and others questioned why Britain had chosen to intervene in Libya but not in other crisis - hit countries .
Hanging heavy over the debate was the shadow of Iraq , where 179 British soldiers were killed in a long - running conflict after former Prime Minister Tony Blair backed then U.S. President George W. Bush 's decision to invade in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> .
` ` This is different to Iraq .
This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' Cameron said .
` ` This is about protecting people and giving the Libyan people a chance to shape their own destiny , '' he said .
Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Libya operation would be funded from a Treasury reserve and not from the defense budget , which faces a real - terms cut of 8 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next four years</TIMEX3> as part of efforts to curb a big budget deficit .
In a debate almost exactly <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">eight years ago</TIMEX3> , the British parliament gave Blair a green light to wage war on Iraq despite a massive revolt within his own party .
The 10 - month - old Conservative - Liberal Democrat coalition government has stressed that the Libya situation is very different from the Iraq war , which clouded Blair 's premiership .
Unlike the Iraq invasion , the Libya no - fly zone has been authorised by the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council resolution expressly bars occupation .
Labor leader Ed Miliband supported Cameron , saying : ` ` We have seen with our own eyes what the Libyan regime is capable of .
We ' ve seen guns being turned on unarmed demonstrators . ''
But some MPs , particularly left - wing Labor members , voiced doubts about what Britain was getting into .
` ` I ' m far from convinced that the public are behind this , '' Labor legislator Jeremy Corbyn said .
` ` They are very concerned about where it leads to because they ' ve been through the miserable experience of Iraq and they have deep concerns additionally about Afghanistan , '' he said .
Britain has 10,000 troops fighting Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan .
` ` We should n't be in there , we ' ve got enough on our plate in Afghanistan , '' said Neil Wozencroft , a 35 - year - old pipe fitter , told Reuters when asked about the Libya campaign .
` ` It 's a civil war and we should n't get involved , plus there are other atrocities in the world -- the Congo and Zimbabwe .
We ca n't be the world 's peacekeepers . ''
Conservative MP Edward Leigh called for a rethink of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> 's British defense review which he said had been a ` ` disaster . ''
The review has paved the way for sharp cuts in armed forces ' equipment and personnel .
Cameron said there was no action without risk .
` ` But ... we have to weigh the risks of inaction ...
the consequences for Europe of a failed pariah state on its southern border .
All of these , in my view , are simply too great to ignore , '' he said .
