NEW YORK | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-22">Aug 22 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2011-08-22T17:35">5:35 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - World stocks eked out a gain on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-08-22">Monday</TIMEX3> , stabilizing after <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4W">the previous four weeks</TIMEX3> of sharp losses , while Brent crude prices slipped on prospects Libya 's civil war will soon end .
U.S. stocks struggled to end barely higher , while gold , a traditional safe haven , hit a third consecutive all - time high near $ 1,900 after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2 - 1\/<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">2 years</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-W33">last week</TIMEX3> .
Sharp volatility in stocks , which has marked trading in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent weeks</TIMEX3> , underscored investor nervousness .
The turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the United States may fall back into recession , as well as the threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger economies .
The cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again , heading back toward their highest levels since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="END">late 2008</TIMEX3> as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European counterparts in the face of the intractable debt crisis .
` ` The ground zero of all worries is financials , '' said Charlie Smith , chief investment officer at Pittsburgh - based Fort Pitt Capital Group .
Bank stocks , seen as most vulnerable to the debt crisis in Europe , underperformed other sectors .
JPMorgan Chase -LRB- JPM .

Speculation is widespread in financial markets that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will use his <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-08-26">Friday</TIMEX3> speech at a central banker conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , to signal a new monetary offensive to support the faltering U.S. economy .
That helped support stocks and gold but weigh on U.S. bond prices .
Bernanke , however , is most likely to outline gradualist measures , which would disappoint those looking for a big - bang approach such as a fresh round of bond buying , known as QE3 .
The Fed chairman looks set to discuss ways the central bank could tweak the Fed 's balance sheet as a means to put further pressure on medium and long - term interest rates and anchor them at low levels .
These could be implemented in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-09">September</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> at coming Fed meetings .
` ` The Fed is definitely on people 's minds , and you could argue that some of the bounce seen in high - yield commodity currencies is at least in part related to hopes for more policy measures , '' said Wells Fargo strategist Vassili Serebriakov in New York .
