Full Article Gaddafi forces fire Scud missile : U.S. official BENGHAZI , Libya | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Aug 16 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-08-16T17:46">5:46 pm</TIMEX3> IST BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi fired a Scud missile for the first time in the country 's civil war , a U.S. defense official said , after rebel advances left the Libyan leader isolated in his capital .
Rebels fighting to end Gaddafi 's 41 - year rule seized two strategic towns near Tripoli <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two days</TIMEX3> , cutting the city off from its supply lines and leaving the Libyan leader with a dwindling set of options if he is to stay in power .
However , pro - Gaddafi forces were encountering a fight - back in one of those towns , Zawiyah , west of Tripoli .
A Reuters reporter nearby said he heard a salvo of four Russian - made Grad rockets landing in the town on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The Scud missile was fired on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-08-14TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3> from a location about 50 miles -LRB- 80 km -RRB- east of Sirte , Gaddafi 's home town , and landed east of the coastal oil town of Brega where rebels are fighting for control , the U.S. official said .
The missile came down in the desert , injuring no one , said the official , who was speaking on condition of anonymity .
There was no immediate comment from the government in Tripoli .
Firing the missile , which poses little military threat because it is so inaccurate , is evidence of the Gaddafi administration 's desperation , said Shashank Joshi , Associate Fellow at Britain 's Royal United Services Institute .
` ` It 's an obvious sign that the regime 's back is to the wall , '' he said .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the six months</TIMEX3> of fighting up to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , Gaddafi 's forces have been using short - range Grad rockets but have not before deployed Scud missiles , which have an estimated range of about 185 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- .
In the rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Benghazi , officials said the Scud firing was a sign Gaddafi would do anything to protect his power .
` ` Gaddafi troops are using his last gun .
He 's crazy , '' said Mohammad Zawawi , media director for rebel forces .
` ` We 're scared he 'll use chemicals .
That 's why we 're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the least number of casualties . ''
` ` We ca n't prevent the scuds
but we hope NATO can .
NATO has the technology to detect them . ''
Analysts say the rebels ' strategy <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse , but they say it is possible too that Gaddafi will opt to stage a last - ditch fight for the capital .
In a barely audible telephone call to state television in the early hours of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2011-08-15TMO">Monday morning</TIMEX3> , Gaddafi called on his followers to liberate Libya from rebels and their NATO supporters .
` ` Get ready for the fight ...
The blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield , '' he said .
He was speaking as rebels made their most dramatic advances in months of fighting , shifting the momentum in a conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of NATO powers anxious for a swift outcome .
Rebel forces in the Western Mountains south of Tripoli surged forward at <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2011-W32-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> to enter Zawiyah .
The town is about 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and , crucially , straddles the main highway linking the capital to Tunisia .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> later , rebels said they had captured the town of Garyan , which controls the highway leading south from Tripoli and linking it to Sabha , a Gaddafi stronghold deep in the desert .
` ` Gaddafi has been isolated .
He has been cut off from the outside world , '' a rebel spokesman from the Western Mountains , called Abdulrahman , told Reuters by telephone .
Early on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , rebels on the outskirts of Zawiyah said forces loyal to Gaddafi were still on the eastern edge of the town , from where they have been attacking with mortars , Grad rockets and sniper fire .
Medical workers at one of the town 's hospitals said 20 people , a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians , were killed on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011-08-15">Monday</TIMEX3> , and the death toll for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> had reached one .
Officials in Tripoli deny Zawiyah is under rebel control , but government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim acknowledged on state television that rebel fighters were in Garyan .
` ` There are still armed gangs inside the city .
We are able to drive them out , '' he said .
A U.N. envoy arrived in neighbouring Tunisia , where sources say rebels and representatives of the government have been holed up on the island resort of Djerba for negotiations .
Tunisia 's official news agency on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-08-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> quoted the envoy , Abdel Elah al - Khatib , as saying he knew nothing of any negotiations in Djerba .
Speaking in Tunis , he said he held informal talks with representatives of Gaddafi 's government and the rebel council .
The envoy did not say who they were or what they discussed .
Gaddafi 's spokesman denied Tripoli was in talks about the leader 's departure , saying reports of such negotiations were the product of a ` ` media war '' being waged against Libya .
Talks could signal the endgame of a civil war that has drawn in the NATO alliance and emerged as one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the Arab world .
Rebels may still lack the manpower for an all - out assault on Tripoli , but are hoping their encirclement of the capital will bring down Gaddafi 's government or inspire an uprising .
In the past , however , they have frequently failed to hold gains , and a fightback by Gaddafi troops could yet force them back .
Pro - Gaddafi residents of the capital remain defiant .
Makhjoub Muftah , a school teacher who has signed up as a gun - toting pro - Gaddafi volunteer , like many others seemed to think a rebel advance into Tripoli was a remote possibility .
` ` I wish they would march into Tripoli .
I wish , '' he said , daring the rebels .
` ` They will all die . ''
