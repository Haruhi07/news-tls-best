BENGHAZI , Libya | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2011-08-04">Aug 4 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2011-08-04T15:51">3:51 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BENGHAZI , Libya -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - ` ` The rebels '' is a handy phrase -- but in reality there are about 40 different rebel groups and freelance militias fighting to end the long reign of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi , and it shows .
Some fight Gaddafi 's troops on the front line while others handle security in rebel - held cities .
And , in a country flooded with weapons , some gunmen are simply helping themselves to whatever they want , members of the armed opposition say .
The still unexplained killing of top rebel commander General Abdul Fattah Younes <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2011-W30">last week</TIMEX3> raised doubts about the loyalty to the rebel cause of some fighters .
Gaddafi 's son Saif al - Islam has done his best to exploit differences within the opposition , telling the New York Times he had made contact with Islamists among the rebels , and that a government - Islamist alliance would be announced within days .
He said he had been in contact with an Islamist rebel leader , Ali Sallabi -- who was quoted by the New York Times as acknowledging the contacts but as saying he remained allied with the liberal rebels trying to oust Gaddafi .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> the brigades and armed groups are too many .
Every neighborhood has one , '' said rebel fighter Yasser .
` ` Some people use the weapons for crime and theft . ''
` ` Everyone knows how to use a gun , '' he said .
` ` The Libyans are an armed people .
Even my mother knows guns . ''
Yasser 's brigade is officially recognized by the higher rebel authorities .
It was raised in Benghazi by a handful of young men who took up guns to protect the neighborhood against Gaddafi forces and criminals , and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> numbers over 100 fighters .
As the civil war enters its sixth month , armed groups roam the streets in the rebel stronghold , raising fears of creeping lawlessness .
They drive around in pickups , firing their assault rifles into the air .
It is not always clear to which group they belong or whether it is approved by the National Transitional Council , recognized by some Western powers as Libya 's legitimate government .
` ` In my neighborhood there are groups who guard the area , they are not officially organised , but they have guns , '' said a rebel official .
` ` Anybody can go to the front and fight .
It is easy to get a gun .
If I take my AK-47 and want to fight on the front line , no one can stop me . ''
Benghazi resident Essa , a steel worker before the war , proudly shows a video of 7 rocket - propelled grenade launchers made in his workshop from army weapons parts .
The RPGs were used against Gaddafi 's troops on the western front in Misrata .
Others put their military loot to questionable use .
Dull explosions echo round Benghazi harbor as fishermen detonate explosives in the sea for a quick catch .
U.S. officials say they are worried about reports that al Qaeda may already be smuggling arms and explosives out of Libya .
A United Nations official draws a parallel with the mayhem in Iraq after the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> U.S. invasion and the fall of Saddam .
` ` We kept telling them in Iraq that they have to secure the -LRB- weapons -RRB- stores , but no one listened , '' he said .
` ` Next we would see these weapons being smuggled across the border to Iran . ''
The Mahdi Army of anti - American Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr started as a neighborhood protection force , but grew quickly in strength and was later blamed for much of the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2007">07</TIMEX3> sectarian slaughter that drove Iraq to the brink of civil war .
The killing of Younes has raised similar concerns here .
Some rebel sources say it was the work of Islamist militiamen in the rebel ranks , and exposed the opposition to the risk of a split that could spark a tribal feud .
Armed groups such as Obaida Ibn Jarrah and Okbah Ibn Nafih brigades have been named as possible perpetrators .
Both are named after companions of the Prophet Mohammad .
Some say Gaddafi loyalists were obviously behind the killing of Younes , who defected after holding top government posts for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> -- including that of interior minister , which would have put him at odds with Islamist opponents of Gaddafi .
Younes 's tribe has sworn to get justice itself if the rebel leaders fail to investigate his death and catch his killers .
His death was followed by a prison break by some 300 Gaddafi loyalists and a battle between rebels and the militia who helped the prisoners to escape in the center of Benghazi .
The militiamen belong to a group called Nedaa Libya , or Libya 's Call , which is not an official force under rebel authority .
Fighters in Benghazi who know them never thought they might be Gaddafi loyalists until the prison break .
` ` We heard about them before but did n't know they were fifth columnists , '' said Faraj al - Sharif , a rebel fighter from the Martyrs of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011-02-17">February 17th</TIMEX3> brigade .
He estimates their number at 1,000 fighters , many of them still at large .
` ` Every time we ask them to surrender , they stop for a while then they start firing at us and shout Allah , Muammar , Libya and that 's all , '' he said .
Benghazi residents <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> talk of Gaddafi ` ` sleeper cells '' in guerrilla ranks and mistrust is spreading among the locals , who treat everyone with suspicion .
Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul - Jalil , trying to soothe public anger and avert a feud , urged militias to lay down their arms or come under the orders of the Defense or Interior ministries .
It remains unclear how he can follow up such exhortations .
