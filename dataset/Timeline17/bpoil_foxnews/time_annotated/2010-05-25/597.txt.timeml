<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">May 23</TIMEX3> : An oil - covered pelican flaps its wings on an island in Barataria Bay off the coast of Louisiana .
AP2010 WASHINGTON --
Responding to the massive BP oil spill , Congress is getting ready to quadruple -- to 32 cents a barrel -- a tax on oil used to help finance cleanups .
The increase would raise nearly $ 11 billion over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="202">the next decade</TIMEX3> .
The tax is levied on oil produced in the U.S. or imported from foreign countries .
The revenue goes to a fund managed by the Coast Guard to help pay to clean up spills in waterways , such as the Gulf of Mexico .
The tax increase is part of a larger bill that has grown into a nearly $ 200 billion grab bag of unfinished business that lawmakers hope to complete before <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-31">Memorial Day</TIMEX3> .
The key provisions are a one - year extension of about 50 popular tax breaks that expired at <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="END">the end of last year</TIMEX3> , and expanded unemployment benefits , including subsidies for health insurance , through the end of the year .
The House could vote on the bill as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , though Democrats were still working <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> to round up the votes .
Democratic leaders had wanted to hold a vote <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
There has been little public opposition to the oil tax from the petroleum industry .
But the overall bill would add about $ 134 billion to the federal budget deficit , drawing opposition from Republicans and some Democrats .
Senate leaders hope to complete work on the bill before Congress goes on a weeklong break <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">next week</TIMEX3> .
The Obama administration issued a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> supporting the bill .
Lawmakers want to increase the <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> 8 - cent - a - barrel tax on oil to make sure there is enough money available to respond to oil spills .
At least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> off the Louisiana coast .
President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have said they expect BP to foot the bill for the cleanup .
` ` Taxpayers will not pick up the tab , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev .
BP executives told Congress <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> they would pay ` ` all legitimate claims '' for damages .
But the government needs upfront money to respond to spills , as well as money to pay for cleanups when the responsible party is unable to pay , or is unknown .
Money spent from the fund can later be recovered from the company responsible for the spill .
The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has about $ 1.5 billion available .
Under <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> law , only $ 1 billion can be spent from the fund on a single incident .
The bill would increase the spending limit to $ 5 billion .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the tax increase was hastily put together , without adequate study , to help pay for an unrelated bill .
The tax increase was unveiled <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> , without any congressional hearings to study its impact .
` ` I have seen no analysis on how this would impact energy security , how this would impact domestic production , how this would impact the overall economics in the country , '' said Christopher Guith , vice president of the chamber 's energy institute .
` ` There has n't been any sort of deliberation on this . ''
Guith said the tax could be passed on to consumers , depending on the ability of oil companies to raise gas prices in response to a tax increase .
Lawmakers felt the tax increase , to 32 cents a barrel , was reasonable , said Rep. Sander Levin , D - Mich .
, chairman of the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee .
` ` We just decided to take a look at what we thought would be a reasonable increase , '' Levin said .
The American Petroleum Institute has not taken a position on the tax increase , though a spokeswoman said Congress should study the ramifications before acting .
` ` We understand we need to have an insurance policy in order to cover people in the event of a spill , '' said the spokeswoman , Cathy Landry .
` ` At the same time we need to have a vital oil and gas industry . ''
The bill does not address a federal law that caps liability at $ 75 million for economic damages beyond direct cleanup costs .
Democratic Senators tried to pass a bill <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> that would have increased the cap to $ 10 billion , but they were blocked by Republicans .
The oil industry says such a high cap would make it difficult , if not impossible , to insure oil rigs .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million .
