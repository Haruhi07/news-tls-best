NEW ORLEANS --
No oil appeared to be leaking from a drilling rig that exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico , the Coast Guard said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04-23">Friday</TIMEX3> , though officials were trying to contain what spilled after the blast and prevent any threat to the coast 's fragile ecosystem .
The search continued for 11 workers missing after the explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20" mod="END">late Tuesday</TIMEX3> on the Deepwater Horizon , though family members said they had been told they probably did not survive .
The rig burned for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly two days</TIMEX3> until it sank <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-04-22TMO">Thursday morning</TIMEX3> .
The fire was out , but officials initially feared as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below .
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-04-23TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> that no oil appeared to be leaking from a well head at the ocean floor , nor was any leaking at the water 's surface .
But she said crews were closely monitoring the rig for any more crude that might spill out .
The crew was finishing the well about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast when the rig exploded .
Officials have not said what caused the blast , and the oil they are dealing with <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is left over from the explosion and sinking .
` ` If it gets landward , it could be a disaster in the making , '' said Cynthia Sarthou , executive director for the environmental group Gulf Restoration Network .
BP PLC , which leased the rig and took the lead in the cleanup , said <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04-23">Friday</TIMEX3> it has activated an extensive oil spill response , including using remotely operated vehicles to assess the well and 32 vessels to mop up the spill .
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company will do ` ` everything in our power to contain this oil spill and resolve the situation as rapidly , safely and effectively as possible . ''
Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor , said he expects some of the light crude oil to evaporate while much of it turns into a pasty mess that ultimately breaks apart into small chunks of oily residue that can wash ashore .
` ` It 's going to be a god - awful mess for a while , '' he said .
` ` I ' m not crying doomsday or saying the sky is falling , but that is the potential . ''
Weather forecasts indicate the spill was likely to stay well away from shore at least through <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-W15-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , but if winds change it could come ashore faster , said Doug Helton of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's office of response and restoration .
The Coast Guard , which was leading the investigation , had not given up the search <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04-23" mod="START">early Friday</TIMEX3> for those missing from the rig .
Carolyn Kemp of Monterey , La. , said her grandson , Roy Wyatt Kemp , 27 , would have been on the drilling platform when it exploded .
` ` They 're assuming all those men who were on the platform are dead , '' Kemp said .
` ` That 's the last we ' ve heard . ''
Most of the crew -- 111 members -- were ashore , including 17 taken to hospitals .
Four were in critical condition .
Four others made it off safely were still on a boat operating one of several underwater robots being used to assess whether the flow of oil could be shut off at a control valve on the sea floor , said Guy Cantwell , spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. .
Landry said crews saw a 1 - mile - by-5 - mile rainbow sheen of what appeared to be a crude oil mix on the surface .
At the worst - case figure of 336,000 gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> for the amount of crude oil spilled to equal the 11 million gallons spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound .

A turn in winds and currents might send oil toward fragile coastal wetlands -- nurseries for fish and shrimp and habitat for birds .
` ` As you get closer to shore , you get richer and richer marine habitats , and also get the potential for long - term exposure , '' Helton said .
To prevent that , the Marine Spill Response Corp. , an energy industry cleanup consortium , brought seven skimmer boats to suck oily water from the surface , four planes that can scatter chemicals to disperse oil , and 500,000 feet -- 94.6 miles -- of containment boom , a floating barrier with a skirt that drapes down under the water and corrals the oil .
In addition to other environmental concerns , the well is in an area where a pod of sperm whales is known to feed , said Kim Amendola of NOAA .
Those who escaped the rig did so mainly by getting on lifeboats that were lowered into the Gulf , said Adrian Rose , vice president of Transocean .
` ` There are a number of uncorroborated stories , a lot of them really quite heroic stories , of how people looked after each other .
There was very little panic , '' Rose said .
Family members of two missing workers filed separate lawsuits <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> accusing Transocean and BP of negligence .
Both companies declined to comment about legal action against them after the first suit was filed .
The U.S. Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs , conducted three routine inspections of the Deepwater Horizon <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> -- in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> and on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-04-01">April 1</TIMEX3> -- and found no violations , MMS spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said .
