It took U.S. and British teams <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> to cap the well in the BP oil spill .
A Florida lawmaker does n't want to find out how long it would take Cuba to cap a similar catastrophe .
Rep. Vern Buchanan , a Republican who represents part of Florida 's western coast , has introduced a bill aimed at blocking Cuba from drilling a new deepwater oil well in the waters off its northern coast .
Citing threats to his state 's tourism industry and environment in the event of a potential oil spill , Buchanan has expressed concern that the communist country -- and the Spanish company it has contracted for running the Chinese - built rig -- would be incapable of handling the kind of disaster spill that strained U.S. response teams <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-SP">last spring</TIMEX3> .
The proposal would treat Cuba 's drilling industry kind of like Iran 's sanctioned energy sector .
It would empower the U.S. interior secretary to deny an oil - and - gas lease , or exploration permit , to any company dealing with a country under U.S. sanction or embargo .
Though vague , the language is directed at Spanish oil - and - gas firm Repsol , which is heading up Cuba 's new oil plans .
The issue troubling Buchanan is that Cuba is looking to drill for oil even deeper than BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last April</TIMEX3> and sent millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf .
Not only would Cuba 's well be deeper -- at 5,600 feet compared to 5,000 feet -- but Buchanan said it would be at the edge of Cuba 's territorial waters , 50 miles from the Florida coast .
` ` As we have learned from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , an oil spill can devastate a regional economy and impose serious long - term environment damage to precious natural resources , '' he said in a written statement .
In the event of a spill , he said , ` ` quickly capping the well would be extremely difficult , if not impossible . ''
Buchanan said the hypothetical oil slick would take ` ` just <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> '' to reach Florida 's beaches , which drives its tourism economy .
Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman called the bill ` ` very time sensitive , '' with drilling slated to begin within <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .
His office suggested Cuba 's government could not be counted on to clean up another mega - spill .
Asked whether Repsol would be able to step in , Repsol representative Kristian Rix told FoxNews.com the company ` ` adheres to the strictest safety measures '' and develops ` ` comprehensive accident response plans '' in every country where it does business .
` ` We have every confidence that our teams and equipment are well prepared to carry out operations safely and effectively , '' Rix , the firm 's international and financial media manager , said in an e - mail .
A Spanish court began an investigation <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> into a spill at one of Repsol 's Mediterranean rigs , though that leak was not anywhere near as colossal as the BP spill .
For the new rig , the United States could not directly block Cuba from drilling in its own waters .
But under Buchanan 's bill the U.S. could threaten Repsol 's projects elsewhere in U.S. territory .
The company operates rigs near Texas and Louisiana .
With his bill , Buchanan wants to compel Repsol to abandon the Cuba drilling to protect its other assets .
The company earlier backed off a natural gas project in Iran after facing pressure from the United States over Iran 's nuclear program .
Buchanan 's not the only prominent Floridian to warn about the danger of new international drilling near the Sunshine State 's shores .
Former Sen. Bob Graham warned in a speech <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-14">Jan. 14</TIMEX3> that Cuba is planning other drilling projects with a Russian firm .
According to an account of the speech in The Miami Herald , Graham said the United States should partner with Mexico to draft new international drilling safety standards in the Gulf .
In addition , he said , Mexico should press Cuba to impose such standards .
Graham said the BP spill should be a ` ` wake - up call . ''
The BP spill dumped an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf , hammering the coastline and offshore waters as well as the region 's fishing and tourism economies .
Florida 's $ 60 billion - a - year tourism industry stood to suffer the most .
A report put out <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">last summer</TIMEX3> by the U.S. Travel Association said Florida 's losses <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next three years</TIMEX3> could amount to nearly $ 19 billion .
Buchanan last expressed concerns about the Cuba project in a letter to President Obama in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> .
His bill has so far attracted just two co - sponsors -- both Florida Republicans -- but Goodman said the congressman is seeking bipartisan support .
The Interior Department had no comment when asked <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-01-24">Monday</TIMEX3> whether Secretary Ken Salazar was interested in attaining or exercising the authority Buchanan wants to give him .
