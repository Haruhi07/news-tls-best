This image from video provided by BP shows oil gushing from the broken wellhead at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico .
AP BP officials on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-08-06">Friday</TIMEX3> left open the door to someday drilling again into the same lucrative undersea pocket of oil that spilled millions of gallons of crude , wrecked livelihoods and fouled beaches along the Gulf of Mexico -- and , for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , the Obama administration is n't shooting the idea down either .
The Interior Department would only go as far as to say that BP would n't regain access to the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - capped well that began gushing oil after the deadly <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion at a company - run rig off Louisiana .
` ` The well is almost dead .
Under no circumstances are we going to allow them to reopen the well to extract oil and gas from the Macondo well , '' Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff told FoxNews.com .
But BP may be interested in the vast oil reservoir beneath the blown well that is still believed to hold nearly $ 4 billion worth of crude .
With the company and its partners facing tens of billions of dollars in liabilities , the incentive to exploit the wells and the reservoir could grow .
` ` There 's lots of oil and gas here , '' Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said at a news briefing <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-08-06">Friday</TIMEX3> when asked about the possibility .
` ` We 're going to have to think about what to do with that at some point . ''
BP spokesman Daren Beaudo emphasized to FoxNews.com that the company has no plans to develop the reservoir .
` ` We 're focused 100 percent on the job at hand , which is killing the well , cleaning up the oil and restoring the Gulf Coast economy , '' he said .
Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill , said he had no information on BP 's future plans .
` ` I would assume that 's a policy issue related to the management of the lease , '' he told reporters .
` ` Frankly , it has n't been raised to my level at this point .
I ' m not sure I can comment on it . ''
A senior official with the Interior Department told FoxNews.com that the agency has had no communications with BP about drilling in the reservoir .
` ` It is too premature to talk or even speculate about them drilling there , '' the official said .
Suttles has spent <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three months</TIMEX3> managing BP 's response efforts on the Gulf but is <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> returning to his day job in Houston , the company said .
Mike Utsler , a vice president who has been running BP 's command post in Houma , La. , since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , will replace him .
The personnel shift comes as BP appears to be gaining the upper hand on plugging the leak .
Engineers <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W31">this week</TIMEX3> poured in cement to complete a plug at the top of the well bore as part of a process dubbed a ` ` static kill , '' but they needed to wait <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a day</TIMEX3> for the cement to harden .
Once it does , crews can finish the last stretch of a relief well intersecting the blown well just above the oil 's source , injecting more mud and cement from the bottom to form a final plug .
Suttles confirmed <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-08-06">Friday</TIMEX3> that crews for <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> plan to use the 18,000 - foot relief well to seal off with mud and cement the underground reservoir feeding the blown well .
The company had been hedging on how exactly it would use the relief well , which it has been digging for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> , as federal officials insisted it should be used to perform the so - called ` ` bottom kill . ''
If not used for the bottom kill , the relief wells could have conceivably offered a way for BP or another company to pump oil from the reservoir and sell it , an idea unlikely to sit well with Gulf Coast residents and families of workers who died on the rig .
The static kill started <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-08-03">Tuesday</TIMEX3> with engineers pumping enough mud down the top of the well to push the crude back to its underground source .
Suttles said engineers plan to monitor the cement newly pumped in from the top and test the plug to make sure it 's sealed .
` ` All the indications so far look very encouraging , '' he said .
A federal report <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-W31">this week</TIMEX3> indicated that only about a quarter of the spilled crude remains in the Gulf and is degrading quickly .
` ` There 's essentially no skimmable oil left on the surface , no recoverable oil left on the surface , '' Suttles said .
Some scientists disputed the report 's veracity , and much of the remaining crude has permeated deep into marshes and wetlands , complicating cleanup .
BP had 31,000 workers along the Gulf on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-08-06">Friday</TIMEX3> , down from 48,000 at the height of the response , Suttles said .
As BP pulled brought in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1933">33</TIMEX3> - year employee Utsler to take over the response and the blown well appeared to have flatlined , some Gulf residents who still see the oil wreaking havoc worried the nation 's attention was shifting .
Utsler told them not to worry , saying the spill 's effects are ` ` a challenge that we continue to recognize with more than 20,000 - plus people continuing to work . ''
Willie Davis , a 41 - year - old harbormaster in Pass Christian , Miss. , feared his area would be forgotten if BP pulls out too soon .
` ` I ' m losing trust in the whole system , '' Davis said .
` ` If they do n't get up off their behinds and do something <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , it 's gon na be years before we 're back whole again . ''
