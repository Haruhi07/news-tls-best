MIAMI -- BP PLC and the other companies involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill are faced with fast - multiplying lawsuits that will provoke one of the most drawn - out and costliest legal battles in U.S. history , one that could easily consume the $ 20 billion set aside by BP to pay for the disaster , according to legal experts and attorneys nationwide .
One veteran complex litigation attorney estimated that unless there is a quick settlement that satisfies all sides , it will be <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2015">2015</TIMEX3> before any trials begin and at least <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2028">2028</TIMEX3> before appeals and other legal issues are fully resolved .
The attorney , Lela Hollabaugh of Nashville , Tenn. , pointed out that it took <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> to complete all claims from the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska .
` ` When you 're looking at an incident like this , which has so many different parties in different states , you just simply ca n't get through the litigation quickly , ''
Hollabaugh said .
` ` It just takes a long time to move through the process . ''
So far , at least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the nation 's worst - ever offshore oil spill .
Virtually every lawsuit names as defendants BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. , well contractor Halliburton Co. and Cameron International , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer .
The plaintiffs make up the entire mosaic of the Gulf Coast : shrimpers and oystermen , charter boat captains , beach resort and condo owners , restaurants and bars , seafood suppliers , bait and tackle shops , even tourist attractions like Key West 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum .
Most of the parties claim severe economic losses from the oil spill , ranging from the fish they can no longer catch to tourists who never arrived to rent rooms .
There are also a few wrongful death and injury lawsuits filed , mainly in state courts , by workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion and relatives of some of the 11 men who died .
And some BP investors also have sued , claiming the company 's mistakes led to a sharp drop in its stock price .
A federal judicial panel is meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of the lawsuits for pretrial decisions before a single judge , a development that most observers say is a foregone conclusion .
BP and the other companies favor federal court in Houston -- near their major U.S. operations -- while a majority of plaintiffs ' attorneys have suggested New Orleans , closer to the broken well and to many of the hardest - hit victims .
Courts in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama also are being suggested as venues .
It 's difficult to estimate potential damages that BP could be forced to pay , or what shape a settlement might take .
But legal experts say BP alone is looking at some $ 2 billion in costs just to defend itself , with the $ 20 billion fund set aside to pay oil spill claims and cleanup costs potentially not enough to foot the entire bill .
` ` There 's no way it 's going to be enough , '' said Victor Diaz , a Miami attorney experienced in similar large - scale cases such as those involving faulty Chinese drywall .
` ` We still do n't know what will happen later , what the second and third wave of damages might be .
What happens if <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01">six months later</TIMEX3> , some fish species is wiped out ? ''
One example of post - spill lawsuits : the owners of a Louisiana shrimp boat claim in a new lawsuit they are suffering health problems including headaches , nausea and shortness of breath after working for BP in the collecting and burning of oil in the Gulf .
BP 's liability is already larger than the Exxon Valdez case , which ultimately led to a $ 500 million payout to affected fishermen and residents .
Other large ` ` mass tort '' cases include drug maker Merck & Co. 's agreement in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> to a $ 4.85 billion settlement of some 50,000 cases stemming from its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx .
Also , Pharmaceutical company Wyeth initially settled claims over its diet drug fen - phen for $ 3.75 billion in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> , but that soared to more than $ 21 billion by <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> as more claims were filed .
Asbestos , which has caused widespread lung disease and other ailments , is the longest - running mass lawsuit case in U.S. history , costing a variety of companies more than $ 70 billion and involving more than 730,000 claims since <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Rand Corp. .
And tobacco companies have been slapped with thousands of lawsuits over the dangers of cigarette smoking .
They won most of them until the major companies agreed in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> to a 25 - year , $ 206 billion settlement with 46 states who sued over the costs to their health programs .
The BP case will differ in many ways from those involving drug companies , automakers and asbestos manufacturers , where people died or suffered illnesses directly caused by the product .
In an oil spill , oystermen whose beds were choked off by oil might have relatively easy claims to prove , but what about a beachfront hotelier whose business fell off , or a property owner whose house may suddenly be worth much less ?
` ` People who have those indirect claims are going to have a difficult time under any situation , ''
Hollabaugh said .
` ` Where does it end ?
You could say the oil spill has harmed our whole country . ''
Many of the lawsuits are proposed class actions , in which a plaintiff such as a commercial fisherman or a property owner seeks to represent everyone else in the same situation .
One task for the judge appointed to preside over the consolidated cases is sorting out which of those overlap , and which should be deemed class actions .
One wild card is the claims process created by BP and President Barack Obama 's administration .
That process , administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , promises oil spill victims quicker access to money for what BP calls ` ` legitimate '' claims than the traditional legal process .
Feinberg is touting the plan as a generous alternative to a lawsuit , telling one audience in Washington that although legal action remains an option , ` ` You 're crazy to do so . ''
Feinberg made similar arguments in convincing most survivors and victims ' families to join the federal 9\/11 compensation fund rather than sue airlines or other companies individually over the terror attacks .
Some plaintiffs ' attorneys have raised questions about how the claims process can guarantee a fair result .

But Howard Erichson , a law professor at Fordham University , said people also are taking their chances with the court system .
` ` Litigation is expensive , it 's time - consuming , it is unpredictable , '' Erichson said .
` ` The results often vary in unpredictable ways .
Plaintiffs in mass tort litigation end up losing a lot of the money to legal fees and expenses .
If the compensation fund is fair , I ' m all for it . ''
Another unknown is whether BP and the other Deepwater Horizon companies will work together to defend themselves or sue each other .
Much depends on the outcome of a Justice Department criminal investigation that could point the finger more heavily at one or the other ; Transocean is already asking a federal judge in Houston to limit its liability to $ 27 million under <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1CE">a century</TIMEX3> - old law meant to cut losses for shipping companies when vessels like the floating Deepwater Horizon rig are sunk .
Somewhat forgotten in all the economic litigation are the rig victims and their families .
Michelle Jones , the wife of lost rig worker Gordon Jones , wants to keep her lawsuit separate so it does not get lost in the shuffle .
` ` While the damages incurred by the fishermen and property owners is significant , the stakes in Jones ' case involves everyday living expenses and the education costs for her two children , '' Michelle Jones ' attorney wrote in a federal court filing .
` ` After losing her husband , and her sons losing their father , she may have to wait years . ''
