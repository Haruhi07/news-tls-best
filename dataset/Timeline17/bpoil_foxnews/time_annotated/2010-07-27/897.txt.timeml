The Coast Guard is responding to a new oil leak on the Gulf Coast .
This spill involves a well in a portion of Barataria Bay known as Mud Lake , near Bayou St. Dennis about 10 miles south of Lafitte , Louisiana .
Although this latest spill is unrelated to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , it 's blocking vessels of opportunity based in Lafitte from accessing the Gulf , as officials assess air quality and other health and safety issues at the site .
-LRB- Boats staged in other areas are unaffected -RRB- .
` ` It 's apparent that some type of vessel has hit the well head , has laid it over , '' said Donald Nalty , COO of oil spill cleanup contractor ES&H , who just returned from a flyover of the site in single engine seaplane .
` ` It 's probably about a four inch casing and it 's spewing out oil and natural gas . ''
Nalty said the oil was coming out as a mist and was dusting nearby marshes .
