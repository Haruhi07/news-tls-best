AP -RRB- -- BP 's top lobbyist says the company does not view a $ 75 million federal cap on economic damages for oil spills as a limit to its obligations to people along the Gulf Coast .
David Nagel , head of the company 's Washington office , said BP has so far paid $ 3.5 million in damage claims beyond cleanup costs .
He said the company has received 4,700 claims so far and paid on 295 of them .
