<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> :
Contract workers from BP ferry oil - soaked waste in a marsh near Pass a Loutre , La. <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> Getty Images PORT FOURCHON , La. -- As submersible robots made another risky attempt to control the underwater Gulf oil gusher , the crude on the surface spread , closing in on Florida .
BP 's stock plummeted and took much of the market down with it , and the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the spill .
The stakes could n't be higher .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6W">six weeks</TIMEX3> of failures to block the well or divert the oil , the latest mission involved using a set of tools akin to an oversized deli slicer and garden shears to break away the broken riser pipe so engineers can then position a cap over the well 's opening .
But it 's a big gamble : Even if it succeeds , it will temporarily increase the flow of an already massive leak by 20 percent -- at least 100,000 gallons more <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
That 's on top of the estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons gushing out already .
In Florida , officials confirmed an oil sheen about nine miles from the famous white sands of Pensacola beach .
Crews shored up miles of boom and prepared for the mess to make landfall as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` It 's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches , '' said Keith Wilkins , deputy chief of neighborhood and community services for Escambia County .
Florida would be the fourth state hit .
Crude has already been reported along barrier islands in Alabama and Mississippi , and it has impacted some 125 miles of Louisiana coastline .
More federal fishing waters were closed , too , another setback for one of the region 's most important industries .
More than one - third of federal waters were off - limits for fishing , along with hundreds of square miles of state waters .
Fisherman Hong Le , who came to the U.S. from Vietnam , had rebuilt his home and business after Hurricane Katrina wiped him out .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> he 's facing a similiar situation .
` ` I ' m going to be bankrupt very soon , '' Le , 53 , said as he attended a meeting for fishermen hoping for help .
` ` Everything is financed , how can I pay ?

No fishing , no welding .
I weld on commercial fishing boats and they are n't going out <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , so nothing breaks . ''
Le , like other of the fishermen , received $ 5,000 from BP PLC , but it was quickly gone .
` ` I call that ` Shut your mouth money , '' ' said Murray Volk , 46 , of Empire , who 's been fishing for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P30Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 30 years</TIMEX3> .
` ` That wo n't pay the insurance on my boat and house .
They say there 'll be more later , but do you think the electric company will wait for that ? ''
BP may have bigger problems , though .
Attorney General Eric Holder , who visited the Gulf on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> to survey the fragile coastline and meet with state and federal prosecutors , would not say who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
` ` We will closely examine the actions of those involved in the spill .
If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said in New Orleans .
The federal government also ramped up its response to the spill with President Barack Obama ordering the co - chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster , ` ` to follow the facts wherever they lead , without fear or favor . ''
The president said that if laws are insufficient , they 'll be changed .
He said that if government oversight was n't tough enough , that will change , too .
BP 's stock nose - dived on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , losing nearly 15 percent of its value on the first trading day since the previous best option -- the so - called top kill -- failed and was aborted at the government 's direction .
It dipped steeply with Holder 's late - afternoon announcement , which also sent other energy stocks tumbling , ultimately causing the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 112 .
If BP 's new effort to contain the leak fails , the procedure will have made the biggest oil spill in U.S. history even worse .
` ` It is an engineer 's nightmare , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences .
` ` They 're trying to fit a 21 - inch cap over a 20 - inch pipe a mile away .
That 's just horrendously hard to do .
It 's not like you and I standing on the ground pushing -- they 're using little robots to do this . ''
Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , eventually collapsing into the Gulf of Mexico , an estimated 20 million to 40 million gallons of oil has spewed , eclipsing the 11 million that leaked from the Exxon Valdez disaster .
BP PLC 's Doug Suttles said that although there 's no guarantee the company 's latest cut - and - cap effort to close off the leak will work , he remained hopeful , but would n't guarantee success .
Engineers have put underwater robots and equipment in place <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">this week</TIMEX3> after a bold attempt to plug the well by force - feeding it heavy mud and cement -- called a ` ` top kill '' -- was aborted over <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-W21-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Crews pumped thousands of gallons of the mud into the well but were unable to overcome the pressure of the oil .
The company said if the small dome is successful it could capture and siphon a majority of the gushing oil to the surface .

But the cut and cap will not halt the oil flow , just capture some of it and funnel it to vessels waiting at the surface .
The British oil giant has tried and failed repeatedly to halt the flow of the oil , and this attempt like others has never been tried before a mile beneath the ocean .
Experts warned it could be even riskier than the others because slicing open the 20 - inch riser could unleash more oil if there was a kink in the pipe that restricted some of the flow .
Eric Smith , an associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute , likened the procedure to trying to place a tiny cap on a fire hydrant that 's blowing straight up .
` ` Will they have enough weight to overcome the force of the flow ? ''
` ` It could create a lot of turbulence , but I do think they 'll have enough weight . ''
But BP 's best chance to actually plug the leak rests with a pair of relief wells but those wo n't likely be completed until <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The company has carefully prepared the next phase , knowing that another failure could mean millions more gallons spew into the ocean and lead to even more public pressure .
And they say they have learned valuable lessons from the failure of a bigger version of the containment cap <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-05">last month</TIMEX3> that was clogged with icelike slush .
