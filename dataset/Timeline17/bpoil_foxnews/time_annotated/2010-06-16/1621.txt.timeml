A summary of events on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">June 16</TIMEX3> , Day 57 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that began with the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion and fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP PLC , which is in charge of cleanup and containment .
The blast killed 11 workers .
Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown - out undersea well .
President Barack Obama wrested a $ 20 billion compensation guarantee and an apology to the nation from BP , announcing the company would set up a major claims fund for shrimpers , restaurateurs and others whose lives and livelihoods are being wrecked by the oil flooding into the Gulf of Mexico .
Applause broke out during a community meeting in Orange Beach , Ala. , on the news .
` ` We asked for that <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> and they laughed at us , '' Mayor Tony Kennon said .
` ` Thank you , President Obama , for taking a bunch of rednecks ' suggestion and making it happen . ''
BP said it will suspend its dividend for the rest of <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> and set up the $ 20 billion fund to assure victims of the Gulf oil spill that they will be compensated for their losses .
The British oil giant also will cut spending and sell some assets to deal with the cleanup and compensation costs , which have already hit $ 1.75 billion .
BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg announced the moves <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after emerging from the White House , where he and other BP executives met for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> with Obama .
The ` ` small people '' of the Gulf Coast have a humongous message for oil giant BP : They 're tired of the company 's big - time executives making insensitive comments .
Svanberg told reporters in Washington : ` ` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care , but that is not the case with BP .
We care about the small people . ''
Justin Taffinder of New Orleans was not amused .
` ` We 're not small people .
We 're human beings .
They 're no greater than us .
We do n't bow down to them .
We do n't pray to them , '' Taffinder said .
BP CEO Tony Hayward expects to tell Congress he is ` ` personally devastated '' by the Gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger Americans feel toward him and his company .
The explosion and sinking of the rig ` ` never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , '' he said in testimony to be delivered to a House panel <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . ''
A copy of Hayward 's testimony was obtained <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> by The Associated Press .
BP began burning oil siphoned from the ruptured well as part of its plans to more than triple the amount of crude it can stop from reaching the sea , the company said .
BP PLC said oil and gas siphoned from the well first reached a semi - submersible drilling rig on the ocean surface <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-16T01:00" mod="APPROX">around 1 a.m.</TIMEX3> .
Once that gas reaches the rig , it will be mixed with compressed air , shot down a specialized boom made by Schlumberger Ltd. and ignited at sea .
It 's the first time this particular burner has been deployed in the Gulf of Mexico .
Journalists covering the oil spill have been yelled at , kicked off public beaches and islands and threatened with arrest in the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3W" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly three weeks</TIMEX3> since the government promised improved media access .
Adm. Thad Allen issued a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-31">May 31</TIMEX3> directive to BP and federal officials ensuring media access to sites along the coast .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles followed up with a letter to news organizations , saying the company supports people 's rights to share their thoughts with reporters .

But those efforts have done little to curtail the obstacles , harassment and intimidation tactics journalists are facing while covering the spill .
Marine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange -- and troubling -- phenomena .
Fish and other wildlife are fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast .
But that is not the hopeful sign it might appear to be , researchers say .
The animals ' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted , and the crowding could result in mass die - offs as fish run out of oxygen .
Also , the animals could easily get devoured by predators .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P50Y">50 years</TIMEX3> of watching wetlands created by the fertile Mississippi River turn into open water , Louisiana residents finally got what they 'd long awaited : A U.S. president saying he 'll fight to save what little is left along their eroding coast .
Though details were vague , President Barack Obama 's pledge to restore the Gulf Coast 's degraded coast line has multibillion - dollar implications for the region 's culture and economy and could preserve wildlife endangered by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
In an Oval Office address <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2010-06-15TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> , Obama said he was committed to making sure southern Louisiana , which is hemorrhaging a football field of marshland every <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PT38M">38 minutes</TIMEX3> , and other coastlines are saved .
