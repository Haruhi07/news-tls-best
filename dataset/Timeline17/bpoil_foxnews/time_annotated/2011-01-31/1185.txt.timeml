OCEAN SPRINGS , Miss. -- BP 's compensation fund for Gulf oil spill victims has issued a final settlement payment to just one of the thousands of people and businesses waiting for checks , records show , and that $ 10 million payout went to a company after the oil giant intervened on its behalf .
BP wo n't identify the business , citing confidentiality , but acknowledges it lobbied for the settlement .
The amount far exceeds smaller stop - gap payments that some individuals and businesses have received while they wait for their own final settlements .
The Gulf Coast Claims Facility was set up in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> to independently administer BP 's $ 20 billion compensation fund in the aftermath of its <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> oil well blowout off Louisiana .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2011-W05-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> , roughly 91,000 people and businesses had filed for final settlements , but the fund 's administrator , Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , has said those checks wo n't start rolling out until <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February</TIMEX3> at the earliest .
Thousands of people have received some money to tide them over until a final settlement amount is offered , but only that one listed as paid on the facility 's web site has so far received a check .
A BP spokesman called it ` ` a unique situation in which an existing BP business partner and BP submitted a view on a specific claim '' to the facility .
The facility ` ` reviewed our positions and made an independent decision regarding the outcome of the claim , '' BP spokeswoman Hejdi Feick said in an e - mail <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-01-30TNI">Sunday night</TIMEX3> to The Associated Press .
Feick did not immediately return a telephone message on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> seeking additional details .
Feinberg said <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> the facility never reviewed that claim for merit .
He said BP struck an outside deal with the business and told the fund to make the payment .
` ` At the request of the parties , the settlement reached between BP and the other party was paid out of the GCCF fund , '' Feinberg told the AP .
` ` It was a private settlement and we paid it , but we were not privy to the settlement negotiations between BP and that party .
` ` We never reviewed the claim , '' Feinberg added .
` ` We honored the request of the parties to fund the claim . ''
Rudy Toler , 30 , a shrimper and oysterman from Gulfport , Miss. , called the payment disgusting .
` ` It makes me sick , '' said Toler , a married father of four who has n't received a dime from the fund .
` ` It 's just criminal . ''
Early on , he filed a claim for losses of about $ 140,000 for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the six months</TIMEX3> he could n't work through <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> .
The claims facility tells him his paperwork is under review again , but in the meantime , Toler is struggling to pay his bills and feed his family .
` ` I ' m doing the best I can , '' he said <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">Every day</TIMEX3> is a struggle . ''
Mayor Tony Kennon of Orange Beach , Ala. , a tourist town hit particularly hard by the oil spill , said the early settlement payment ` ` reeks of favoritism . ''
` ` It stinks , '' Kennon said <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2011-01-31">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` It 's exactly what we ' ve been screaming about .
There 's not an independent entity .
There 's no oversight . ''
Feinberg has faced repeated criticism from lawmakers , plaintiffs attorneys and claimants who complain about a lack of transparency and independence from BP , as well as claims being shortchanged and paid too slowly , or not at all .
His law firm had been receiving $ 850,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> from BP for its work .
Feinberg is <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> negotiating with BP over a new payment structure to run the fund through <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2013-08">August 2013</TIMEX3> .
Any money left over from the $ 20 billion is expected to be returned to BP .
Feinberg has repeatedly promised fairness and transparency .
He calls the program a success and notes it has already paid out more than $ 3.3 billion to some 251,000 claimants .
However , roughly half of the 484,000 claims filed have been denied because of ineligibility or lack of documentation , meaning they got nothing , like Toler .
And while there is an appeals process through the U.S. Coast Guard for disgruntled claimants , the agency has consistently sided with the facility .
Feinberg told AP that the Coast Guard had processed 264 out of 507 appeals filed and in every case has agreed with the decisions by the claims fund .
The program first allowed claimants to file for emergency six - month payments to keep them afloat , but many of those claims were denied .
Those that were n't often were paid fractions of what they claimed they lost .
The process <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> allows for three options .
Spill victims can file for a quick cash one - time payment of $ 5,000 for individuals and $ 25,000 for businesses .
More than 80,000 claimants have filed and been paid in that category , giving up their right to anymore money or to sue BP or any other responsible company .
Claimants may also opt for a final settlement , but also would have to give up the right to sue .
Residents and business owners who are n't ready to make that decision could instead file for interim quarterly payments through <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2013-08">August 2013</TIMEX3> , provided they can show proof of continued losses .
