Presidents are never really off the clock , even when they go on vacation .

But President Obama 's decision to skip the traditional <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-31">Memorial Day</TIMEX3> ceremony in Arlington while on his second vacation since the BP oil spill began has some wondering what the schedule says about his priorities .
On ` ` vacation , '' Obama still holds staff meetings , occasionally attends local events and often gets his ` ` relaxation '' time swallowed up by pressing national and international business -- his vacation to Hawaii in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-12">December</TIMEX3> coincided with the attempted <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-12-25">Christmas Day</TIMEX3> airline bombing .
The retreat <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W21-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> is marked by a side - trip to Louisiana to inspect the damages from the oil spill .
But some conservatives , still smarting over the criticism George W. Bush fielded for his frequent trips to Crawford , Texas , say Obama 's trip to Chicago over <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-31">Memorial Day</TIMEX3> weekend is conspicuously poor in its timing .
Obama , who was headed to Chicago <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-05-27TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> , will not be at Arlington National Cemetery for the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-31">Memorial Day</TIMEX3> ceremony -- which he attended <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> .
Instead , the president plans to be at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood , Ill. , while Vice President Biden takes his place in Arlington for the wreath - laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .
Pete Hegseth , director of the conservative Vets for Freedom , said he does n't want to ` ` extrapolate too much , '' but questioned why a war - time president would not pencil in that ceremony .
` ` It does n't mean he does n't care , but I think it is a reflection of priorities , '' he said .
` ` We 're still at war ...
and he 's not called out to the carpet on that . ''
Dana Perino , former Bush White House press secretary , called the decision a ` ` curious choice . ''
` ` I do think that symbolically that probably was not a very good choice , '' she told Fox News .
The Arlington visit is a fairly <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> tradition .
Former President Ronald Reagan attended four of them in his <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> in office , while former President George H.W. Bush sent Vice President Dan Quayle to every one .
Former President Bill Clinton , though , attended <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> and George W. Bush missed only one , in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2002">2002</TIMEX3> , when he was in Normandy , France , visiting the American cemetery .
Philip Molfese , a Chicago - based Democratic political consultant , said Obama will still be able to ` ` pay tribute '' at the Lincoln National Cemetery .
And he dismissed the idea that Obama would somehow be stepping away from the oil spill crisis in the Gulf while in Chicago .
The president plans to visit the Gulf coast <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-21">Friday</TIMEX3> before returning to the Windy City .
` ` He 's never really out of touch with what 's happening , '' said Molfese , president of the political firm Grainger Terry , Inc.
` ` These guys are never off the clock .
...
They 're constantly surrounded by people , they 're constantly getting updates .
Whether they 're operating in Chicago or they 're operating in the White House , they 're still going to be getting constant communication . ''
The White House has tried to fend off suggestions that it has not acted forcefully enough to mitigate the damage from the oil spill -- Obama held a full - scale press conference <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="TIME" value="2010-05-27TAF">Thursday afternoon</TIMEX3> where he spoke extensively about mitigation efforts .
The Obamas have not made an extensive visit to Chicago in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3> and in a sense are trying to make good on prior pledges to visit their home town more often .
But critics point out that the trip is their second since the Gulf oil rig exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> -- the first family traveled to Asheville , N.C. , <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-W20-WE">that weekend</TIMEX3> .
