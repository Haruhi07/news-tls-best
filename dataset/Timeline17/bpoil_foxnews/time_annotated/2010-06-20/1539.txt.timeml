Massachusetts Rep. Ed Markey on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> released an internal BP document that shows the oil spill could spew 100,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> into the Gulf of Mexico , far more than has been estimated in public accounts .
The worst - case scenario is based on what would happen if the damaged wellhead were removed and not capped .
The document showed a low - ball estimate of 55,000 barrels per day .
Markey , who 's been a vocal critic of the oil giant , said BP has been unscrupulous since the start of the crisis .
` ` Right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent .
First they said it was only 1,000 .
Then they said it was 5,000 barrels .
<TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> we 're up to 100,000 barrels , '' Markey said on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . ''
` ` It was their technology .
It was their spill cam .
They are the ones that should have known right from the beginning and , either to limit their liability or because they were grossly incompetent , they delayed a full response to the magnitude of this disaster , '' he said .
BP spokesman Toby Odone on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> told Reuters that he did not believe the company had underestimated the size of the spill .
` ` We ' ve always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled , and that 's exactly what we 're doing .
We ' ve mounted the biggest spill response in history . ''
Markey , the Democratic chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment , said that BP knew long before the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig that it had problems with cementing , leaks in the blowout preventer and gas kicks .
Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander leading the government 's response to the spill , said <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> that the condition of the wellbore , or the hole drilled to reach the oil field , is still unknown and is the reason that other failed efforts to cap the well were n't more rigorous .
` ` This document raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it .
It is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill , ''
Markey said in a statement released with the document .
` ` BP needs to tell us what it will do if the wellbore is compromised and 100,000 barrels per day of oil spills into the ocean .
At this point , we need real contingency planning , '' Markey added .
