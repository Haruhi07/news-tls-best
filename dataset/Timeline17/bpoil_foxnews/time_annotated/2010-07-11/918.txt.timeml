WASHINGTON --
It 's all so familiar .
A technological disaster , then a presidential commission examining what went wrong .
And ultimately a discovery that while technology marches on , concern for safety lags .
Technology is n't as foolproof as it seemed .
An offshore oil rig explodes , creating the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
The common thread -- which the new presidential oil spill commission will be looking for -- often is technological arrogance and hubris .
It 's the belief by those in charge that they 're the experts , that they know what they 're doing is safe .
Add to that the human weaknesses of avoidance , greed and sloppiness , say academics who study disasters .
Even before the oil spill commission holds its first meeting <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> in New Orleans , panel co - chairman William Reilly could n't help but point out something he 's already noticed .
The technology to clean up after an oil spill ` ` is primitive , ''
Reilly said .
` ` It 's wholly disproportionate to the tremendous technological advances that have allowed deepwater drilling to go forward .
It just has n't kept pace . ''
Then he added that government regulation also has n't kept pace .
And something else has n't kept up either , Reilly said : how the oil industry assesses and works with the risk of catastrophic damage from spills .
Cutting - edge technology often works flawlessly .
At first , everyone worries about risk .
Then people get lulled into complacency by success and they forget that they are operating on the edge , say experts who study disasters .
Corners get cut , problems ignored .
Technological disasters , like the BP oil spill , follow a well - worn ` ` trail of tears , '' said Bob Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor who has studied 630 disasters of all types .
Bea is also an expert on offshore drilling and is consulting with the presidential commission .
Bea categorizes disasters into four groups .
One such group is when an organization simply ignores warning signs through overconfidence and incompetence .
He thinks the BP spill falls into that category .
Bea pointed to congressional testimony that BP ignored problems with a dead battery , leaky cement job and loose hydraulic fittings .
It 's that type of root cause -- not the equipment failure alone -- that the oil spill commission will focus on , including looking at the corporate and regulatory ` ` culture '' that led to bad decisions , Reilly said .
Disasters do n't happen because of ` ` an evil empire , ''
Bea said .
` ` It 's hubris , arrogance and indolence . ''
And disasters will keep on happening .
In the future , watch out for problems with the U.S. power grid , Sacramento levee failures , flood protection problems along coastal cities and even some of the newest high - tech airplanes , said Rutgers University professor Lee Clarke , author of the book ` ` Worst Cases . ''
` ` There 's nothing safe out there , '' said Yale University professor Charles Perrow , author of the book ` ` Normal Accidents . '' ''
We like to pretend there is and argue afterward , ` That 's why we took the risks because it had n't failed before . ' ''
Technological improvements have gradually led to more daring offshore drilling attempts .
` ` It kind of creeps up on you , '' Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in an interview with The Associated Press .
Then suddenly you realize that <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> only robots can do what people used to do because the drilling is so deep , he said .
Clarke put it this way : ` ` We ' ve been doing this <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> , week in , week out , so <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">next week</TIMEX3> when we go to 5,000 feet , it will be like <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">last week</TIMEX3> when we went to 300 feet , '' Clarke said .
` ` It 's just the arrogant presumption that you have got the thing under control , whatever the thing is .
In this case , it 's drilling beyond your depth . ''
Paul Fischbeck , a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University , said the existence of a blowout preventer -- a final backup system which in this case did n't work -- often encourages people to take extra risks .
But the oil industry was so confident in its safety that it used to brag when compared to another high - tech gold standard : NASA .
` ` They looked more successful than NASA , '' said Rice University oil industry scholar Amy Myers Jaffe .
` ` They had less mechanical failures . ''
The oil rig explosion ` ` reminds me an awful lot of the NASA accidents , '' said Stanford physics professor Douglas Osheroff , who was on the commission that examined the causes of the space shuttle Columbia disaster in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
` ` Obviously none of these systems are fail - safe , '' Osheroff said .
` ` People do n't spend enough time thinking about what could go wrong . ''
And because people are so sure of themselves , when they see something go wrong that they ca n't fix , they accept it , Osheroff said .
The Columbia accident investigation board called it ` ` normalization of deviance . ''
Pieces of foam insulation had broken off the shuttle external fuel tank six previous times before that problem proved fatal with Columbia when a piece of foam knocked a deadly hole in a shuttle wing .
Hot gas had singed ` ` O '' rings in space shuttle boosters well before the problem led Challenger to explode at launch in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> .
Yale 's Perrow pointed to NASA 's shuttles and another BP disaster -- the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 people -- as cases of simply ignoring ` ` heavy warnings '' from experts .
When the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board looked into the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> refinery fire it noted that BP had the same problems with ` ` safety culture '' that NASA had before Columbia .
` ` The Texas City disaster was caused by organizational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP Corporation , '' the board 's final report said .
` ` Warning signs of a possible disaster were present for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXY">several years</TIMEX3> , but company officials did not intervene effectively to prevent it . ''
There have been times when warnings of disaster are heeded .
The Y2 K computer bug is noteworthy for prevention , Clarke said .
Many people scoffed and criticized the government for making such a big deal of something that turned out to be a fizzle .

But that 's because of all the effort to prevent the disaster , Clarke said .
Unfortunately , safety costs money , so it 's usually not a priority , Clarke said .
Most of the time ` ` you ca n't get anybody to listen , '' he said .
` ` We 're very reactive about disasters in the United States . ''
People do n't think about them until afterward , he said , and then they say : ` ` You should have seen that coming . ''
