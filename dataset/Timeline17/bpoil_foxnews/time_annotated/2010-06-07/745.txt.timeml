WASHINGTON --
WASHINGTON -LRB-
AP -RRB- --
Nobody led .
Not the president of the United States .
Not the chief executive of BP .
Not Congress , federal agencies or local elected officials .
From its fiery beginning , the Gulf oil spill has stood as a concentrated reminder of why , <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P4DE" mod="MORE_THAN">over four decades</TIMEX3> , Americans have lost faith in nearly every national institution .
Like Hurricane Katrina , a natural disaster that caused voters to question then - President George W. Bush 's credibility , the poisonous geyser at the Gulf 's floor threatens to undermine Barack Obama 's presidency .
More alarmingly , the spill exacerbates the worry that this nation founded on the principle of trust <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> faces a crisis of faith in its public and private institutions -- government and big business particularly .
` ` This spill , it 's another blow to the body politic , '' says John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Mass. .
It is , he says , another excuse to be cynical and uninvolved -- ` ` exactly the opposite of what has always been the American zeitgeist , a sense that we , collectively and through our institutions , can be something greater than ourselves . ''
It 's hard to summon that rising - sun aspiration when the unemployment rate hovers near double digits .
When wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue unabated .
When terrorists take aim from inside and outside U.S. borders .
When the U.S. Treasury writes massive IOUs to China and public schools write off millions of poorly educated children .
Then along comes the oil spill to remind people of why they do n't trust leaders -- and why so many Americans , looking for information and action , are turning instead to blogs , Twitter feeds and their friends .
Consider this revealing scene : With reddish - brown oil globs washing ashore at Fort Morgan , Ala. , Faith Kaiser and Bertice McPherson decided to do what generations of Americans have done when government ca n't -- or wo n't -- tackle a big problem : They handled it themselves .
Before paid cleanup crews started work , the volunteers pulled on rubber gloves and picked up the gooey mess .
As they did so , Kaiser said this : ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P6M">Six months</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the government will lie to us and say everything is fine . ''
At the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1787">1787</TIMEX3> Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin famously observed that he had been trying to determine throughout the debate whether a sun painted on George Washington 's chair was rising or setting .
` ` But <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> at length , '' he said , ` ` I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun . ''
And with that , the Founders created a nation upon the fundamental principle of trust .
They had an untested belief in the ability of people to lead themselves -- to choose leaders from their own ranks and to hold those leaders accountable .
Even our currency , once backed by the promise of precious metal , is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">today</TIMEX3> built upon a faith - based system called ` ` fiat '' -- a Latin term meaning ` ` let it be done . ''
In a dictatorship , people can lose faith in institutions and the apparatus of state can step in .

But democracy ca n't survive without faith in its institutions because the people , by definition , create and control them .
While there were surely crises of faith during the Civil War , the Progressive Era and others times of tumult , the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="19" mod="START">early 20th century</TIMEX3> was marked by a reflexive sense of trust in the nation 's institutions .
Even as Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal vastly expanded the government safety net , a new breed of private charities and social reformers did n't bother waiting on government to help the poor , infirm and abused .
But things started to change in the mid-<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="19">20th century</TIMEX3> , when polls showed a steady decline on the question of whether Americans trusted government in Washington to do what is right .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1958">1958</TIMEX3> , when more than 70 percent said they trusted government most or all of the time , the trend line steadily drops until it hits <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="192" mod="MID">the mid-20s</TIMEX3> in the post - Watergate era .
The trust line creeps up for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="PXY">a few years</TIMEX3> -- without getting nowhere near the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1958">1958</TIMEX3> mark -- and plunges again in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1994">1994</TIMEX3> , the year President Bill Clinton 's political faltering caused Democrats to lose control of Congress after <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P40Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 40 years</TIMEX3> in power .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-04">two months ago</TIMEX3> , a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 22 percent of the public say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time , among the lowest measures in a half <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1CE">a century</TIMEX3> .
` ` This spill has just got to make matters worse , '' said Pew pollster Andy Kohut .
` ` People are asking , Who 's in charge ?
Why ca n't they plug it ?
What going on here ? ''
Just 25 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of Congress .
Favorability ratings also have fallen significantly for seven of 13 federal agencies included in the Pew survey , including the Environmental Protection Agency .
Faith in institutions across the board has fallen since <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="197">the 1970s</TIMEX3> , at least among the sample of institutions tracked by Gallup : churches , the U.S. Supreme Court , banks , public schools , newspapers , Congress and organized labor .
One of the least - trusted institutions is big business , no surprise after corporate wrongdoing and lax government oversight combined to help create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
Sixteen percent of Americans said they had a ` ` great deal '' or ` ` quite a lot '' of confidence in big corporations in <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , compared to 32 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P30Y">30 years</TIMEX3> prior .
The only exception to this trend is the military , which has increased from a 54 percent favorability rating in the post - Vietnam era to 82 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
Part of the problem : Americans <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">today</TIMEX3> might expect too much of government and other institutions .
Take the oil spill , for example .
Accidents happen and , right or wrong , the government is not in the drilling or drill - capping business .
` ` I take responsibility .
It is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' Barack Obama declared <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few days ago</TIMEX3> .
In the same news conference , Obama also acknowledged his administration could have done better in dealing with the biggest oil spill in the nation 's history and misjudged the industry 's ability to cope with a worst - case scenario .
It was a new twist for the U.S. presidency , an office normally filled by men who accept responsibility or admit fault only grudgingly .
Obama may be recognizing that accountability breeds trust .
<TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN">Less than two years</TIMEX3> removed from an election victory built on his promise to fix Washington 's broken institutions , Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> seems a captive of them .
His administration 's regulators cozied up to the oil industry before the spill and moved slowly afterward to seize control .
The president himself often seemed detached .
Who else dropped the ball ?
-- BP and its chief executive , Tony Hayward .
As his company 's oil filled up the Gulf , he had the audacity to complain that ` ` I 'd like my life back . ''
--
The Minerals Management Service , the regulatory agency that failed to clean up its act despite Obama 's promise during the campaign to end the ` ` cozy relationship '' between the oil industry and federal regulators .
-- Even the Coast Guard -- the one agency that survived Katrina with its image enhanced -- is <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being criticized for its lack of transparency and command .
And the public stews .
Listen to Billy Nugesser , president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish : ` ` We are dying a slow death here . ''
The public 's unconditional faith in national institutions is dying , too .
We ca n't buy a ` ` Shrek '' drinking glass at McDonald 's because it might be laced with cadmium .
We ca n't talk about the Catholic church without wondering whether something untoward might be afoot .
We ca n't watch a home run without wondering if our pro - ballplayer heroes are juiced .
Which may be why an umpire 's blown call denying a rookie pitcher a historic ` ` perfect game '' became a viral story <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">this week</TIMEX3> .
Americans saw in the umpire 's apology and the pitcher 's gracious acceptance a sign that one of their institutions -- the made - by - America game of baseball -- still includes leaders who do the right thing even when the situation is less than perfect .
From their government , Americans do n't expect perfection .
But the system requires that people at least have faith in their political leaders to be competent and accountable .
` ` If people do n't believe , if people do n't give , if people do n't trust , they will pick the politicians who are the loudest rather than the most sincere , '' said Baick , the history professor .
` ` They will pick the rabble rouser rather than the technocrat who gets things done . ''
