<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-18">June 18</TIMEX3> : This image from video provided by BP PLC shows oil continuing to gush millions of gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , from the broken wellhead , at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico .
AP Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , which owns a quarter of BP PLC 's blown - out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-18" mod="END">late Friday</TIMEX3> blasted BP ` ` reckless decisions and actions '' that led to the well 's explosion .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> , oil giant BP PLC used a well design that has been called ` ` risky '' by Congressional investigators in more than one out of three of its deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico , significantly more often than most peers , a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data shows .
` ` The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP 's reckless decisions and actions , '' said Hackett in the statement .
` ` We recognize that ultimately we have obligations under federal law related to the oil spill , but will look to BP to continue to pay all legitimate claims as they have repeatedly stated that they will do . ''
The design was used on the well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers and causing America 's worst offshore oil spill .
The only other major well design , which is more expensive , includes more safeguards against a natural - gas blowout of the kind that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon .
A Wall Street Journal analysis of records provided by the U.S. Minerals Management Service shows that BP used the less costly design -- called ` ` long string '' -- on 35 percent of its deepwater wells since <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2003-07">July 2003</TIMEX3> , the earliest date the well - design data were available .
Anadarko used it on 42 percent of its deepwater Gulf wells , though it says it does n't do so in wells of the type drilled by BP .
BP chief executive officer Tony Hayward said in a statement that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations ` ` These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , '' Hayward said .
` ` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . ''
Both companies used the design much more often , on average , than other major Gulf drillers .
Out of 218 deepwater wells in the Gulf drilled since <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2003-07">July 2003</TIMEX3> , 26 percent used the long - string design .
It derives its name from its use of a single , long ` ` string '' of pipe from the sea floor to the bottom of the well .
Other big drillers use long - string design less frequently than BP , according to the Journal 's data analysis .
Royal Dutch Shell PLC used long string designs on 8 percent of its wells and Chevron Corp. on 15 percent .
Australian firm BHP Billiton PLC used long string on 4 percent of its wells .
