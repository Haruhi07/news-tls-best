ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- BP 's $ 20 billion fund to compensate victims of the Gulf oil spill has been inundated with inflated or unsupported claims and in some cases , outright fraud -- all slowing down the process of getting money to people who need and deserve it , the administrator of the program says .
Kenneth Feinberg said more than a third of the roughly 104,000 applicants need to do more to back up their claims , and thousands of claims have no documentation at all .
He added that the amount sought in some cases bears no resemblance to actual losses , such as a fisherman 's claim for $ 10 million ` ` on what was obviously a legitimate claim of a few thousand dollars . ''
` ` People can put down on a claims form all sorts of numbers , '' he said .
At the same time , hundreds of claims that were initially denied have been accepted as Feinberg adjusts rules for compensation , such as whether people need to be physically close to the spill to get paid .
` ` At the beginning , it 's always rough , '' said Feinberg , an attorney who previously oversaw claims for 9\/11 victims .
` ` Hopefully , by the end of this program , people will feel that the fund treated them fairly . ''
Many claimants are still waiting for checks from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which is doling out BP 's money to oil spill victims .
The Associated Press interviewed dozens who say they have received small fractions of the compensation they requested .
Claims have been bogged down by the sheer volume of requests for money as livelihoods have crumbled since the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> rig explosion that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil over <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">about three months</TIMEX3> .
` ` We do n't have any business left , '' said Sheryl Lindsay , a beach wedding planner who filed a claim for about $ 240,000 for lost revenue from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> through <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-12">December</TIMEX3> because of cancellations .
The check she received from the BP claims center was for just $ 7,700 .
Lindsay said she <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> learned that her claim will be reviewed for possible additional payments , but she needs money <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
She closed her coastal Alabama office and said she will soon file for bankruptcy .
Such complaints have ` ` not fallen on deaf ears , '' Feinberg said .
In an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W39">last week</TIMEX3> , he promised that kinks would be worked out and more generous payments would come , but that it is taking time to sort the legitimate claims from the overstated and the fraudulent .
` ` We have scores of applications for financial aid that appear to be fraudulent , '' and are being reviewed for possible forwarding to the Justice Department for criminal investigation , Feinberg said .
Some of the suspect claims have obvious discrepancies , while others appear to be multiple filings for the same loss , he said .
` ` Our resources are diverted , and we become skeptical and concerned , '' he added .
` ` Fraud always slows the process down . ''
To date , the fund has paid out nearly $ 1 billion to about 50,000 claimants .
Claims officials would not provide AP with the total amount actually requested by those claimants .
A Feinberg spokeswoman said the number is ` ` irrelevant , '' given the volume of claims filed with problems .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W39">the past week</TIMEX3> , the number of denied claims actually fell , from 528 to 118 , as checks were cut and mailed to businesses that were initially told they would get no help .
Sales manager Jeff Silvers had been shocked to learn that his building supplies shop just a half mile from the Alabama coast was not considered to be affected by the oil that sullied beaches and marshes , sent tourists packing and kept fishing boats idle at harbors .
Swift Supply , he said , lost a huge chunk of revenue because customers canceled plans to build docks , do home improvements and complete construction on new houses with the uncertainty that followed the explosion and oil gusher .
But after he applied for compensation , he initially was told ` ` we were n't in the geographic area of the spill . ''
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-W39">last week</TIMEX3> , however , Silvers got a check for everything he asked for .
He would not say how much he received .
Feinberg has decided that proximity to affected areas will no longer play a role in compensation approval .
` ` I ' m very happy , '' Silvers said , ` ` but there 's still a lot of businesses that have n't been paid . ''
Even the Justice Department has raised concern about the slow pace of payments .
` ` The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill has disrupted the lives of thousands upon thousands of individuals , often cutting off the income on which they depend , '' the department said in a <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-09-17">Sept. 17</TIMEX3> letter to Feinberg .
` ` Many of these individuals and businesses simply do not have the resources to get by while they await processing . ''
Feinberg , however , said many of the claims are simply too flawed to pay out .
` ` We have thousands of claims where there is no documentation , none , '' he said .
Of the more than 104,000 claims filed as of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-10-04">Monday</TIMEX3> , more than 39,000 require additional documentation and remain on hold .
Thousands of others remain under review .
President Barack Obama tapped Feinberg to oversee the BP claims fund , which the oil giant created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill .
Feinberg declined to say how much he is being paid by BP , only that it is a flat fee ` ` totally unrelated '' to the size of the fund and amounts paid .
A final settlement will be offered in the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> , but to accept the money , applicants will have to give up the right to sue BP .
The money being doled out <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is considered only emergency help , but will be factored into the final payment offer .
Fishing guide Mike Garey , who got just $ 21,000 in response to his request for $ 70,000 in losses , is n't sure what he 'll do .
` ` The phones are n't ringing .
The e - mails are n't coming in , '' he said .
` ` Where will we be in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> ?
Nobody knows the answer to that so how can we accept a final payment ? ''
