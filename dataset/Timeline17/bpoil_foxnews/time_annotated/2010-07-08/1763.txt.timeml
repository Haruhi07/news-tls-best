<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-06">July 6</TIMEX3> : Barges lined up to block oil are seen from the air in Chef Menteur Pass , which connects the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Borgne to Lake Pontchartrain , in New Orleans , La. .
AP NEW ORLEANS --
The exasperation with BP felt by residents of the Gulf states is spreading to shareholders -- and some are taking the oil giant to court .
Since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig disaster on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2011-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , BP shares have lost about $ 85 billion in value .
The toll for institutional investors who hold 79 percent of the company -- including public and private pension plans -- is around $ 67 billion .
BP 's suspension of its quarterly dividend has only exacerbated the damage .
At least five individual investor suits have been filed , BP employees are suing over the slide in value of company stock in their 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans and the New York state comptroller intends to sue over losses to his state 's public employee pension fund .
Unlike the across - the - board Wall Street meltdown of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> that swept away hundreds of billions of dollars , the damage to U.S. pension plans caused by one plunging stock is minimized by the diversification of their investments .
The BP individual retirement savings plan has a sizable investment in BP shares , but it 's reasonable compared with the Enron plans that got wiped out in that company 's collapse .
Even so , the plans are n't happy about the red number BP has dropped on their financial statements .
<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06">Last month</TIMEX3> , New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli pledged to sue BP , alleging the company misled investors about its safety procedures and its ability to respond to an oil spill and therefore inflated the stock 's price in violation of securities laws .
DiNapoli 's office plans to file a motion to join four individual shareholder suits filed in Louisiana and California to form a class action , under which all shareholders , including other pension plans , could join .
The $ 133 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund , which DiNapoli serves as trustee , held 19 million BP shares at the time of the disaster .
The fund has since trimmed its holdings to 14.6 million shares .
During that time , BP suspended its dividend , which is attractive to pension plans because of the investment income it provides .
The fund has n't released an exact loss from the sale , citing the pending court action .
BP has refused to comment .
Feeding the frustration , for both shareholders and Gulf Coast residents , has been BP 's inability to cap its undersea well 40 miles off of Louisiana .
Oil has <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been gushing for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P79D">79 days</TIMEX3> .
BP is drilling two relief wells that are expected to shut off the leak by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
Analyst Pavel Molchanon , who follows BP for Raymond James Financial Inc. , said if that happens , BP would likely reinstate a dividend in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> , but Molchanon says U.S. investors should expect less than the 80 cents per share they were getting <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="P1Q" quant="EACH">each quarter</TIMEX3> before the spill .
As for BP workers , a suit filed in Illinois federal court seeks class action status on behalf of all employees with company retirement accounts .
Its complaints echo those raised by DiNapoli .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-01-01">Jan. 1</TIMEX3> , BP stock made up nearly 30 percent of BP employee accounts , or about $ 2.45 billion worth of retirement savings , said Mike Alfred , CEO of BrightScope , a San Diego - based firm that rates about 50,000 401 -LRB- k
-RRB- plans .
The legal argument likely will center on whether BP workers were allowed to take excessive risk by having too much money in company stock , Alfred said .
In perhaps the most high - profile case of this type , Enron Corp. employees received stock that became worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- only to see it become worthless as the company fell apart in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> amid scandal .
` ` The amount of the BP stock in those plans is not exceptional , '' Alfred said .
` ` There are many more plans that have more company stock . ''
Steven Davidoff , a professor at the Ohio State University law school , says history shows that once a class action is granted and large numbers of plaintiffs join in , companies try to settle to avoid the possibility of unmanageable damage awards .
Davidoff said the potential settlement value for BP shareholders likely will be less than in cases where a company has ` ` a record of malfeasance at high management . ''
` ` This is not so much a fraud case as a nondisclosure case , '' Davidoff said .
The plans that have n't sued are still big enough to get management 's attention .
` ` We do intend to engage BP in a corporate governance discussion at the appropriate time because the shareowner losses are severe given the catastrophic failures related to the oil spill , '' says Patricia Macht , a spokesperson for the California Public Employees Retirement System .
Calpers , with $ 205 billion in assets , said it has n't altered its basic five - year ` ` buy - and - hold '' strategy -- although the value of its BP holdings fell from about $ 585.7 million on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> to $ 289.2 million on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-06-30">June 30</TIMEX3> .
It 's still just a paper loss -- and Calpers retains its shareholder voting power .
That power could be used at annual shareholder meetings to vote against upper management and board directors .
But BP 's next annual meeting does n't occur until <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> .
Many observers say a shake - up is possible before then , likely involving CEO Tony Hayward .
BP did not return a request for comment on any potential conversation with Calpers .
Other pension funds , including the $ 96.7 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas , the $ 47 billion Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System and the $ 8 billion Louisiana State Employees Retirement System say their BP holdings represent only a tiny fraction of their total investments .
None would say what their next action might be .
Alabama 's four state pension dumped their BP stock .
The executive director of the Retirement Systems of Alabama , David Bonner , said 6.25 million shares were sold in <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> .
The funds lost just over $ 4 million overall on the transactions .
But since the funds accumulated $ 25.9 million in dividends <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P15Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over 15 years</TIMEX3> , ` ` We 're $ 21 million ahead , '' Bonner said .
BP 's traditional employee pension fund has n't lost a dime on BP shares :
The fund 's rules forbid it to either buy company stock or make company loans .
According to the fund 's <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> audit , <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2009">the latest year</TIMEX3> for which figures are available , its top holding was in rival Royal Dutch Shell with 3.1 percent of its assets invested .
