<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">May 2</TIMEX3> : A sign on the side of a road in Boothville , La. calls for help to combat the massive Gulf oil spill .
AP FILE : President Obama talks with U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">May 2</TIMEX3> as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. .
` ` Let me be clear : BP is responsible for this leak ; BP will be paying the bill , '' Obama said while touring the area <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> .

While it 's true that the federal Oil Pollution Act , enacted in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> in response to the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , makes BP responsible for cleanup costs , the law caps the company 's liability for economic damages -- such as lost wages , shortened fishing seasons or lagging tourism -- at $ 75 million , a pittance compared to potential losses .
Administration officials insist BP will be held responsible anyway , noting that if the company is found negligent or criminally liable , the cap disappears .
Claims also can potentially be made under other state or federal laws , officials said .
Yet the liability cap is problematic enough that a trio of Democratic senators introduced legislation <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-03">Monday</TIMEX3> raising it to $ 10 billion , and the administration quickly announced its support .
Sens . Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida voiced concerns that unless the cap is raised , BP would avoid paying for the mess and leave small businesses , local government and fishermen with the bill .
` ` They 're not going to want to pay any more than what the law says they have to , '' Nelson said .
That 's not quite the seemingly ironclad guarantee heard from the president .
Then there 's the administration 's rhetoric about anticipating the magnitude of the crisis and bringing all resources to bear on Day One .
` ` We had -LRB- Defense Department -RRB- resources there from Day One .
This was a situation that was treated as a possible catastrophic failure from , from Day One , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . ''
That sense of urgency was not so apparent when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was questioned about the incident <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04-23">April 23</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three days</TIMEX3> after it occurred .
At the time he seemed to dismiss its severity and indicated it would n't affect Obama 's plans to open up new areas of the coast to offshore drilling .
` ` I do n't honestly think it opens up a whole new series of questions , because , you know , in all honesty I doubt this is the first accident that has happened
and I doubt it will be the last , '' Gibbs said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> later , Obama was announcing plans for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to review whether new technologies were needed to safeguard against oil spills from deep - water drilling rigs .
The president said no new offshore oil drilling leases would be issued without any such safeguards .
And Napolitano 's comments over <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-W17-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> about the Pentagon 's Day One role seemed a change from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">last Thursday</TIMEX3> , when she seemed to indicate the Defense Department was not yet involved in responding to the spill : ` ` If and when they have something to add , we 'll certainly make that known , '' she said .
A Homeland Security spokesman , Sean Smith , said Napolitano 's more <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> comments referred to the Navy 's help with the Coast Guard 's search and rescue mission early on , and that when she was discussing the Defense Department <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">last Thursday</TIMEX3> she was alluding to any additional help they could bring to bear .
The administration 's evolving rhetoric reflects not only the increasing seriousness of the spill itself , but its determination to be seen as responsive from the get - go and to squelch comparisons to the Bush administration 's slow - footed response to Hurricane Katrina .
It 's only natural that administration officials would adjust their response as the spill worsened and its seriousness became evident .
But they invite judgment when claiming they responded at 100 percent starting Day One to an incident whose magnitude was not yet apparent , or when black - and - white assertions about taxpayer protections turn out to be tinged with gray .
