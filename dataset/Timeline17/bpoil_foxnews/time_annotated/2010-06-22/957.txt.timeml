Massive Oil Spill Washes Ashore in the Gulf Millions of gallons of oil have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from a blown - out well at the site of the Deepwater Horizon , which exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> .
NEW ORLEANS -- Out - of - work Gulf Coast shrimper Todd Pellegal spent his first $ 2,500 check from BP quickly , paying off bills and buying groceries for his family .
He never even considered putting some of it away for taxes .
<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> he 's among the people up and down the Gulf Coast reeling from the oil spill disaster who are surprised -- and frustrated -- to find out the Internal Revenue Service may take a chunk of the payments BP PLC is providing to help them stay afloat .
Many were already angry about how long the oil giant took to cut the checks .
So when they got the money -- generally about a few thousand dollars each so far -- they spent it fast .
` ` If they 're going to pay you a lump sum , like for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , then bam , take the taxes out of the check , '' said Pellegal , of Boothville , La. ` ` But a little bit at a time , they should n't . ''
Accountants have been trying to nail down the implications for thousands of taxpayers after President Barack Obama said BP would create a $ 20 billion disaster fund and provide another $ 100 million for oil workers who lose their jobs because of the six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico .
Oil has been gushing into the sea since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
Tax experts said generally all income is taxable under federal law unless specific exemptions are approved by Congress or the Treasury Department -- and neither has acted yet on oil spill damage claims .
The IRS would not comment on whether exemptions would be made , citing a policy of not answering questions on specific tax issues .
Adding to the confusion , Kenneth Feinberg , who was chosen by President Barack Obama and BP to oversee the Independent Claims Facility , said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-18">Friday</TIMEX3> it has n't been determined if the payouts will be considered taxable income .
Some tax experts said they expected federal action soon to clarify the situation for Gulf Coast residents and business owners .
` ` With the experience we ' ve had with tornadoes and hurricanes , they know they need to address this , '' said John Ams , executive vice president of the Alexandria , Va.-based National Society of Accountants .
It 's not the first time the region has dealt with whether disaster money should be taxed .
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Louisiana and Mississippi residents received federal money to rebuild their homes after many claimed a casualty loss for the damage on the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> tax returns .
The IRS initially required people who received the money and took the deduction to add the value of the deduction to their 2007 returns as taxable income .
That decision angered many residents , including some who were pushed into a higher tax bracket as a result .
After residents and local leaders protested , Congress in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> voted to negate the IRS decision .
Without any such decision yet from federal authorities , tax experts are advising people getting BP payments to do a bit of advance planning and set aside some money .
` ` They should do a projection of their taxable income and determine if there is going to be a tax liability and have enough to cover that , '' said Crystal Faulkner , a partner in the Cincinnati - based accounting firm of Cooney Faulkner & Stevens LLC .
That does n't sit well with Cherie Edwards , who is <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> only working <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> at her job booking charter fishing trips at Zeke 's Landing in Orange Beach , Ala. .
The lost hours due to the oil spill are costing her about $ <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P270W">270 week</TIMEX3> .
She said she got her claim number from BP on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> and plans to file an application in the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming day</TIMEX3> .
So far , she said , no one has mentioned to her about a potential tax liability .
