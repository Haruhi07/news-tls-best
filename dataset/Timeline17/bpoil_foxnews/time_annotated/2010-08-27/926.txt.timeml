NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS --
The U.S. government said engineers will start work <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-08-30">Monday</TIMEX3> to remove the temporary cap that stopped oil from gushing out of BP 's blown - out Gulf well so that crews can raise a key piece of equipment from the seabed .
Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the spill response , told reporters <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-08-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that engineers must remove the cap so they can raise the failed blowout preventer .
The blowout preventer is considered a key piece of evidence in determining what caused the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> rig explosion that unleashed the gushing oil .
The leak was first contained when engineers were able to place a cap atop BP 's well .
Workers then pumped mud and cement in through the top in a so - called ` ` static kill '' operation that significantly reduced pressure inside the well .
Officials do n't expect oil to leak into the sea again when the cap is removed , but Allen has ordered BP to be ready to collect any leaking crude just in case .
The Department of Justice and other federal investigators are overseeing the work to remove the blowout preventer , Allen said .
The 50 - foot -LRB- 15 - meter -RRB- , 600,000 - pound -LRB- 272,000 - kilogram -RRB- device -- which was designed to prevent such a catastrophe -- will be taken out of the water with the well pipe still inside to ensure the pipe does n't break apart any more than it already has .
Keeping the blowout preventer intact is important because it 's considered an essential piece of evidence in determining what caused the blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .
After the explosion , 206 million gallons -LRB- 800 million liters -RRB- of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico until the temporary cap stopped the flow .
The explosion on the rig -- which was owned by Transocean Ltd. and being operated by BP PLC -- killed 11 workers .
Engineers are hoping the blowout preventer can be detached easily , but they are prepared to exert 80,000 pounds -LRB- 36,000 kilograms -RRB- of pressure if needed , Allen said .
A new blowout preventer will be placed atop the well once the one that failed is raised .
After that , the goal is to drill the final 50 feet -LRB- 15 meters -RRB- of a relief well beginning <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-09-07">Sept. 7</TIMEX3> , Allen said .
From there , it will take <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P4D" mod="APPROX">about four days</TIMEX3> for drilling crews to reach their target .
The relief well has been called the ultimate solution to plugging the well .
Once the relief well is drilled , engineers will be able to pump mud and cement in through the bottom of the well , plugging the one that gushed oil once and for all .
Meanwhile , the U.S. government said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-08-27">Friday</TIMEX3> that it is reopening more federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for commercial and recreational fishing that had been closed because of the spill .
The government is reopening 4,281 square miles -LRB- 11,000 sq . kilometers -RRB- of waters off the coast of western Louisiana .
Oil sheen has not been seen there since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-29">July 29</TIMEX3> , and scientists found no oil or dispersants on samples of the area 's shrimp and fish .
Twenty percent of federal waters in the Gulf remain closed .
` ` We 're sort of nibbling at the edges if you will , areas that have been free of oil for the longest time and were oiled the least , '' Lubchenco said .
The news came as hearings continued in Houston before the joint U.S. Coast Guard - Bureau of Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement investigative panel .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-08-27">Friday</TIMEX3> , Mark Hafle -- a BP drilling engineer who was a key decision maker at the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - sunken rig -- exercised his constitutional right to refuse to testify .
The panel 's goal is to determine what caused the explosion .
The panel also will make recommendations to prevent such a catastrophe in the future .
