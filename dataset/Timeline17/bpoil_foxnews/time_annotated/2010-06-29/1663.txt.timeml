WASHINGTON --
WASHINGTON -LRB-
AP -RRB- --
The Minerals Management Service -- well , the name anyway -- <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> sits on the scrap heap of discarded monikers alongside ValuJet , Blackwater and Enron Field .
Not that a new name makes it any easier for the Obama administration to convince a skeptical Congress that the agency will be any better at policing offshore drilling .

The new name , the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- or BOE for short -- is designed to emphasize regulatory and enforcement responsibilities of the troubled agency , which is part of the Interior Department .
The change comes in the wake of the disastrous BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
MMS had been panned for its lax oversight of offshore drilling .

A <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> report by the department 's inspector general said that its drilling regulators have been so close to the industry that they ' ve accepted gifts from oil and gas companies and even negotiated to go work for the companies .
Michael R. Bromwich , the new head of the MMS -- er , BOE -- assured Congress that the change is much more than cosmetic .
` ` I think it 's substantive , '' Bromwich said .
` ` Regulation and enforcement have been added to the title of the agency because those elements , I think , by consensus have been lacking in the approach of the agency . ''
One marketing expert told The Associated Press that the Obama administration has made a mistake by changing the name at a time when the agency is still the focus of negative attention .
The danger , said Kelly O'Keefe , managing director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Brandcenter , is that the new name gets tarnished with the old baggage .
` ` If you 're trying to dodge a negative situation , it is a very bad idea to do that in the middle of that negative situation , '' O'Keefe said .
` ` Because what happens is the bad news is n't over -- it certainly is n't for MMS or BP . ''
` ` It 's really hard to pull a fake - out , to say , ` Hey , we 're something different <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , ' ''
O'Keefe added .
` ` We tend to see through that . ''
Or , as ` ` The Daily Show '' host Jon Stewart deadpanned <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">last week</TIMEX3> , ` ` Are we really that stupid ? ''
` ` This is n't just a name change or branding exercise , '' said Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff .
The new name , she said , reflects Interior Secretary Ken Salazar 's mission for the agency as it undergoes reorganization .
Salazar plans to break up the agency into three separate entities to eliminate conflicts of interest .
Government agencies have been changing their names since the beginning of the republic .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1789">1789</TIMEX3> , just <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXM">a few months</TIMEX3> into its existence , the Department of Foreign Affairs became the State Department .
According to the State Department website , that switch was made because the agency took over several new domestic responsibilities , such as custody of the Great Seal of the United States .
For most of its existence , the Army was known as the Department of War .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1947">1947</TIMEX3> , it was converted to the Department of the Army and grouped with the Navy and newly created Air Force under a new National Military Establishment , headed by the new secretary of defense .
Congress changed the National Military Establishment into the Department of Defense <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1949">two years later</TIMEX3> , with significantly more authority for the defense secretary .
In its <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1947">1947</TIMEX3> report on the legislation unifying the military services , the Senate Committee on Armed Services said it had been guided by ` ` the basic objectives of our government -LRB- 1 -RRB- to maintain the peace and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to remove the causes of war .
In support of those objectives it is essential that there be established a structure fully capable of safeguarding our national security promptly and effectively . ''
Harvey Sapolsky , retired director of security studies and professor emeritus of public policy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said ridding the term ` ` war '' back then was not about making the department sound less bellicose .
` ` We might see differences in ` war ' and ` defense , ' but I do n't think they did , '' he said .
Instead , the change was motivated by efficiency , coordination and creating an Air Force .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P3DE">Three decades</TIMEX3> after the Department of War was no more , the government excised ` ` welfare '' from another department 's name .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1980">1980</TIMEX3> , the new Department of Education was born , while the old Health , Education and Welfare Department became the Health and Human Services Department .
` ` Welfare '' was nowhere to be found in the title of either department -- <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P16Y">16 years</TIMEX3> before President Bill Clinton signed legislation to fulfill a campaign promise to ` ` end welfare as we know it . ''
Sometimes the rebranding can mean adding a key word .
<TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">Last week</TIMEX3> , President Barack Obama signed an executive order renaming the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports .
The new name , the President 's Council on Fitness , Sports and Nutrition , was made to emphasize healthy eating habits , dovetailing with first lady Michelle Obama 's campaign against childhood obesity .
The council has a jazzed - up website , with photos , videos and the words ` ` You 're it .
That was n't even its first name change .
When President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the council in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1956">1956</TIMEX3> , he called it the President 's Council on Youth Fitness .
When it comes to MMS , Stewart questioned the need for a new name .
` ` Why do n't we just rename the water in the Gulf ` H20 Black ' ? ''
