BP tried the ` ` top hat , '' the ` ` junk shot '' and the ` ` top kill , '' but with the success of its new cap on the busted well in the Gulf of Mexico , it looks like the oil giant is <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> trying out a Job Kill .
BP has suddenly stopped awarding contracts for oil skimmers and protective boom to combat the spill in the Gulf , leaving hundreds of contractors out of work , an industry source told Fox News .
DRC Group , which has more than 480 vessels in the Gulf laying boom and skimming crude in shallow waters , let go about 50 percent of its workers <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">this week</TIMEX3> after BP changed course , the source said .
The Alabama - based emergency contractors have been employing more than 750 fishermen , oystermen and oil response technicians since the spill began and have laid 100 miles of boom to prevent oil from reaching the vulnerable shoreline .
But after <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P85D">85 days</TIMEX3> of crisis work , BP finally capped its broken well <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">last week</TIMEX3> , and appears to have changed its calculus in contracting work to manage the effects of the spill , the source said .
There is still an enormous amount of oil in the water to be skimmed or contained with boom , but the source suggested they are backing off on those efforts .
Many fishermen who have been employed in oil cleanup projects had been otherwise driven out of work by the oil spill .
BP never signed contracts <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P5D" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five days</TIMEX3> out because it did n't want to be left with outstanding liabilities if the situation at sea changed abruptly , the source said .
