<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-30">June 30</TIMEX3> : Hurricane Alex is seen lashing the Mexico coastline , south of Brownsville , Texas .
NOAA Alex may have cooled off , but hurricane season is just starting to heat up in the Gulf of Mexico .
And absurdly warm oceans combined with still air mean storms will continue .
Could Bonnie , Colin , Danielle and the rest of the forthcoming storms spell disaster for BP 's oil spill ?
Three major forecasts from the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- , Accuweather and Colorado State have all called for dramatic hurricane seasons <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
Those predictions are n't particularly meaningful , oddly enough -- and that comes straight from the forecasters themselves .
` ` The seasonal forecasts are of interest to a lot of people , but they 're not terribly accurate , '' admitted James Franklin , branch chief of the NHC 's Hurricane Specialists Unit .
And not particularly meaningful , he says .
` ` Even if we did do a real good job hitting it year after year , it does n't give you a good indication of where storms are going to go . ''
Still , the guidance is useful .

And if the first Atlantic hurricane of the season is just a taste of the season to come , we 're in for a bumpy -- and lengthy -- season .
So what causes hurricanes , and why is this season so dangerous ?
` ` The basic idea of a hurricane is one of a heat engine , '' Franklin told FoxNews.com .
It converts the energy of the ocean into gale force winds .
And <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> , the ocean has far more energy than usual .
When waters are above about 80 degrees , conditions are ripe for hurricanes , and they can get much hotter in the tropics .
` ` Waters in the tropical Atlantic between Africa and the Lesser Antilles are just about as warm as we ' ve ever seen them , '' he said .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> update to their annual forecast , Colorado State 's Philip J. Klotzbach and William M. Gray describe them as ` ` running at near - record warm levels . ''
For a hurricane to be created , some pre - existing disturbance near Africa , a low - pressure system for example , forms the spark from which the hurricane will ignite .
That tropical weakness moves out into the balmy waters of the Atlantic and gasses up .
The second big factor is wind .
Strong winds in the upper air disperse tropical waves , disrupting hurricane formation and scattering pent - up heat .
The NHC is predicting much more favorable wind patterns <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> than <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> -- La Nina or neutral conditions , as opposed to the El Nino conditions of strong winds from <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> .
` ` In order to make a hurricane go , the heat coming from the ocean and released in a rising motion in the atmosphere has to be concentrated in one place .
If winds in the atmosphere are blowing in different directions , that disperses heat . ''
So having uniform winds is important -- and a rare event .
Dry air also means water vapor ca n't condense , clouds do n't gather , rain does n't fall and hurricanes do n't form .
A third factor is the cyclical nature of the weather .
Hurricane activity tends to run in long , 20 - to 30 - year cycles .
Since <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1995">1995</TIMEX3> , we ' ve been in a cycle of increased activity .
Alex did n't move over the Gulf oil spill directly , so scientists and meteorologists were unable to directly observe the effects of the weather on the oil .
But Franklin thinks we 'll see winds dispersing the oil -- something BP has actively tried to do itself .
In that sense , hurricane season may be a blessing for the oil crisis .
` ` If the storm tracks to the west of the oil , there is the potential that the counter - clockwise circulation of the hurricane could drive some of the oil further toward the U.S. Gulf Coast .
Alternatively , a storm tracking to the east of the oil could push the oil further offshore .
But , little is understood about the interaction of tropical cyclones and oil , '' the scientists write .
Fortunately , there 's no evidence to suggest storms will suck the crude into the clouds , creating a foul rain of oil on coasts .
But weather forecasters do n't know enough at present to really predict what will happen .
And Franklin is optimistic that BP technicians will cap the well and clean the oil before what - ifs turn into learning situations .
` ` Hopefully we wo n't learn anything about it . ''
