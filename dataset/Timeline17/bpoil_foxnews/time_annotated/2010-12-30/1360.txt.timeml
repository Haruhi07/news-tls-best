NEW ORLEANS --
A law professor being paid $ 950 <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> with BP 's money has declared that the czar of the $ 20 billion claims fund for Gulf oil spill victims is independent of the oil giant .
Fund administrator Ken Feinberg said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-12-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> he has agreed to pay New York University professor Stephen Gillers for his advice .
Since being hired , Gillers has written a letter stating that Feinberg is neutral and not subject to BP 's direction or control .
Feinberg said the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , created to administer payments from the fund to people and businesses , is billing BP for Gillers ' services .
Some victims , lawyers and state officials unhappy with the claims process have questioned Feinberg 's independence and suggested he is a pawn in a BP effort to limit its liability .
A statement <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-12-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility said Feinberg asked Gillers for advice about a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-11-24">Nov. 24</TIMEX3> letter from Louisiana Attorney General James ` ` Buddy '' Caldwell questioning the independence of the fund and Feinberg 's role as the independent administrator .
In a letter to Feinberg , Gillers wrote : ` ` You are not in an attorney - client relationship with BP .
You are an independent administrator and owe none of the attributes of the attorney - client relationship -LRB-
e.g. , loyalty , confidentiality -RRB- to BP .

By ` independent ' I mean -LRB-
and I think the context is clear -RRB- that you are independent of BP .
You are not subject to its direction or control . ''
The total amount Gillers will be paid is unclear .
He told The Associated Press he is billing $ 950 <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> for his services and an assistant is billing $ 475 <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> .
Gillers said he and the assistant have not calculated exactly how <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">many hours</TIMEX3> they spent on the work , which Gillers said is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> finished .
GCCF spokeswoman Debra DeShong Reed said neither Feinberg nor the fund have any past relationship with Gillers .
She said he was chosen because he is a nationally recognized expert in the field of legal ethics .
Gillers said his work for Feinberg included reading the letter Caldwell sent Feinberg , reading court papers filed by lawyers suing BP , and researching rules governing lawyers in Gulf Coast states and in Washington , where Feinberg 's law firm is located .
Both Gillers and Feinberg said they do n't believe there is anything wrong with using BP money to pay for the advice .
` ` Is he being paid by BP money ?
Yes , '' Feinberg said .
` ` Who else is going to pay for the entire cost of this program ?
You ca n't ask claimants to pay , you ca n't ask states and federal governments to pay .
The buck stops with BP and BP has agreed to pay the entire cost of the infrastructure of this program . ''
But Anthony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , Ala. , has questions about the relationship between Feinberg and BP .
` ` He can proclaim independence as much as he wants , '' said Kennon , whose community was hard hit by the oil spill .
` ` The only thing that will show true independence is if he makes those people whole who were harmed by the oil spill .
We have not been made whole by a long shot . ''
Lawyers who have already filed more than 300 lawsuits on behalf of Gulf residents and businesses say Feinberg should stop calling himself independent .
They asked a federal judge <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-W51">last week</TIMEX3> to order changes to the release form people must sign if they accept a final payment from Feinberg .
Feinberg <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> requires people who accept final payments to agree not to sue BP or any other responsible party , including companies involved with the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> off Louisiana 's coast .
The blast killed 11 workers and led to 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico , according to government estimates that BP disputes .
The lawyers say people should only have to give up the right to sue BP for compensatory damages , but they should still be allowed to go after BP in court for punitive damages .
And , the lawyers say , people who accept final payments from the fund should be allowed to sue other responsible parties for both compensatory and punitive damages .
So far , the fund has paid out roughly $ 2.6 billion .
Money left over in the fund is expected to be returned to BP .
