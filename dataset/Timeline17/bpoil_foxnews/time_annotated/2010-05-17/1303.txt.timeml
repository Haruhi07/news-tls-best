The head of the Interior Department 's embattled oil and gas drilling program announced <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> he is retiring at the end of the month , a move that comes as the agency he runs faces a shake - up following the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Chris Oynes , the associated director of the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program within the Mineral Management Service at the Interior Department , announced his departure in an e - mail to his staff .
President Obama , meanwhile , has decided to have a presidential commission investigate the cause of the rig explosion that unleashed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , where engineers are struggling after <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3W">three weeks</TIMEX3> to stop the flow .
The presidential panel will be similar to ones that examined the Challenger space shuttle disaster and Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident , said a White House official , speaking on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been formally announced .
Oynes is responsible for the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas program , as well as developing and implementing the new alternative energy program .
Oynes ' biography on the Mineral Manager Service 's website notes that he has been involved in how the agency conducts its resource projections , environmental reviews and operational safeguards .
He also was directly responsible for 30 lease sales .
The agency specifically has been accused of being too cozy with the oil and gas lessees it oversees .
In Congress , more attention was focused on the Gulf spill .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif .
, and seven other senators asked the Justice Department to determine whether BP PLC made false and misleading claims to the government about its ability to prevent a serious oil spill when it applied for permission <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> to drill the Deepwater Horizon well that has unleashed environmental havoc along the Gulf coast .
But lawmakers are taking aim not only at BP at hearings <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">this week</TIMEX3> , but also the Interior Department 's regulation of offshore drilling that allowed BP to operate without assurance a massive spill could be prevented .
Anticipating tough questioning on Capitol Hill at hearings <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">this week</TIMEX3> , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> announced a tightening of requirements for onshore oil and gas drilling .
The new measures would not apply to oil rigs at sea .
` ` The BP oil spill is a stark reminder of how we must continue to push ahead with the reforms we have been working on and which we know are needed , '' Salazar said .
Oynes is the first person to resign at his agency since an <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sunk the rig and caused the massive oil spill .
The spill continues to grow as oil officials and federal authorities race to stop the flow and protect the coast .
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif .
, ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , issued a statement saying that Oynes ' departure is a start .
` ` For <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3> spanning three administrations , MMS has been a corrupt agency with an extensive history of mismanagement .
This was n't the doing of one , single person , but rather the culmination of a bureaucratic breakdown .
Removing one person might be a start , but MMS is in need of an exhaustive overhaul and comprehensive reform , '' Issa said .
