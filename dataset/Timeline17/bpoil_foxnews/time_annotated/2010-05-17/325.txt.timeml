An image from a video of a jagged pipe leaking millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , recorded by a BP camera a mile below the water 's surface .
BP BP 's mile - long tube is only collecting about one - fifth of the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , its executives said <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The energy giant 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said the tube has been siphoning more than 1,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , or 42,000 gallons , in an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Monday</TIMEX3> with NBC 's ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">Today</TIMEX3> Show . ''
BP has estimated about 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , or 210,000 gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , has been leaking out .
Suttles said they hope to be able to collect more oil as they ramp up the effort but they wo n't be able to get all of it .
In a major step toward containing the massive oil leak , BP PLC crews on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> hooked up the tube to funnel the crude into a tanker ship .
However , millions of gallons of crude are already in the Gulf .
The contraption was hooked up successfully and sucking oil from a pipe at the blown well <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-05-16TAF">Sunday afternoon</TIMEX3> after being hindered by several setbacks .
Engineers remotely guiding robot submersibles had worked since <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-14">Friday</TIMEX3> to place the tube into a 21 - inch -LRB- 53 - centimeter -RRB- pipe nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the sea .
Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president for exploration and production , said during a news conference that the amount being drawn was gradually increasing , and it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> to measure it .
Company spokesman Mark Proegler at the joint spill command center in Louisiana had initially said the tube was containing most of the oil coming from the pipe , which is contributing an estimated 85 percent of the crude in the spill .
In a statement <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> , BP said that the tube was ` ` successfully tested and inserted into the leaking riser , capturing some amounts of oil and gas . ''
` ` While not collecting all of the leaking oil , this tool is an important step in reducing the amount of oil being released into Gulf waters , '' BP said .
Previous attempts to use emergency valves and a 100 - ton container had failed to stop the leak that has spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , threatening sea life , commercial fishing and the coastal tourism industry from Louisiana to Florida .
BP PLC has also been burning small amounts of floating oil and spraying chemical dispersants above and below the surface .
The tube 's success gave crews partial control of the leak for the first time in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three weeks</TIMEX3> .
Oil has been spewing since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 people and sinking <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> .
The government shortly afterward estimated the spill at 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 liters -RRB- -- or 5,000 barrels -- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , a figure that has since been questioned by some scientists who fear it could be far more .
BP executives have stood by the estimate while acknowledging there 's no way to know for sure .
Researchers warned <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> that miles - long -LRB- kilometers - long -RRB- underwater plumes of oil from the spill could poison and suffocate sea life across the food chain , with damage that could endure for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1DE">a decade</TIMEX3> or more .
Researchers have found more underwater plumes of oil than they can count from the blown - out well , said Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia .
She said careful measurements taken of one plume showed it stretching for 10 miles -LRB- 16 kilometers -RRB- , with a 3 - mile -LRB- 5 - kilometer -RRB- width .
The hazardous effects of the plume are twofold .
Joye said the oil itself can prove toxic to fish swimming in the sea , while vast amount of oxygen are also being sucked from the water by microbes that eat oil .
Dispersants used to fight the oil are also food for the microbes , speeding up the oxygen depletion .
` ` So , first you have oily water that may be toxic to certain organisms and also the oxygen issue , so there are two problems here , '' said Joye , who 's working with a group of scientists who discovered the underwater plumes in a <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> boat expedition to the Gulf .
` ` This can interrupt the food chain at the lowest level , and will trickle up and certainly impact organisms higher .
Whales , dolphins and tuna all depend on lower depths to survive . ''
She said it could take years or even decades for the ecosystem to recover .
BP has been casting about for ways to contain the leak since it was discovered <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> after the blast .
First robot submarines were unable to get valves to work on machinery at the well head called the blowout preventer .
Then the company failed to capture the oil with a 100 - ton box after icelike crystals formed in it .
A relief well , considered the permanent solution the leak , is still being drilled and is months away from completion .
