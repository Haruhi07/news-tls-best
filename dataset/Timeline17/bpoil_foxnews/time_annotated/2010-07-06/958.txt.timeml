<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">July 5</TIMEX3> : A sample jar of tar balls found on Crystal Beach and Galveston 's East Beach during the holiday weekend are displayed during a news conference .
Michael Paulsen , Houston Chronicle via AP The latest hopes to clean oil near the spewing well in the Gulf of Mexico rests on this massive new skimmer dubbed ' A Whale . '
Residents along the Texas coast are holding out hope that the tar balls washing up on their shores are not a sign of what 's to come .
A bucket 's worth of tar balls was discovered over <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W26-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> along the shores of Gavelston , Texas -- <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P2M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than two months</TIMEX3> after oil gushing from a blown - out well on the ocean floor first reached Louisiana .
Authorities , however , said <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-06">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that they do not know whether the tar balls found in Texas were dropped from a contaminated ship passing through the waters .
Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski said he believed the tar balls were a fluke , rather than a sign of what 's to come .
` ` This is good news , '' he said .
` ` The water looks good .
We 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly . ''
The crude from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is still moving , but the fleet of skimmers tapped to clean the worst - hit areas of the Gulf of Mexico is not .
A string of small storms has made the water too choppy for the boats to operate for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week</TIMEX3> off Florida , Alabama and Mississippi .
The number of tar balls discovered in Texas is tiny compared with what has coated beaches so far in other Gulf states .
Still , it still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble .
` ` Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab , '' Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said in a news release .
The oil 's arrival in Texas was predicted <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-07-02">Friday</TIMEX3> by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which gave a 40 percent chance of crude reaching the area .
` ` It was just a matter of time that some of the oil would find its way to Texas , '' said Hans Graber , a marine physicist at the University of Miami and co - director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing .
About 5 gallons of tar balls were found <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-03">Saturday</TIMEX3> on the Bolivar Peninsula , northeast of Galveston , said Capt .
Marcus Woodring , the Coast Guard commander for the Houston\/Galveston sector .
Two gallons were found <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-04">Sunday</TIMEX3> on the peninsula and Galveston Island , though tests have not yet confirmed the oil 's origin .
Woodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill .

But there 's no way to confirm how they got there .
Hurricane Alex , which blew through the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">last week</TIMEX3> and made landfall along the border between Texas and Mexico , may have played a small role in bringing the oil ashore in Texas by increasing the westerly <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> near land , Graber said .
But it was more likely due to normal coastal currents and local weather patterns .
NOAA scientists are looking at local weather , Hurricane Alex and Gulf vessels as possible sources for the tar balls , agency spokeswoman Monica Allen said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles .
Oil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">April 29</TIMEX3> .
The spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana .
Strings of oil were seen <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07-05">Monday</TIMEX3> in the Rigolets , one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain , the large lake north of New Orleans .
` ` So far it 's scattered stuff showing up , mostly tar balls , '' said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina .
` ` It will pull out with the tide , and then show back up . ''
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said assets would be deployed to protect the Lake Pontchartrain basin .
Pausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake , taking a backdoor route to New Orleans .
The news of the spill 's reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds .
A tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="TIME" value="2010-07-05TAF">Monday afternoon</TIMEX3> , bringing heavy rain and winds .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">Last week</TIMEX3> , the faraway Hurricane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama , Florida and Mississippi with choppy seas and stiff winds .
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they 're idled by the smaller storms that could last well into <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-W27">this week</TIMEX3> .
Officials have plans for the worst - case scenario : a hurricane barreling up the Gulf toward the spill site .
But the less - dramatic weather conditions have been met with a more makeshift response .
Skimming across the Gulf has scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil - fouled water so far , but officials say it 's impossible to know how much crude could have been sucked up in good weather because of the fluctuating number of boats and other variables .
Jerry Biggs , a commercial fisherman in Pass Christian , Miss. , who has had to shut down because of the spill , is <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> hiring out his 13 boats and 40 - man crew to BP for cleanup .
He said skimming is severely hampered by the weather .
` ` This is n't going away .
This is n't a sneeze or a hiccup .
This is diarrhea for a long time , '' he said .
` ` My lifestyle is screwed .
The thing that I love the most I ' m not going to be able to do anymore . ''
The British company has <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> seen its costs from the spill reach $ 3.12 billion , a figure that does n't include a $ 20 billion fund for damages the company created <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-06">last month</TIMEX3> .
The storms have not affected drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak .
The company expects drilling to be finished by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
