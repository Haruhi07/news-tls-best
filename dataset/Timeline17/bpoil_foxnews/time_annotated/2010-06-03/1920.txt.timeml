For days <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , Dr. Damon Dietrich and other physicians have seen patients come through their emergency room at West Jefferson Medical Center with similar symptoms : respiratory problems , headaches and nausea .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">the past week</TIMEX3> , 11 workers who have been out on the water cleaning up oil from BP 's blown - out well have been treated for what Dietrich calls ` ` a pattern of symptoms '' that could have been caused by the burning of crude oil , noxious fumes from the oil or the dispersants dumped in the Gulf to break it up .
All workers were treated and released .
` ` One person comes in , it could be multiple things , '' he said .
` ` Eleven people come in with these symptoms , it makes it incredibly suspicious . ''
Few studies have examined long - term health effects of oil exposure .
But some of the workers trolling Gulf Coast beaches and heading out into the marshes and waters have complained about flu - like symptoms -- a similar complaint among crews deployed for the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska .
BP and U.S. Coast Guard officials have said dehydration , heat , food poisoning or other unrelated factors may have caused the workers ' symptoms .
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is investigating .
Brief contact with small amounts of light crude oil and dispersants are not harmful .
Swallowing small amounts of oil can cause upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea .
Long - term exposure to dispersants , however , can cause central nervous system problems , or do damage to blood , kidneys or livers , according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6W">the six weeks</TIMEX3> since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , killing 11 workers , an estimated 21 million to 45 million gallons of crude has poured into the Gulf of Mexico .
Hundreds of BP contractors have fanned out along the Gulf , deploying boom , spraying chemicals to break up the oil , picking up oil - soaked debris and trying to keep the creeping slick out of the sensitive marshes and away from the tourist - Mecca beaches .
Commercial fisherman John Wunstell Jr. spent a night on a vessel near the source of the spill and left complaining of a severe headache , upset stomach and nose bleed .
He was treated at the hospital , and sued -- becoming part of a class - action lawsuit filed <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05">last month</TIMEX3> in U.S. District Court in New Orleans against BP , Transocean and their insurers .
Wunstell , who was part of a crew burning oil , believes planes were spraying dispersant in the middle of the night -- something BP disputes .
` ` I began to ache all over ... ''
he said in the affidavit .
` ` I was completely unable to function at this point and feared that I was seriously ill . ''
Dozens of complaints , most from spill workers , have been made related to oil exposure with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals , said spokeswoman Olivia Watkins , as well as with the Louisiana Poison Center , clinics and hospitals .
Workers are being told to follow federal guidelines that recommend anyone involved in oil spill cleanup wear protective equipment such as gloves , safety glasses and clothing .
Michael J. Schneider , an attorney who decided against filing a class - action lawsuit in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="199">the 1990s</TIMEX3> involving the Valdez workers , said proving a link between oil exposure and health problems is very difficult .
` ` As a human being you listen to enough and you ' ve got to believe they 're true , '' he said .
` ` The problem is the science may not be there to support them ...
Many of the signs and symptoms these people complained of are explainable for a dozen different reasons -- it 's certainly coincidental they all shared a reason in common . ''
Similar to the Valdez cleanup , there have been concerns in the Gulf that workers are n't being supplied with enough protective gear .
Workers have been spotted in white jumpsuits , gloves and booties but no goggles or respirators .
` ` If they 're out there getting lightheaded and dizzy <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> then obviously they ought to come in , and there should be respirators and other equipment provided , '' said LuAnn White , director of the Tulane Center for Applied Environmental Public Health .
She added that most of the volatile components that could sicken people generally evaporate before the oil reaches shore .
BP PLC 's Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said reports of workers getting sick are being investigated but noted that no one has pinpointed the cause .
Suttles said workers were being given ` ` any safety equipment '' needed to do their jobs safely .
Unlike with Exxon Valdez , in the Gulf , the oil has been lighter , the temperatures warm and humid , and there have been hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals used to break up the oil .
Court records showed more than 6,700 workers involved in the Exxon Valdez clean up suffered respiratory problems which the company attributed to a viral illness , not chemical poisoning .
Dennis Mestas represented the only known worker to successfully settle with Exxon over health issues .
According to the terms of that confidential settlement , Exxon did not admit fault .
His client , Gary Stubblefield , spent <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3> lifting workers in a crane for <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="PT18H">18 hours</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> as they sprayed the oil - slicked beaches with hot water , which created an oily mist .
Even though he had to wipe clean his windshield <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="SET" value="P1D" freq="2">twice a day</TIMEX3> , Stubblefield said it never occurred to him that the mixture might be harming his lungs .
Within weeks , he and others , who wore little to no protective gear , were coughing and experiencing other symptoms that were eventually nicknamed Valdez crud .

<TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> 60 , Stubblefield can not get through a short conversation without coughing and gasping for breath like a drowning man .
He sometimes needs the help of a breathing machine and inhalers , and has to be careful not to choke when he drinks and eats .
Watching the Gulf situation unfold , he says , makes him sick .
