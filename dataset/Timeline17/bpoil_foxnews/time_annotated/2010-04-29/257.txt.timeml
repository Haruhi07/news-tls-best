<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-04-29">April 29 , 2010</TIMEX3> :
Workers in Orange Beach , Ala. , lay inflatable orange booms to protect the beach and wildlife against a massive oil spill nearing the coastline .
Fox News As a massive oil slick creeps ever closer to the Gulf Coast , officials in Louisiana , Alabama , Texas , Mississippi and Florida are bracing for the worst .

The economic impact over miles of prime coast land has the potential to be catastrophic .
Officials say the slick from <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> 's offshore drilling rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico may have a devastating impact on one of the coastal states ' most precious commodities -- shrimp -- and the entire industry that surrounds it .

And state officials acknowledge that the oil 's effect on travel and tourism to the area could be equally destructive .
` ` Common sense would tell us that if the shrimp and oyster beds are impacted , that could potentially affect one of the signature items for Louisiana -- our shrimp , '' Louisiana 's assistant secretary of tourism , Jim Hutchinson , told FoxNews.com .
About 5,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> are coming up from the seabed after a BP - operated rig , the Deepwater Horizon , exploded and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> about 40 miles offshore , leaving 11 workers missing and presumed dead .
Federal officials say the leading edge of the spill was expected to reach the Mississippi River delta by <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="TIME" value="2010-04-29TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> .
In an interview with FoxNews.com , Deborah Long , spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said the oil could have a ` ` dramatic effect '' on the shrimp industry 's ability to stay in business .
` ` There 's a deep concern about the potential effects of the spill on the shrimp stocks , '' Long said , adding that the U.S. shrimp industry and BP have deployed booms and other resources as a precautionary measure to protect the shrimp , which commercial fishermen depend on to make a living .
Long said that the spill 's impact on the industry depends on a ` ` number of variables , '' which she said ` ` are still unknowns at this point . ''
The volume of the spill , as well as the outcome of the containment efforts , will be key in determining the damage that the oil slick will have on the country 's most fertile seafood grounds .
The shrimp season begins in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05" mod="START">early May</TIMEX3> , as the shrimp move from estuaries out to sea , Long said .
U.S. landings of shrimp were valued at $ 441.8 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> -- an increase of $ 9.1 million compared to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> .
Louisiana leads the nation in its shrimp supply -- with 89 million pounds produced in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> -- followed by Texas , Alabama , Florida and Mississippi .
Hutchinson said that while the effect on wildlife and the fragile ecosystem along the coastline remains the ` ` area of biggest and immediate concern , '' officials are hoping that the travel and tourism industries in the region will not also be devastated by the oil spill .
The Gulf states play host to tourists from around the world , and industry officials acknowledge that the spill could have a massive economic impact .
In states like Florida , where tourism is a $ 65.5 billion industry , and Alabama , which brings in $ 6 billion , officials are closely monitoring any changes in hotel bookings and travel plans .
Mike Foster , vice president of marketing at the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau in Orange Beach , Ala. , said he spoke <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-04-28">Wednesday</TIMEX3> with two major hotel and condominium partners and found few changes in reservations .
` ` There are very few cancellations '' at this time , he told FoxNews.com .
Orange Beach , Ala. , saw about 1.3 million visitors from <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , raking in $ 533 million in travel expenses , including food , lodging and recreation .
Foster and Hutchinson both stressed that it is too early to speculate the impact , if any , of the oil slick on the travel and tourism industry .
` ` It 's a tragedy on so many different levels , '' Hutchinson said .
` ` As far as specific tourism concerns , none have been broached directly with me . ''
