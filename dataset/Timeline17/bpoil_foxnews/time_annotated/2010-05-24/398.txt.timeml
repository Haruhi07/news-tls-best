<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-22">May 22</TIMEX3> : Oil from the Deepwater Horizon wellhead washes up on the beach of Elmer 's Island , a wildlife refuge , owned and maintained by the state of Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- .
BARATARIA BAY , La. -- The executive in charge of fighting a Gulf of Mexico oil spill acknowledged <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> everyone is frustrated at BP 's failure to plug the ocean gusher <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a month</TIMEX3> into a disaster that is spreading damage in Louisiana 's wetlands , including miring pelican colonies .
Doug Suttles , chief operating officer at BP PLC , went on all three U.S. network morning talks shows with the same message : BP knows frustration is growing that it has n't been able to halt the spill of millions of gallons of oil from a well that blew out after a rig explosion <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> off the Lousiana coast .
` ` We are doing everything we can , everything I know , '' Suttles said on the NBC ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Today</TIMEX3> '' show .
The Obama administration questioned BP 's competence <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> , when Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told reporters he was ` ` not completely '' confident that BP knows what it 's doing .
` ` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' Salazar said .
Asked about Salazar 's criticism , Suttles said BP is working with experts from other oil companies and the government to find a solution .
` ` What I do know is , everyone is frustrated .
I think the people of the region are frustrated .
I know we are , I know the government is , '' Suttles said on NBC .
` ` The fact that it 's taken this long is painful to everybody . ''
Suttles said on ABC 's '' Good Morning America '' that BP 's next shot at plugging the well <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> stands a very good chance of success .
But he said the global oil company has more plans in case the latest efforts fails , like several before it .
BP plans to use heavy mud and cement to stop the breach , a maneuver called a top kill .
Suttles said on the CBS ` ` Early Show '' the effort should start <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2010-05-19TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> and they 'll know <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-19">the same day</TIMEX3> if it works .
The White House said <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> the Justice Department has been gathering information about the oil spill .
Press secretary Robert Gibbs did n't say whether the department has opened a criminal investigation .
He would only tell CBS ' ` ` Face the Nation '' that department representatives have been to the Gulf as part of the response to the oil leak .
Salazar and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> to fly over affected areas .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-24">Monday</TIMEX3> its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million , including containment efforts , drilling a relief well to stop the leak permanently , grants to Gulf states for their response costs and paying damage claims .
BP said it 's too early to calculate other potential costs and liabilities .
Even if BP 's top kill procedure works <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> , the damage has been done .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> , some brown pelicans coated in oil could n't fly away on Barataria Bay of the Louisiana coast .
All they could do was hobble .
Their usually brown and white feathers were jet black , and eggs were glazed with rust - colored gunk .
When wildlife officials tried to rescue one of the pelicans , the birds became spooked .
Officials were n't sure whether they would try again , and U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Stacy Shelton said it is sometimes better to leave the animals alone than to disturb their colony .
Pelicans are especially vulnerable to oil because they dive into the water to feed .
They could eat tainted fish and feed it to their young , or they could die of hypothermia or drown if their feathers become soaked in oil .
Just <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-11">six months ago</TIMEX3> , the birds had been removed from the federal endangered species list .
With oil pushing at least 12 miles into Louisiana 's marshes and two major pelican rookeries <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> coated in crude , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the state has begun work on a chain of berms , reinforced with containment booms , that would skirt the state 's coastline .
` ` As we talk , a total of more than 65 miles of our shoreline <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has been oiled , '' Jindal said .
Jindal , who visited one of the affected pelican nesting grounds <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> , said the berms would close the door on oil still pouring from a mile - deep gusher about 50 miles out in the Gulf .
The berms would be made with sandbags ; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also is considering a broader plan that would use dredging to build sand berms across more of the barrier islands .
At least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf , though some scientists have said they believe the spill already surpasses the 11 million - gallon <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska as the worst in U.S. history .
A mile - long tube operating for <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="APPROX">about a week</TIMEX3> has siphoned off more than half a million gallons in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">the past week</TIMEX3> , but it began sucking up oil at a slower rate over <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-W20-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> .
Even at its best , the effort did not capture all the oil leaking .
The spill 's impact <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stretches across 150 miles , from Dauphin Island , Ala. to Grand Isle , La. .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-05-23">Sunday</TIMEX3> , oil reached an 1,150 - acre oyster ground leased by Belle Chasse , La. , fisherman Dave Cvitanovich .
He said cleanup crews were stringing lines of absorbent boom along the surrounding marshes , but that still left large clumps of rust - colored oil floating over his oyster beds .
Mature oysters might eventually filter out the crude and become fit for sale , but <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> 's crop of spate , or young oysters , will perish .
` ` Those will die in the oil , ''
Cvitanovich said .
` ` It 's inevitable . ''
