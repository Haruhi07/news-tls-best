WASHINGTON --
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> , Sen. Gaylord Nelson was so moved after seeing the devastation of an oil spill off the California coast near Santa Barbara that he called for a national teach - in on the environment .
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1970">The following year</TIMEX3> the resulting '' Earth Day '' kick - started the modern environmental movement and shaped the way Americans thought about their air , water and soil .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010">Forty years later</TIMEX3> , the magnitude of the Gulf oil spill far exceeds Santa Barbara 's spill of up to 100,000 barrels , but there has n't been a comparable societal transformation .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">Last week</TIMEX3> , legislation imploded in the Senate to reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming , derailing environmentalists ' top goal , and no national consensus has emerged to move America off oil and other fossil fuels into clean energy .
Even a new more modest Senate bill , aimed at boosting energy efficiency and preventing oil spills , faces an uncertain future .
Nelson , a Wisconsin Democrat who had long championed the environment , laid out the idea of a teach - in during a speech in Seattle .
He wrote the speech on napkins while flying there , recalls his daughter , Tia Nelson .
The senator 's call inspired the first Earth Day , with millions participating across the country , including 2,000 college campuses and 10,000 elementary and high schools .
Congress adjourned so lawmakers could give speeches .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1970">1970</TIMEX3> , President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act into law .
Worries about air pollution , the dangers of DDT and polluted rivers from industrial wastes played a part .
But the Santa Barbara spill was the catalyst .
It ` ` triggered a social movement and helped to create a new politics , the politics of ecology , '' mystery novelist Ross Macdonald once wrote .
In contrast , President Barack Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06">last month</TIMEX3> used an Oval Office speech to push for clean energy , but Republicans accused him of trying exploit the Gulf tragedy for political gain .
The president took it from both sides , as some liberal commentators faulted him for failing to specifically back a cap on carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming .
The Gulf spill is estimated between 94 million and 184 million gallons , far worse than Santa Barbara 's total .

But the 10 - day spill from a well blowout six miles offshore covered miles of California 's sandy beaches with a thick , oily sludge .
Pictures of dead seals , dolphins and thousands of birds captured the nation 's attention .
` ` Santa Barbara 's psychological effect was huge , and it really got into the American mind in ways that clean air and clean water and other things had a hard time doing because they were n't personified , '' says Oliver A. Houck , who teaches environmental law at Tulane University in New Orleans .
` ` So why has n't BP yet had the same transformative effect ?
When Santa Barbara came along it was a big deal .
When BP comes along , there are so many big deals that it has a hard time competing for attention .
That said , I think it 's got an enormous national play . ''
The Santa Barbara spill featured its own version of Tony Hayward , the former chief executive of BP who angered people early on with comments such as ` ` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean , '' playing down the potential environmental impact .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1969-02">February 1969</TIMEX3> , Fred Hartley , the Canadian - born head of Union Oil Co. , which owned the Santa Barbara well , told a Senate hearing in Washington : ` ` I am always tremendously impressed at the publicity that the death of birds receives vs. the loss of people in our country in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="XXXX-XX-XX">this day</TIMEX3> and age . ''
Noting there had been no loss of human lives from the Santa Barbara well blowout , Hartley added , ` ` Relative to the number of deaths that have occurred in this fair city due to crime ...
it does seem that we should give this thing a little perspective . ''
Hartley rejected calls to halt offshore drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel , citing arguments similar to those employed by opponents of the Obama administration 's moratorium .
Hartley said he told Ronald Reagan , California 's governor then , that it would be like ` ` making a decision to shut down the whole university educational system because there is a riot in San Francisco . ''
Lois Capps , <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a Democratic congresswoman representing Santa Barbara , was a young stay - at - home mother in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> who would often take her two children to the beaches there .
` ` It shaped my views along with everyone in the region , '' she says .
` ` It was such a devastating event .
The spill was much closer to the shore , so we felt its impact sooner and more directly than this long , drawn - out affair we 're having in the Gulf . ''
Capps says there has been a strong reaction in Congress to the BP Gulf spill , with dozens of hearings and several pieces of legislation making their way through the House and Senate .
But it 's too early to draw conclusions about a societal shift , she says .
` ` It does n't happen overnight , '' Capps says .
` ` I think these things build like a tidal wave . ''
Gaylord Nelson 's speech calling for a teach - in came <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P8M">eight months</TIMEX3> after the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="1969-01">January 1969</TIMEX3> spill , and the resulting Earth Day did n't take place until <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1970" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year later</TIMEX3> -- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1970-04">April 1970</TIMEX3> .
And it was not until <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1981">1981</TIMEX3> that Congress imposed a ban on offshore drilling along most of the nation 's coastal waters , an action widely attributed to the memories of the Santa Barbara spill a dozen years earlier .
The moratorium endured for a quarter century , until Congress lifted it in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
` ` I think we 're going to see a really significant response to what happened in the Gulf played out over time , '' says Sarah Chasis , ocean initiative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
` ` I think it 's going to affect people 's consciousness , thinking , the way they approach issues for a long time . ''
There are signs this is starting to happen .
An Associated Press poll <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-06">last month</TIMEX3> found that 72 percent of Americans rated the environment as extremely important or very important -- up from 64 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> and 59 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> .
Actor Ted Danson , a board member for the international ocean conservation group Oceana , says the focus has until <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been stopping the leak .
` ` I am hopeful .
I think the time will come , '' Danson says .
` ` Oil is a very , very powerful lobby .
And the basic feeling out in the world , and I think mostly created by people whose interests are in oil , is that alternative energy is a very sweet , kind , loving thought , but certainly its day has not come .
We need oil . ''
James ` ` Bud '' Bottoms , a Santa Barbara resident who co - founded ` ` Get Oil Out '' in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> , says the Gulf spill reminded him of those days .
` ` The same thing happened here , '' says Bottoms , <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> 82 .
` ` We stood there on our banks and saw our harbors and beaches black , about two or three inches of thick goo .
We stood here and cried along our beach .
We thought our lives were over here in Santa Barbara . ''
Bottoms penned a children 's book in <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> called ` ` Davey and the GOM , '' which was n't published until <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
` ` GOM '' stands for ` ` Giant Oil Monster . ''
It 's also the acronym the offshore drilling industry and government regulators use for something else : The Gulf of Mexico .
