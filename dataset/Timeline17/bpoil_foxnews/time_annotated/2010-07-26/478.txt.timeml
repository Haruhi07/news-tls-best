<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">June 16 , 2010</TIMEX3> :
BP CEO Tony Hayward and Managing Director Bob Dudley , in background , are seen leaving the White House after meeting with President Obama .
Reuters BP 's embattled boss Tony Hayward is set to be replaced amid ` ` leadership changes '' at the firm , Fox News confirmed on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Hayward , under heavy fire for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster that followed the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , is set to step down <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> .
BP 's managing director Bob Dudley will step in as the new CEO , The Wall Street Journal reported .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-07-25" mod="START">Earlier Sunday</TIMEX3> , BP spokesman Toby Odone seemed to downplay media speculation about Hayward 's departure , saying he ` ` remains BP 's chief executive , and he has the confidence of the board and senior management .
` ` BP 's board would have to approve a change in company leadership .
An official announcement could come as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> .
BP is due to release its <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">second quarter</TIMEX3> results on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , and the board of directors is scheduled to meet before the earnings announcement .
It 's been <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three months</TIMEX3> since an offshore drilling rig operated by BP exploded off Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers and setting off the spill .
A temporary plug has stopped oil from gushing for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a week</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , but before that the busted well had spewed anywhere from 94 million gallons to 184 million gallons into the Gulf .
Crews trying to plug the leaky well for good had to stop work <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-W29" mod="END">late last week</TIMEX3> because of the threat from Tropical Storm Bonnie , but the effort was back on track as skies cleared <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-07-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
A drill rig is expected to reconnect at around midnight to the relief tunnel that will be used to pump in mud and cement to seal the well , and drilling could resume in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> .
Since the explosion , Hayward has made several highly publicized gaffes .
Among them : going to a yacht race while oil washed up on Gulf shores , and uttering the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - infamous : ` ` I want my life back '' line .
Oppenheimer & Co. senior analyst Fadel Gheit said in an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-07-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> that it was too bad Hayward 's career was derailed by the spill , but ` ` unfortunately he became a sacrificial lamb in a politically charged world . ''
Dudley would be well - suited to take over , Gheit said , describing him as even - tempered and a good delegator .
It 's never an easy time to instill new leadership in a company , though , he noted .
` ` I ' m not sure if removing Tony Hayward is going to throw BP 's problems away , '' Gheit said .
The company has already spent roughly $ 4 billion on its response to the crisis .
The final tally could be in the tens of billions of dollars .
News that the CEO will depart came as no surprise to people living along the Gulf .
Patrick Shay , 43 , sat on a porch swing of his cottage in Grand Isle , Louisiana , on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-07-25">Sunday</TIMEX3> , his front yard filled with small , white crosses , each bearing the name of sealife or ways of life the oil spill has killed .
` ` He seems like a pretty self - absorbed person , so
I ' m not surprised to hear he would walk away in the middle of all this , '' he said .
` ` If anything it will help .
They need to get him out of the way and get this cleaned up . ''
In New Orleans , Chris Hearn , a 23 - year - old security guard , said what 's important is getting the oil stopped permanently .
` ` It does n't matter who 's in charge , '' he said .
` ` As long as they clean it up , I really could care less .
They just need to get it cleaned up because it 's affecting all of us down here . ''
Completion of the relief well that is the best chance to permanently stop the oil <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> looks possible by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , but retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the spill , said he would n't hesitate to order another evacuation based on forecasts similar to the ones for Bonnie .
` ` We have no choice but to start well ahead of time if we think the storm track is going to bring gale force winds , which are 39 mph or above , anywhere close to well site , '' Allen said .
Allen said officials will spend <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">the next day</TIMEX3> determining how Bonnie , which did no real damage on shore , affected the area .
Oil may have migrated north to Mississippi Sound , he said , and officials are checking to see if boom that was protecting sensitive marshlands was pushed ashore .
Allen said he had not heard whether Hayward is being replaced .
` ` I ' ve got no knowledge of the inner workings of BP , '' he said .
Dudley took over from Hayward as BP 's point man on the cleanup in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> .
Dudley grew up partly in Hattiesburg , Mississippi .
He spent <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> at Amoco Corp. , which merged with BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , and lost out to Hayward on the CEO 's slot <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2007">three years ago</TIMEX3> .
Hayward , 53 , joined BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> as a geologist , and <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> makes $ 1.6 million <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> as the company 's head , according to their annual report .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , he received a performance bonus of more than $ 3 million plus other remuneration .
The company can terminate the contracts of directors ` ` at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">one year</TIMEX3> 's salary , '' the report says .
Hayward has a pension pot of about $ 17.3 million , which would pay 584,000 pounds <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> upon retirement .
Hayward took over the top spot at BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> after a series of events including a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery and an oil spill off the Alaska coast , as well as accusations of misusing company resources , led to the ouster of John Browne .
Upon replacing Browne , Hayward promised to focus ` ` like a laser '' on safety .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , members of Congress repeatedly reminded Hayward how empty that promise sounded with 11 workers dead , BP seemingly unprepared to contain the spill and a Congressional investigation indicating that officials put cost - savings ahead of safety in the days and hours before the rig explosion .
BP has n't completed its own investigation into the cause .
