<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3> : BP CEO Tony Hayward speaks during recovery operations at the Deepwater Horizon oil spill site in the Gulf .
AP BP appears to have had enough of its embattled CEO , and are sending him to the Russian front -- literally .
The oil giant 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , will step down from BP 's top post in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> and take a job with TNK - BP , the company 's joint venture in Russia , Sky News reported <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Hayward , who became the face of BP 's flailing efforts to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and clean up millions in damages , will likely be replaced by BP managing director Robert Dudley .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26" mod="START">earlier Monday</TIMEX3> that ` ` no final decision '' had been made about management changes , which reportedly include the departure of Hayward as chief executive in an effort to mend the company 's image after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
The oil company said its board would meet <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-07-26TEV">Monday evening</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> before it announces earnings for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-Q2">the second quarter</TIMEX3> .
The BP board would have to approve a change in company leadership .
` ` BP notes the press speculation over <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W29-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> regarding potential changes to management and the charge for the costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
BP confirms that no final decision has been made on these matters , '' the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange .
The Obama administration has called on the company to meet its clean - up obligations , despite changes in management .
` ` BP can not , should not and will not leave the Gulf without meeting its responsibilities to plug the well , to clean up the damage that 's been caused and to compensate those that have been damaged .
I think that is the most important lesson out of here , '' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters .
` ` Regardless of who leads the company , those obligations and responsibilities must be met , '' he said .
Hayward , 53 , had become a lightning rod for outrage in the United States about the spill , which started on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> with an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
Eleven workers died in the disaster .
Hayward 's comment that he was eager to resolve the incident ` ` so that I can have my life back '' antagonized his critics in the United States .
Dudley , <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> heading the effort to clean up the Gulf Coast , figured prominently in speculation about Hayward 's likely successor .
Dudley is <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> BP 's managing director , and grew up partly in Hattiesburg , Mississippi .
He spent <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> at Amoco Corp. , which merged with BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , and lost out to Hayward on the CEO 's slot <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2007">three years ago</TIMEX3> .
He took over from Hayward as the point man on the cleanup in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">Last week</TIMEX3> , BP said the cost of dealing with the spill had reached nearly $ 4 billion , but that it was too early to quantify the eventual total cost .
Hayward joined BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1982">1982</TIMEX3> as a geologist , and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> makes 1.045 million pounds -LRB-
US$ 1.6 million -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> as the company 's head , according to its annual report .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> , he received a performance bonus of more than 2 million pounds plus other remuneration , bringing his total pay package to more than 4 million pounds .
BP is in the process of selling assets to raise $ 10 billion toward a $ 20 billion fund that will finance the cleanup of the mess in the Gulf .
BP announced <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">last week</TIMEX3> that it had sold properties in the United States , Canada and Egypt to Apache Corp. for $ 7 billion .
Under pressure from President Obama , BP also has announced that it will pay no more dividends to shareholders <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
