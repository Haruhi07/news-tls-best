Secretary of Energy Steven Chu -LRB-
AP -RRB- .
As the Obama administration pursues a new moratorium on offshore drilling in reaction to the BP oil spill , a video circulating on YouTube shows it was n't too long ago that a future administration official looked to BP to ` ` save the world . ''
Energy Secretary Steven Chu , who was working at UC Berkeley at the time , says in the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> video , ` ` There 's been a lot of excitement that 's been growing <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last several years</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with partnering with BP we will have the resources to actually carry out some of the things we want to do in order to help save the world . ''
Skip forward to <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June 2010</TIMEX3> .
Following the largest oil spill in U.S. history , President Obama implemented a six - month moratorium on deepwater drilling , claiming that a presidential commission needs time to study offshore safety operations after the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2011-04-22">April 22</TIMEX3> explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
The administration , however , hit a roadblock <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> when New Orleans federal judge Martin Feldman struck down the six - month ban on drilling , arguing that the rationale for the moratorium does n't factor in the safety records of other drilling locations in the Gulf .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate subcommittee <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the moratorium needs to stay in place until it 's known whether the deepwater drilling can be done safely .
He pledged to issue a new moratorium in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> that will eliminate any doubt that it 's needed and appropriate .
The Justice Department announced <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="TIME" value="2010-06-23TEV">Wednesday evening</TIMEX3> that it will appeal the ruling , saying that a second deepwater blowout could overwhelm the efforts to respond to the BP disaster , which left 11 workers dead and unleashed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf .
Two disaster response workers were killed <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> during clean - up efforts .
In cementing its case for a moratorium , the White House has said BP and other oil companies can no longer be trusted in assuring the safety of offshore drilling .
Chu , a Nobel - prize winning physicist , worked as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley before being picked by Obama to serve as energy secretary .
BP pledged a reported $ 500 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2007-02">February 2007</TIMEX3> to help establish the Energy Biosciences Institute , an innovative biofuel program that Chu launched while working at UC Berkeley .
Touted as the world 's largest public and private consortium that researches all aspects of bioenergy , the institute 's partners include BP , the University of California , Berkeley , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
The institute focuses in particular on alternative transportation fuels .
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> video that re - emerged <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">this week</TIMEX3> , is seen telling UC Berkeley chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau , ` ` We 're going to save the world in part by doing something about the energy problem .
And this impacts national security , this impacts economic prosperity , and , and most important for me , this impacts stewardship of the environment . ''
Chu 's office told FoxNews.com <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that the energy chief helped convince BP to fund the innovative biofuel program , aimed at developing technologies to produce fuel from biomass instead of oil .
` ` As anyone can tell from watching the video , Dr. Chu was talking in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> about the potential of the Energy Biosciences Institute to achieve breakthroughs that may play an important role in reducing our dependence on oil and in solving our global energy and climate challenges , '' Chu 's press secretary Stephanie Mueller said in an e - mail <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` He has , of course , not been involved with that program since joining the -LRB- Interior -RRB- department , '' added Mueller .
BP 's multimillion - dollar partnership with the institute shows the oil giant went to great lengths in its efforts to become ` ` greener , '' an irony in the oil disaster saga that is <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> reaching into its fourth month .
The institute to date has launched 68 programs in five research areas : feedstock development , biomass depolymerization , biofuels production , enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and the socio - economic impacts of cellulosic biofuels development .
More than 300 researchers are working to develop affordable and renewable sources of energy .

And the program has produced a 320 - acre energy farm that works as a ` ` living laboratory '' for developing promising biofuel feedstocks and studying greenhouse gas emissions .
