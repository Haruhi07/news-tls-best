Martin As much as 1 million times the normal level of methane gas has been found in some regions near the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , enough to potentially deplete oxygen and create a dead zone , U.S. scientists said on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Texas A&M University oceanography professor John Kessler , just back from a 10 - day research expedition near the BP Plc oil spill in the gulf , says methane gas levels in some areas are ` ` astonishingly high . ''
Kessler 's crew took measurements of both surface and deep water within a 5 - mile radius of BP 's broken wellhead .
` ` There is an incredible amount of methane in there , '' Kessler told reporters in a telephone briefing .
In some areas , the crew of 12 scientists found concentrations that were 100,000 times higher than normal .
` ` We saw them approach a million times above background concentrations '' in some areas , Kessler said .
The scientists were looking for signs that the methane gas had depleted levels of oxygen dissolved in the water needed to sustain marine life .
` ` At some locations , we saw depletions of up to 30 percent of oxygen based on its natural concentration in the waters .
At other places , we saw no depletion of oxygen in the waters .
We need to determine why that is , '' he told the briefing .
Methane occurs naturally in sea water , but high concentrations can encourage the growth of microbes that gobble up oxygen needed by marine life .
Kessler said oxygen depletions have not reached a critical level yet , but the oil is still spilling into the Gulf , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> at a rate of as much as 60,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , according to U.S. government estimates .
` ` What is it going to look like <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two months</TIMEX3> down the road , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> down the road , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">two years</TIMEX3> down the road ? ''
Methane , a natural gas , dissolves in seawater and some scientists think measuring methane could give a more accurate picture of the extent of the oil spill .
Kessler said his team has taken those measurements , and is hoping to have an estimate soon .
` ` Give us <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="APPROX">about a week</TIMEX3> and we should have some preliminary numbers on that , '' he said .
