AFP\/Getty Images ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- A 100 - ton concrete - and - steel contraption designed to siphon off the oil fouling the Gulf of Mexico was being hauled to the spot in the sea where a blown - out well is spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of petroleum <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Engineers hope it will be the best short - term solution to controlling the leak that has only worsened since it began <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
A boat hauling the specially built containment box and dome structure pushed off <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-05-05TEV">Wednesday evening</TIMEX3> from the Louisiana coast and was expected to arrive at the site of the disaster sometime <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The Joe Griffin will meet up with another BP - chartered boat , the Boa Sub C , a Norwegian vessel that will use a crane to lower the contraption to the seafloor to cover the gusher of oil spewing from the seabed -- something that has never been tried before at such depths .
BP spokesman Bill Salvin said the drop is expected at about noon on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The dome - like top of the structure is designed to act like a funnel and siphon the oil up through 5,000 feet of pipe and onto a tanker at the surface .
Oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of at least 200,000 gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> since an offshore drilling rig exploded and sank <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last month</TIMEX3> , killing 11 people .
` ` We 're a little anxious .
They 're gon na try everything they can .
If it do n't work , they 'll try something else , '' Capt .
Demi Shaffer told The Associated Press aboard his boat just after it set off .
The AP is the only news organization with access to the containment effort .
A 12 - man crew aboard a supply boat was carrying the precious cargo .
The 280 - foot Joe Griffin , owned by Edison Chouest Offshore , also was involved in helping fight the fire that resulted from the oil rig explosion .
The vessel is named for a boat captain who worked with company founder Edison Chouest , when Chouest was still in the shrimping business .
The operator of the oil rig , BP PLC , has tried several high - tech undersea tactics to cap the leak .
The containment dome endeavor is unprecedented and engineers are fully aware of the risks .
First , crews need to properly position the four - story structure above the well as it sinks deep into the mud at the bottom of the Gulf with the help of a remote - controlled robotic submarine .
A steel pipe will be attached to a tanker at the surface and connected to the top of the dome to move the oil .
` ` It 's very dark down there ... and we will have lights on the -LRB- submersibles -RRB- , and we know exactly where to put this and guide it into place , '' said David Clarkson , BP 's vice president for project execution .
That process presents several challenges because of the frigid water temperature -- about 42 degrees Fahrenheit -- and exceptionally high pressure at those depths .
Those conditions could cause the pipe to clog with what are known in the drilling industry as ` ` ice plugs . ''
To combat that problem , crews plan to continuously pump warm water and methanol down the pipe to dissolve the clogging .
They are also worried about volatile cocktail of oil , gas and water when it arrives on the ship above .
Engineers believe the liquids can be safely separated without an explosion .
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry tried to moderate expectations that the containment box would be a silver bullet .
` ` I know we are all hoping that this containment system will work , but I want to remind everybody that this containment system is a first of its kind deployed in 5,000 feet of water , '' Landry said .
Asked to handicap the odds of success , Bob Fryer , a senior executive vice president for BP 's Deep Water Angola , offered up this assessment : ` ` This has never been done before .
Typically you would put odds on something that has been done before . ''
Fryer also said BP is exploring a technique in which crews would reconfigure the well that would allow them to plug the leak , but that effort is a couple weeks off .
The containment effort comes as dozens of boats were deployed across the Gulf to fight back the slick at the surface , including setting fires to burn off oil and laying booms to soak up the crude and block it from reaching the coast .
While people anxiously wait for the mess to wash up along the coast , globules of oil are already falling to the bottom of the sea , where they threaten virtually every link in the ocean food chain , from plankton to fish that are on dinner tables everywhere .
Hail - size gobs of oil with the consistency of tar or asphalt will roll around the bottom , while other bits will get trapped hundreds of feet below the surface and move with the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> , said Robert S. Carney , a Louisiana State University oceanographer .
` ` The threat to the deep - sea habitat is already a done deal -- it is happening <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' said Paul Montagna , a marine scientist at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University - <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Corpus Christi</TIMEX3> .
Scientists say bacteria , plankton and other tiny , bottom - feeding creatures will consume oil , and will then be eaten by small fish , crabs and shrimp .
They , in turn , will be eaten by bigger fish , such as red snapper , and marine mammals like dolphins .
The petroleum substances that concentrate in the sea creatures could kill them or render them unsafe for eating , scientists say .
` ` If the oil settles on the bottom , it will kill the smaller organisms like the copepods and small worms , '' Montagna said .
` ` When we lose the forage , then you have an impact on the larger fish . ''
Making matters worse for the deep sea is the leaking well 's location : It is near the continental shelf of the Gulf where a string of coral reefs flourishes .
Coral is a living creature that excretes a hard calcium carbonate exoskeleton , and oil globs can kill it .
Scientists are watching carefully to see whether the slick will hitch a ride to the East Coast by way of a powerful eddy known as the ` ` loop <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> , '' which could send the spill around Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean .
If that happens , the oil could foul beaches and kill marine life on the East Coast .
The cause of the rig explosion is still not known , but investigators from multiple federal agencies are looking into the matter .
The rig owner , Transocean Ltd. , said in a filing with regulators <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-05-05">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that it has received a request from the Justice Department to preserve information about the blast .
