<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">June 15</TIMEX3> : Oil company executives , -LRB- L - R -RRB- ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson , Chevron Chairman and CEO John Watson , ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO James Mulva , Shell Oil Company President Marvin Odum and BP America Inc President and Chairman Lamar McKay testify on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico during a House Energy and Commerce hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- .
Oil company executives , in an attempt to distance themselves from the crisis in the Gulf , put the blame on BP for the worst oil spill in U.S. history during a key congressional hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
House members used <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to chastise oil companies , accusing them of being no better prepared than BP to avert an environmental catastrophe .
With top oil company executives waiting to testify , Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif .
, asserted that their companies ' spill response plans amounted to ` ` paper exercises '' that mirrored BP 's failed plan .
Their strategies to plug a spill deep beneath the sea are the same failed strategies that have stymied BP , Waxman said .
The other companies ` ` are no better prepared to deal with a major oil spill than was BP , '' said Waxman , setting the tone for a tense hearing .
But oil company executives were quick to distance themselves from BP .
Chevron chief executive John Watson said Chevron 's deep - water drilling activities ` ` are safe and environmentally sound , '' but he said the company welcomes any new standards and ` ` we must learn from this accident . ''
ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson told the committee that the Gulf spill would not have occurred if BP had properly designed its deep - water well .
` ` We do not proceed with operations if we can not do so safely , '' said Tillerson .
Shell president Marvin Odum insisted , ` ` Safety and environmental protection shall and will be Shell 's top priorities . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> , Waxman 's committee released documents that showed BP made a series of money - saving shortcuts and blunders that dramatically increased the danger of a destructive spill from a well that an engineer ominously described as a ` ` nightmare '' just <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six days</TIMEX3> before the <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> blowout .
Investigators found that BP was badly behind schedule on the project and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars with each passing day , and responded by cutting corners in the well design , cementing and drilling efforts and the installation of key safety devices .
` ` Time after time , it appears that BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense .
If this is what happened , BP 's carelessness and complacency have inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants , and the workers on the rig , '' Waxman and Rep. Bart Stupak , a Democrat and chairman of the committee 's investigations panel , wrote in a letter .
One lawmaker after another expressed frustration at BP 's inability to stop oil gushing from its stricken well as the chief executives representing ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell -- as well as BPAmerica -- sat shoulder to shoulder at the witness table .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> it was speeding up payments for large commercial claims .
The company said in a statement that it has approved initial payments toward 90 percent of large commercial claims filed as a result of financial losses in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill .
BP said it approved 337 payments totaling $ 16 million to businesses that have filed claims larger than $ 5,000 apiece .
Initial payments began over <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-W23-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> and will be completed <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">this week</TIMEX3> , the company said .
The Obama administration has pressured BP to speed up payments of claims in the wake of the Gulf oil spill .
Meanwhile , Republicans used the hearing to accuse the White House of ` ` exploiting '' the Gulf oil spill crisis in order to pass a Democratic - backed energy and climate bill that 's stalled in the Senate .
` ` The president is trying to exploit this disaster to pass his national energy tax , '' Rep. Steve Scalise , R - La .
, told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , as well as the nation 's top oil executives , who gathered <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> on Capitol Hill .
` ` Stop exploiting this disaster to pass this cap and trade tax , '' Scalise said .
` ` Cap and trade '' is a phrase used mostly by Republicans to refer to a climate measure the House approved <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> .
The legislation would ` ` cap '' the amount of pollutants firms could emit .
But firms could pollute more by trading for ` ` credits '' with other polluters , and many Republicans have decried the policy as a ` ` national energy tax . ''
President Obama is expected to ask Congress to approve climate legislation when he speaks to the nation in his first Oval Office address <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-15TNI">Tuesday night</TIMEX3> following a two - day trip to the Gulf of Mexico .
` ` To exploit this crisis to resurrect his climate change legislation is just wrong , '' added House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence , R - Ind .
` ` People expect the administration not to use this incident to advance their liberal agenda . ''
A few Republicans joined Democrats to pass the climate bill in the House <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15TNI">a year ago</TIMEX3> .
But the legislation is stymied in the Senate .
Many moderate Democrats fear the bill could hurt jobs in the energy sector and along in the Gulf Coast .
The House hearing marked the first time that the chief executives of the major oil companies -- all leaders in deep - water drilling in the Gulf -- were called before Congress since the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> BP explosion on the Deepwater Horizon .
The accident killed 11 workers and unleashed the nation 's worst oil spill .
The government has estimated that as much as 2 million gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> may be flowing into the Gulf .
Waxman 's committee is expected to question BPAmerica chairman Lamar McKay on internal company e - mails and documents that the lawmaker said showed that BP made repeated decisions in the days and hours before the explosion that increased the risk of a major well blowout .
