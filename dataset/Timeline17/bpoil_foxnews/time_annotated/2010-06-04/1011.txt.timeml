Arriving on the Gulf Coast for the third time to assess the BP oil spill damage , President Obama is grappling with a public cry to get ` ` fired up '' about the catastrophe buffeting the region 's economy , environment and spirit .
Calls from his supporters to show ` ` he gets it '' have only grown since the president visited the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">last week</TIMEX3> amid complaints he was n't focused on the leak .
Obama , who landed in Louisiana <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME" value="2010-06-04TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> and headed immediately into a briefing , says he 's made the spill his top priority , but in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> the White House has tried to show the president is as angry about the mess as he is determined to solve it .
` ` I am furious at this entire situation , because this is an example of where somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions , '' Obama said in an interview <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Asked whether BP was feeling the anger , he said : ` ` They have felt the anger . ''
The president , in a sudden move , canceled plans to travel to Indonesia and Australia later in the month -- a trip that was already canceled earlier in the year because Obama wanted to concentrate on the health care debate in Congress .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the president was ` ` enraged '' about how long it 's taken for BP to plug the leak .
At the same time , the White House is pushing back on the notion that the president should be jumping up and down about the spill .
` ` I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people .
But that 's not the job I was hired to do .
My job is to solve this problem , '' Obama said in a televised interview <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-06-03TNI">Thursday night</TIMEX3> .
` ` Pounding on a podium is n't going to fix a hole in the ocean , '' Gibbs said <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I think what the American people and the citizens of the Gulf are expecting are results .

And I think that 's what the president will be measured by .
I 'll leave emotional psychiatry to others . ''
The president 's tone has been ripe for criticism even among his supporters .
Democratic strategist James Carville demanded that Obama ` ` get down here , '' and film director Spike Lee urged the ` ` calm '' and ` ` cool '' president to , ` ` one time , go off ! ''
Jon Stewart , on '' The Daily Show , '' ridiculed the president for trying to balance the ceremonial duties of the president -- like attendance at cultural heritage events -- with management of the spill .
New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that Obama has ` ` willfully and inexplicably resisted fulfilling a signal part of his job : being a prism in moments of fear and pride , reflecting what Americans feel so they know he gets it . ''
Images of oil - soaked waterfowl were shown in heavy rotation in the media on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">Thursday</TIMEX3> , giving a glimpse into the potential damage the slick may cause to the coastline .
Local officials have expressed grave concern about the harm the spill can do to tourism .
` ` It 's just heartbreaking , '' Sen. David Vitter , R - La .
, told Fox News on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> about the images of wildlife .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> it has started to capture and siphon some of the leaking oil after jamming a cap onto the well .
The long - term solution -- drilling relief wells -- is not expected to be completed until <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> at the earliest .
Eleven workers were killed in the <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> oil rig explosion that triggered the leak .
