<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">May 1</TIMEX3> : Birds fly past oil booms that were placed in preparation of the looming oil spill from <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> 's collapse and spill of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig along the shoreline , south of Venice , La. .
VENICE , Louisiana -- BP 's chairman defended his company 's safety record and said <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> that ` ` a failed piece of equipment '' was to blame for a massive oil spill along the Gulf Coast , where President Barack Obama was headed for a firsthand update on the slick creeping toward American shores .
BP PLC chairman Lamar McKay told ABC 's ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-W17">This Week</TIMEX3> '' that he ca n't say when the well a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- beneath the sea might be plugged .
But he said he believes a dome that could be placed over the well is expected to be deployed in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P8D">eight days</TIMEX3> .
The dome has been made and workers are finishing the plan to get it deployed , McKay said .
He said BP officials are still working to activate a ` ` blowout preventer '' mechanism meant to seal off the geyser of oil .
` ` And as you can imagine , this is like doing open - heart surgery at 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- , with -- in the dark , with robot - controlled submarines , '' McKay said .
BP spokesman Bill Salvin said McKay was talking about the blowout preventer as the failed equipment that caused the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 people .
The blowout preventer typically activates after a blast or other event to cut off any oil that may spill .
The cause of the blast remains undetermined , and Salvin said ` ` we 're not ruling anything out . ''
Crews have had little success stemming the flow from the ruptured well on the sea floor off Louisiana or removing oil from the surface by skimming it , burning it or dispersing it with chemicals .

The churning slick of dense , rust - colored oil is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> roughly the size of Puerto Rico .
Adding to the gloomy outlook were warnings from experts that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> carries it toward the Atlantic .
Long tendrils of oil sheen made their way into South Pass , a major channel through the salt marshes of Louisiana 's southeastern bootheel that is a breeding ground for crab , oysters , shrimp , redfish and other seafood .
Venice charter boat captain Bob Kenney lamented that there was no boom in the water to corral the oil , and said BP was ` ` pretty much over their head in the deep water . ''
` ` If they were n't , they would have cut the oil off by <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
` ` It 's like a slow version of Katrina , '' he added .
` ` My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . ''
About a half - dozen fishing vessels sailed <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2010-05-02TMO">Sunday morning</TIMEX3> through the marshes of coastal St. Bernard Parish in eastern Louisiana , headed for the Biloxi Wildlife Management area .
The oyster and shrimp boats , laden with boom , hoped to seal off inlets , bayous and bays .
There is growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster , which cast a pall over the region 's economy and fragile environment .
Moving to blunt criticism that the Obama administration has been slow in reacting to the largest U.S. crude oil spill in decades , the White House dispatched two Cabinet members to make the rounds on the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> television talk shows .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on ` ` Fox News <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> '' that the government has taken an ` ` all hands on deck '' approach to the spill since the BP oil well ruptured .
Napolitano said that as BP officials realized more oil was spewing than first thought , the government has coordinated federal , state and local resources with the oil company 's response .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told NBC 's ` ` Meet the Press '' that it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> before workers attain what he calls the ` ` ultimate solution '' to stopping the leak -- drilling a relief well more than 3 miles -LRB- 5 kilometers -RRB- below the ocean floor .
However , as the spill surged toward disastrous proportions , critical questions lingered : Who created the conditions that caused the gusher ?
Did BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days ?

And , most important , how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse ?
The Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated the well was spewing at least 200,000 gallons -LRB- 757,000 liters -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
Even at that rate , the spill should eclipse the <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks .
But a growing number of experts warned that the situation may already be much worse .
The oil slick over the water 's surface appeared to triple in size <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P2D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past two days</TIMEX3> , which could indicate an increase in the rate oil is pouring from the well , according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami .
While it 's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth , images do indicate growth , experts said .
` ` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , '' said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing .
In an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2009-02">February 2009</TIMEX3> , BP said it had the capability to handle a ` ` worst - case scenario '' at the site , which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout -- 6.8 million gallons -LRB- 26 million liters -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
Oil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what , exactly , a worst - case scenario would look like .

But if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and carries it to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially loops around the state 's southern tip and up the eastern seaboard -- several experts said it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions .
` ` It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time , '' Graber said .
` ` I do n't think we can prevent that .
It 's more of a question of when rather than if . ''
The concerns are both environmental and economic .
The fishing industry is worried marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway .
Tourism officials are worried vacationers wo n't want to visit oil - tainted beaches .
And environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds , coral and mammals in and near the Gulf .
` ` We know they are out there , '' said Meghan Calhoun , a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans .
` ` Unfortunately , the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us . ''
Fishermen and boaters want to help but have been hampered by high winds and rough waves that render oil - catching booms largely ineffective .
Some coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP was hampering mitigation efforts .
` ` No , I ' m not happy with the protection , but I ' m sure the oil company is saving money , '' said 57 - year - old Raymond Schmitt , in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour .
And the oil on the surface is just part of the problem .
Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well .
If that happens , there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating .
` ` When these things go , they go KABOOM , '' he said .
` ` If this thing does collapse , we ' ve got a big , big blow . ''
BP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping .
A company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels .
Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster .
As if to cut off mounting criticism , on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> White House spokesman Robert Gibbs posted a blog entitled ` ` The Response to the Oil Spill , '' laying out the administration 's day - by - day response since the explosion , using words like ` ` immediately '' and ` ` quickly , '' and emphasizing that Obama ` ` early on '' directed responding agencies to devote every resource to the incident and determining its cause .
