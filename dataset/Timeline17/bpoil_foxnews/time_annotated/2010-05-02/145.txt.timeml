<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">May 2</TIMEX3> : Water from the Gulf of Mexico washes ashore on an island near the South Pass of the Mississippi River near Venice , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- .
VENICE , Louisiana -- Federal officials shut down fishing from the Mississippi River to the Florida Panhandle on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> because of the uncontrolled gusher spewing massive amounts of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , and the environmental disaster is still expected to take <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least a week</TIMEX3> to cut off .
Even that toxic scenario may be too rosy because it depends on a low - tech strategy that has never been attempted before in deep water .
The plan : to lower 74 - ton , concrete - and - metal boxes into the gulf to capture the oil and siphon it to a barge waiting at the surface .
Whether that will work for a leak 5,000 feet below the surface is anyone 's guess ; the method has previously worked only in shallower waters .
If it does n't , and efforts to activate a shutoff mechanism called a blowout preventer continue to prove fruitless , the oil probably will keep gushing for months until a second well can be dug to cut off the first .
Oil giant BP PLC 's latest plan will take <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6D">six</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P8D">eight days</TIMEX3> because welders have to assemble the boxes .
President Barack Obama toured the region <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> , deflecting criticism that his administration was too slow to respond and did too little to stave off the catastrophe .
Satellite images indicate the rust - hued slick tripled in size in just <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> , suggesting the oil could be pouring out faster than before .
Wildlife including sea turtles have been found dead on the shore but it is too soon whether the spill , caused by an <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> oil rig explosion , was to blame .
Even if the well is shut off in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> , fishermen and wildlife officials wonder how long it will take for the gulf to recover .
Some compare it to the hurricane Louisiana is still recovering from after <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five years</TIMEX3> .
` ` It 's like a slow version of Katrina , '' Venice charter boat captain Bob Kenney said .
` ` My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . ''
More than 6,800 square miles of federal fishing areas , from the mouth of the Mississippi to Florida 's Pensacola Bay were closed for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P10D" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 10 days</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco says government scientists are taking samples from the waters near the spill to determine whether there is any danger .
Fishermen still were out working , however : They have been dropping miles of inflatable , oil - capturing boom around the region 's fragile wetlands and prime fishing areas .
Bad weather , however , was thwarting much of the work ; Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said 80 percent of the booms laid down off his state <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P3D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the previous three days</TIMEX3> had broken down .
He said boom along other coasts is breaking down also .
The Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated to be at least 200,000 gallons <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> .
At that rate , it would eclipse the <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez tanker spill -- which dumped 11 million gallons off the Alaska coast -- as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks .
` ` None of us have ever had experience at this level before .
It ai n't good , '' said Bob Love , coastal and nongame resources administrator with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries .
` ` The longer it goes , the more fish and wildlife impacts there will be . ''
Even if the oil stays mostly offshore , the consequences could be dire for sea turtles , dolphins and other deepwater marine life -- and microscopic plankton and tiny creatures that are a staple of larger animals ' diets .
Moby Solangi , director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport , Miss. , said at least 20 dead sea turtles were found on the state 's beaches .
He said it 's too soon to say whether oil contamination killed them but that it is unusual to have them turning up across such a wide stretch of coast , spanning nearly 30 miles .
None of the turtles have oil on them , but Solangi said they could have ingested oily fish or breathed in oil on the surface .
Necropsies will be performed <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-04-26">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The situation could become even more grave if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and flows to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially whips around the state 's southern tip and up the Eastern Seaboard .
Tourist - magnet beaches and countless wildlife could be ruined .
Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> he called the spill a ` ` massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' and made clear that he was not accepting blame .
` ` BP is responsible for this leak .
BP will be paying the bill , '' he said , rain dripping from his face in Venice , a Gulf Coast community serving as a staging area for the response .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said any comparison between the ruptured BP oil well and Katrina was ` ` a total mischaracterization '' and that the government has taken an ` ` all hands on deck '' approach .
Plaquemines Parish president Billy Nungesser met with Obama <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> in Venice and said the president 's ` ` let 's - get - it - done approach was overwhelming . ''
He said he hopes that the president pressures BP to approve funding for a plan to have fishermen start laying oil - sopping booms very soon .
Obama acknowledged the booms have n't been working well out in the choppy gulf , Nungesser said .
After the oil rig explosion , which killed 11 people , the flow of oil should have been stopped by a blowout preventer , but the mechanism failed , as have continuing efforts to activate it .
` ` As you can imagine , this is like doing open - heart surgery at 5,000 feet , with -- in the dark , with robot - controlled submarines , '' BP PLC Chairman Lamar McKay said on ABC 's ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-W17">This Week</TIMEX3> . ''
He defended his company 's safety record .
Charlie Holt , drilling and completing operations manager for BP in the Gulf of Mexico , said <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> it 's still unclear why the blowout preventer failed .
But he suggested something could be in the way , or it could be damaged .
` ` There is nothing unique about the situation that should have prohibited the BOP from working as designed , '' Holt said of the device .
The containment boxes being built to stop the leak -- 40 feet tall , 24 feet wide and 14 feet deep -- were not part of the company 's original response plan .
But they appear to be the best hope for keeping the oil well from gushing for months .
The approach has been used previously only for spills in relatively shallow water .
Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said engineers are still examining whether the valves and other systems that feed oil to a ship on the surface can withstand the extra pressures of the deep .
` ` This is a completely new way of dealing with this problem , '' said Greg Pollock , commissioner of the oil spill prevention and response program at the Texas General Land Office .
` ` Generally speaking , nobody 's ever tried anything like this on this scale . ''
If the boxes do n't work , BP also has begun work on its only other backup plan : two relief wells that will take as long as <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> to drill .
Bob Fryar , senior vice president for BP in Angola , said the Bureau of Minerals Management has approved a plan to drill the wells .
BP wants to drill two in case one does n't work .
He said teams are working <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> on every possible solution .
He said 389 people reported to an emergency center at BP 's Houston office alone .
` ` What BP 's doing is is throwing absolutely everything we can at this , '' he said <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We ceratainly want to do everything we can , everything we can possibly think of , as a company , as an industry . ''
BP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed the Deepwater Horizon rig was tapping when it exploded .
A company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels .
Fryar said any numbers being thrown out are just estimates at best .
The rig was operated by BP and owned by Transocean Ltd. .
Teams working to contain the spill have had limited success using airplanes to drop chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil , and rough seas have prevented ships from skimming crude from the surface .
In Alabama , National Guard soldiers arrived on the state 's Dauphin Island to build a berm meant to buffer part of the island against the slick .
