President Obama makes a statement on his small business jobs initiatives , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">Friday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">June 11 , 2010</TIMEX3> , in the Rose Garden of the White House .
-LRB- AP -RRB- President Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">Saturday</TIMEX3> reassured Prime Minister David Cameron that his frustration over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is not an attack on Britain .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">a day earlier</TIMEX3> , Obama blasted U.S. lawmakers and Tea Party activists for criticizing his response to the nation 's worst environmental disaster , suggesting they are being hypocrites .
` ` I think it 's fair to say , if <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-12">six months ago</TIMEX3> , before this spill had happened , I had gone up to Congress and I had said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and we need to spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill , there are folks up there , who will not be named , who would have said this is classic , big - government overregulation and wasteful spending , '' he told Politico in an interview .
Obama also suggested the criticism coming from anti - big government protesters , such as Tea Party activists , was hypocritical .
` ` Some of the same folks who have been hollering and saying ` do something ' are the same folks who , just <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-03">three months ago</TIMEX3> , were suggesting that government needs to stop doing so much , '' Obama said .
` ` Some of the same people who are saying the president needs to show leadership and solve this problem are some of the same folks , who just <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few months ago</TIMEX3> , were saying this guy is trying to engineer a takeover of our society through the federal government that is going to restrict our freedoms . ''
But Obama sang a much different tune to Cameron on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">Saturday</TIMEX3> when the two leaders held a ` ` warm and constructive '' telephone conversation for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PT30M" mod="MORE_THAN">more than 30 minutes</TIMEX3> , Cameron 's Downing St. office said .
Cameron 's office said the prime minister ` ` expressed his sadness at the ongoing human and environmental catastrophe , '' but stressed BP 's economic important to Britain , the U.S. and other countries .
Then Obama told the prime minister ` ` that his unequivocal view was that BP was a multinational global company and that frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity .
The prime minister stressed the economic importance of BP to the U.K. , U.S. and other countries .
The president made clear that he had no interest in undermining BP 's value . ''
Cameron is under pressure to get Obama to tone down the criticism fearing it will hurt the millions of British retirees that hold BP stock .
The company 's stock has lost 40 percent of its value since the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> oil rig fire .
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif .
, fired back at Obama over his criticism of Congress , saying hypocrisy is no excuse for inaction ` ` in addressing the dysfunctional and corrupt nature of the Minerals and Management Service '' -- the agency that oversees offshore drilling .
` ` If President Obama had exercised some long overdue leadership and called on Congress to address the cozy relationship between MMS and the industry they regulate , I would have been the very first person to partner with him and give MMS the overhaul it desperately needs , '' Issa said in a written statement .
` ` After 10 inspector general reports , 10 GAO reports , a congressional investigation , the real question is , why did it take such a catastrophe for the president to call for action , '' he said .
Obama has sharpened his attacks on BP in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> as the company struggles to stop oil gushing from its ruptured deepsea well .
Obama has said he would have fired BP 's top executive , if he were in charge , and has supported the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend .
In a sign the company feels the pressure , BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">Saturday</TIMEX3> that its board would meet <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-06-14">Monday</TIMEX3> to discuss deferring its second - quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known .
BP said no decision had yet been made .
Obama also has reproached BP for spending money on a public relations campaign and occasionally refers to ` ` British Petroleum , '' although the company years ago began using only its initials and is a far - reaching international corporation with extensive holdings in the United States , including a Texas refinery and a share of the Alaska oil pipeline .
This <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">past week</TIMEX3> , the usually measured Obama said in a television interview , ` ` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar ; we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers --
so I know whose ass to kick . ''
