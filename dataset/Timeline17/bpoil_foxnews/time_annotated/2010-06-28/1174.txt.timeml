` ` Florida has 825 miles of beaches , 221 of them right here in Northwest Florida , '' says the narrator in one TV spot for Visit Florida .
` ` That 's a lot of beach to choose from .
There are plenty of places in Florida where you can enjoy crystal clear waters and a great beach vacation . ''
The VisitFlorida.com website offers real time images and information on the status of beaches .
In neighboring Alabama , Gulfshores.com provides similar updates to help tourists ` ` make an informed travel decision . ''
One TV spot promoting Gulf Shores , Alabama and neighboring Orange Beach features features Lucy Buffett , a local restaurant owner and sister of music legend Jimmy Buffett .
` ` I love my gorgeous Alabama beaches , '' Lucy Buffett says in the ad .
` ` We 're keeping a close eye on the beaches so you can enjoy them too .
So , get on down here ! ''
The Alabama campaign also touts the area 's shopping , food , golf and entertainment .
The official state and regional tourism ads largely avoid direct references to ` ` oil '' and speak only to their specific destination -- not the situation in neighboring communities .
However , Spirit Airlines raised some eyebrows with a <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> promotion for flights to Ft . .
Lauderdale , Florida , Atlantic City , New Jersey , Cancun , Mexico and San Juan , Puerto Rico .
With the banner ` ` Check Out The Oil On Our Beaches , '' the ads feature a sunbather next to a bottle of sunblock in the BP colors of yellow and green .
Although the company faces criticism for the ad 's timing and humor , Spirit Airlines officials offer no apology , just an explanation : ` ` It is unfortunate that some have misunderstood our intention with <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-28">today</TIMEX3> 's beach promotion .
We are merely addressing the false perception that we have oil on our beaches , and we are encouraging customers to support Florida and our other beach destinations by continuing to travel to these vacation hot spots . ''
FOX News covers the action from all the angles .
