{"id": "765", "time": "2010-05-15", "text": "An image from a video of a jagged pipe leaking millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , recorded by a BP camera a mile below the water 's surface . \nBP ROBERT , Louisiana -- BP was confident Saturday its latest experiment using a mile-long pipe would capture much of the oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , even as the company disclosed yet another setback in the environmental disaster . \nEngineers hit a snag when they tried to connect two pieces of equipment a mile below the water 's surface . \nBP PLC chief operating officer Doug Suttles said one piece of equipment , called the framework , had to be brought to the water 's surface so that adjustments could be made to where it fits with the long tube that connects to a tanker above . \nThe framework holds a pipe and stopper , and engineers piloting submarine robots will try to use it to plug the massive leak and send the crude through the lengthy pipe to the surface . \n`` The frame shifted , so they were unable to make that connection , '' said Suttles , who believes the adjustments will make the device work . \nAt least 210,000 gallons of oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico since an oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later . \nEleven people were killed in the blast . \nBP 's latest idea seems to have the best chance for success so far , said Ed Overton , a LSU professor of environmental studies . \nAt the surface this would be easy , Overton said , but using robots in 5,000 feet of water with oil gushing out of the pipe makes things much more difficult . \n`` It 's something like threading the eye of a needle . \nBut that can be tough to do up here . \nAnd you can imagine how hard it would be to do it down there with a robot , '' Overton said . \nThe tube could capture more than three-quarters of the leak ; BP also must contend with a smaller leak that 's farther away . \nIf the tube works , it would be the first time the company has been able to capture any of the oil before it fouls the Gulf waters . \nA week ago , the company tried to put a massive box over the leak , but icelike crystals formed and BP scrapped that plan . \nBP is also drilling a relief well that is considered the permanent solution to stopping the leak . \nIt 's about halfway done and still months away from being completed . \nThe company also is still considering using a smaller containment dome known as a `` top hat , '' as well as a `` junk shot , '' in which golf balls and rubber would be inserted to try to clog the leak . \nMeanwhile , BP began spraying undersea dispersants at that leak site and said the chemicals appear to have reduced the amount of surface oil . \nThis unprecedented use of chemical dispersants underwater , and the depth of the leak has created many unknowns regarding environmental impact , and researchers hurriedly worked to chart its effects . \nResearchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology reported this week that they had detected large oil plumes from just beneath the surface of the sea to more than 4,000 feet deep . \nResearchers Vernon Asper and Arne Dierks said in Web posts that the plumes were `` perhaps due to the deep injection of dispersants which BP has stated that they are conducting . '' \nThree or four large plumes have been found , at least one that is 10 miles long and a mile wide , said Samantha Joye , a marine science professor supporting the mission from her University of Georgia lab . \nThese researchers were also testing the effects of large amounts of subsea oil on oxygen levels in the water . \nThe oil can deplete oxygen in the water , harming plankton and other tiny creatures that serve as food for a wide variety of sea critters . \nOxygen levels in some areas have dropped 30 percent , and should continue to drop , Joye said . \n`` It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas , '' Joye said . \n`` We 've never seen anything like this before . \nIt 's impossible to fathom the impact . '' \nJoye 's lab was waiting for the research boat to return so a team of scientists can test about 75 water samples and 100 sediment samples gathered during the voyage . \nResearchers plan to go back out in about a month and sample the same areas to see if oil and oxygen levels have worsened . \nFederal regulators on Friday approved the underwater use of the chemicals , which act like a detergent to break the oil into small globules and allow it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before it comes ashore . \nThe decision by the Environmental Protection Agency angered state officials and fishermen , who complained that regulators ignored their concerns about the effects on the environment and fish . \n`` The EPA is conducting a giant experiment with our most productive fisheries by approving the use of these powerful chemicals on a massive , unprecedented scale , '' John Williams , executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said in a news release . \nLouisiana Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine sent a letter to BP outlining similar concerns , but the company and the Coast Guard said several tests were done before approval was given . \n`` We did n't cross this threshold lightly , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \n`` This is a tool that will be analyzed and monitored . '' \nAs crews worked to limit the environmental hazards , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano pressured BP to make clear whether the company would limit how much it will pay for clean up and compensation to those hurt by the spill . \nIn a letter to chief executive Tony Hayward , she noted that he and other executives have said they are taking full responsibility for cleaning up the spill and will pay what they call `` legitimate '' claims . \nNapolitano said the government believes this means BP will not limit its payments to a $ 75 million cap set by law for liability in some cases . \n`` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Napolitano wrote . \nOn Friday , President Barack Obama assailed oil drillers and his own administration as he ordered extra scrutiny of drilling permits . \nHe condemned the shifting of blame by oil executives and denounced a `` cozy relationship '' between the companies and the federal government . \n"}

Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , said that BP had informed his House committee that at some point when the well was being closed with cement , an influx of methane entered the wellhead , indicating that cementing the well had not produced needed pipe integrity . \nWaxman , opening a hearing into the April 20 well explosion that unleashed a massive oil spill , said while `` we have far more questions than answers '' it appeared clear -- from BP and other documents -- that there were problems with the blowout preventers before the accident and confusion almost right up to the time of the explosion over the success of the cementing process . \nThe committee said that there were at least `` four significant problems with the blowout preventer '' used on the Deepwater Horizon drill rig . \nRep. Bart Stupak , a Michigan Democrat , said that a 2001 report by Transocean , which made the device , indicated there can be as many as 260 failure possibilities in the equipment . \nThe device is supposed to be the final safeguard against a well blowout by clamping down and sealing a gushing oil well . \n`` How can a device that has 260 failure modes be considered fail-safe ? '' \nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee was to hear from executives of BP , Transocean Ltd , Halliburton , which conducted the cementing on the BP rig , and Cameron Inc. . \nStupak said BP confirmed in documents that a leak had been found in the hydraulic system that provides emergency power to a part of the blowout preventer . \nWhen a remote underwater vehicle tried to activate the safety device , a loss of hydraulic pressure was detected , said Stupak . \nIn the Gulf , crews lowered a new containment box to the seafloor in preparation for the latest bid to funnel the gusher to a waiting tanker . \nThe blown well has spewed at least 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of oil into the Gulf over three weeks . \n`` If this is like other catastrophic failures of technological systems in modern history , whether it was the sinking of the Titanic , Three Mile Island , or the loss of the Challenger , we will likely discover that there was a cascade of failures and technical and human and regulatory errors , '' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee . \nBP 's latest bid to stop the oil leak was a new containment box that reached the seafloor overnight after being lowered late Tuesday by a crane from the deck of the Viking Poseidon . \nThe box , dubbed a top hat , was initially set down away from the gusher while engineers work to avoid problems that scuttled an earlier effort , BP spokesman Bill Salvin said . \nThe first box sent down last week weighed 100 tons and company officials had hoped it could contain 85 percent of the oil . \nHowever , it was never tried at such depths -- about a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the surface . \nA slushy mixture of gas and water clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box and it was cast aside . \nThe latest box is much smaller -- just 2 tons . \nIt wo n't be placed over the spewing well right away because engineers want to make sure everything is configured correctly and avoid the same buildup , Salvin said . \nCrews also planned to pump in heated water and methanol so ice wo n't amass . \nCoast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said it is about 35 degrees -LRB- 1.7 Celsius -RRB- Fahrenheit at the bottom of the sea floor where the oil is spilling . \nAnd , in yet another sign the spill is getting worse , Louisiana wildlife officials said Wednesday that tar balls had washed ashore in South Pass in the state 's southeastern tip . \nThe marshy area is home to prime waters for shrimp and other seafood . \n"}

Jeff Bingaman , D-N.M. , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee . \nLater Tuesday , a crane lifted the new box from the deck of the Viking Poseidon , one of the more than a dozen boats helping the containment effort , and lowered it into the sea about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast , a process expected to last several hours or more . \nThe first box sunk last week weighed 100 tons and company officials had hoped it could contain 85 percent of the oil . \nHowever , it was never tried at such depths -- about a mile below the surface -- and in 40-degree water . \nA slushy mixture of gas and water clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box and it was cast aside . \nThe latest box is much smaller -- just 2 tons . \nIt wo n't be placed over the spewing well right away because engineers want to make sure everything is configured correctly and avoid the same buildup , BP spokesman Bill Salvin said . \nCrews also planned to pump in heated water and methanol so ice wo n't amass . \nIt could be in place by Thursday . \nLawmakers ' focus was on what failures may have led to the disaster . \nThe corporate finger pointing prompted an admonishment from Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of oil-rich Alaska that `` we are all in this together '' in trying to shut off the oil and find a safer way to exploit vital energy . \n`` This accident has reminded us of a cold reality , that the production of energy will never be without risk or environmental consequence , '' she said . \nStill , she said , `` there will be no excuse '' if operators are found to have violated the law . \n`` Let me be really clear , '' Lamar McKay , chairman of BP America , told the hearing . \n`` Liability , blame , fault -- put it over here . '' \nHe said : `` Our obligation is to deal with the spill , clean it up and make sure the impacts of that spill are compensated , and we 're going to do that . '' \nBy `` over here , '' McKay meant the witness table at which BP , Transocean and Halliburton executives sat shoulder to shoulder . \nAnd despite his acknowledgment of responsibility , each company defended its own operations and raised questions about its partners in the project gone awry . \nIn the crowded hearing room , eight young activists sat in quiet protest , with black T-shirts saying , `` Energy Should n't Cost Lives . '' \nSeveral wore black painted spots near their eyes to symbolize tear drops made from oil . \nThe spreading disaster in the Gulf intensified the political impatience all the way to the White House . \n`` The president is frustrated with everything , the president is frustrated with everybody , in the sense that we still have an oil leak , '' spokesman Robert Gibbs said . \nUncertainty over what was happening a mile underwater seemed to confuse Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who was touring the Alabama coast . \nWhile admitting it had not been verified , she said there was cause for hope that the spill was slowing down because tests indicated less oil and more natural gas was coming out . \nBut BP spokesman Mark Proegler said there has always been a mixture of gas and oil coming up and that scientists have n't noticed any significant change in the leak . \nSenators sought assurances that BP PLC will pay what could amount to billions of dollars in economic and environmental damages . \nMcKay repeatedly said his company would pay for cleanup costs and all `` legitimate '' claims for damages , and not try to limit itself to an existing federal limit of $ 75 million on such damages . \nBP was the exploratory well 's owner and overall operator , Transocean , the rig 's owner and Halliburton , a subcontractor that was encasing the well pipe in cement before plugging it in anticipation of future production . \nThe April 20 explosion is thought to have begun with a surge of methane gas from deep within the well , and while the cause is still under early investigation , testimony provided some insight into what might have been involved . \nRepublican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama grew frustrated grilling the executives on why engineers replaced a heavy `` mud '' compound in the well with much lighter sea water when they were temporarily capping the site for future exploitation . \n`` I 'm not familiar with the individual procedure on that well , '' McKay said . \nSteven Newman , Transocean 's president and CEO , and Halliburton executive Tim Probert repeatedly told Sessions they did not know how often sea water instead of the compound was used to seal Gulf wells . \n`` Well , you do this business , do you not ? '' \n`` You 're under oath . \nI 'm just asking you a simple question . '' \nNew Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg remarked in the day 's other hearing : `` The conclusion that I draw is that nobody assumes the responsibility . '' \nMcKay said that a key piece of safety equipment , the aptly named blowout preventer , had failed to work and made it clear it was owned by Transocean . \n`` That was the fail safe in case of an accident , '' said McKay . \nBut Transocean 's Newman said offshore production projects `` begin and end with the operator , in this case BP '' and that his company 's drilling job was completed three days before the explosion and there 's `` no reason to believe '' the blowout protector mechanics failed . \nHalliburton 's Probert said his company followed BP 's drilling plan , federal regulations and industry practices . \n"}

Thad Allen said . \nGovernment officials have warned that cutting away the pipe could , at least temporarily , increase the flow of oil by 20 percent . \nBP turned to the shears after a diamond-tipped saw became stuck in the pipe halfway through the job , yet another frustrating delay in six weeks of the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nThe cap will be lowered and sealed over the coming hours , Allen said . \nIt wo n't be known how much oil BP can siphon to a tanker on the surface until the cap is fitted , but the irregular cut means it wo n't fit as snug as officials had hoped . \n`` We 'll have to see when we get the containment cap on it just how effective it is , '' Allen said . \n`` It will be a test and adapt phase as we move ahead , but it 's a significant step forward . '' \nEven if it works , BP engineers expect oil to continue leaking into the ocean . \nThe next chance to stop the flow wo n't come until two relief wells meant to plug the reservoir for good are finished in August . \nThis latest attempt to control the spill , the so-called cut-and-cap method , is considered risky because slicing away a section of the 20-inch-wide riser could remove kinks in the pipe and temporarily increase the flow of oil by as much as 20 percent . \nAllen said it was unclear whether the flow had increased . \n`` I do n't think we 'll know until the containment cap is seated on there , '' he said . \n`` We 'll have to wait and see . '' \nBP 's top executive acknowledged Thursday the global oil giant was unprepared to fight a catastrophic deepwater oil spill . \nChief executive Tony Hayward told The Financial Times it was `` an entirely fair criticism '' to say the company had not been fully prepared for a deepwater oil leak . \nHayward called it `` low-probability , high-impact '' accident . \n`` What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool-kit , '' Hayward said in an interview published in Thursday 's edition of the London-based newspaper . \nOil drifted six miles from the Florida Panhandle 's popular sugar-white beaches , and crews on the mainland were doing everything possible to limit the catastrophe . \nThe Coast Guard 's Allen directed BP to pay for five additional sand barrier projects in Louisiana . \nBP said Thursday the project will cost it about $ 360 million , on top of about $ 990 million it had spent on response and clean up , grants to four Gulf coast states and claims from people and companies hurt by the spill . \nAs the edge of the slick drifted toward Pensacola 's beaches , emergency workers rushed to link the last in a miles-long chain of booms designed to fend off the oil . \nThey were slowed by thunderstorms and wind before the weather cleared in the afternoon . \nForecasters said the oil would probably wash up by Friday , threatening a delicate network of islands , bays and white-sand beaches that are a haven for wildlife and a major tourist destination dubbed the Redneck Riviera . \n`` We are doing what we can do , but we can not change what has happened , '' said John Dosh , emergency director for Escambia County , which includes Pensacola . \nThe effect on wildlife has grown , too . \nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported 522 dead birds -- at least 38 of them oiled -- along the Gulf coast states , and more than 80 oiled birds have been rescued . \nIt 's not clear exactly how many of the deaths can be attributed to the spill . \nDead birds and animals found during spills are kept as evidence in locked freezers until investigations and damage assessments are complete , according to Teri Frady , a spokeswoman for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration . \n`` This includes strict chain-of-custody procedures and long-term locked storage until the investigative and damage assessment phases of the spill are complete , '' she wrote in an e-mail . \nAs the oil drifted closer to Florida , beachgoers in Pensacola waded into the gentle waves , cast fishing lines and sunbathed , even as a two-man crew took water samples . \nOne of the men said they were hired by BP to collect samples to be analyzed for tar and other pollutants . \nA few feet away , Martha Feinstein , 65 , of Milton , Fla. , pondered the fate of the beach she has been visiting for years . \n`` You sit on the edge of your seat and you wonder where it 's going , '' she said . \n`` It 's the saddest thing .

{"id": "1920", "time": "2010-06-03", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS -LRB- AP -RRB- -- For days now , Dr. Damon Dietrich and other physicians have seen patients come through their emergency room at West Jefferson Medical Center with similar symptoms : respiratory problems , headaches and nausea . \nIn the past week , 11 workers who have been out on the water cleaning up oil from BP 's blown-out well have been treated for what Dietrich calls `` a pattern of symptoms '' that could have been caused by the burning of crude oil , noxious fumes from the oil or the dispersants dumped in the Gulf to break it up . \nAll workers were treated and released . \n`` One person comes in , it could be multiple things , '' he said . \n`` Eleven people come in with these symptoms , it makes it incredibly suspicious . '' \nFew studies have examined long-term health effects of oil exposure . \nBut some of the workers trolling Gulf Coast beaches and heading out into the marshes and waters have complained about flu-like symptoms -- a similar complaint among crews deployed for the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . \nBP and U.S. Coast Guard officials have said dehydration , heat , food poisoning or other unrelated factors may have caused the workers ' symptoms . \nThe Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is investigating . \nBrief contact with small amounts of light crude oil and dispersants are not harmful . \nSwallowing small amounts of oil can cause upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea . \nLong-term exposure to dispersants , however , can cause central nervous system problems , or do damage to blood , kidneys or livers , according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention . \nIn the six weeks since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , killing 11 workers , an estimated 21 million to 45 million gallons of crude has poured into the Gulf of Mexico . \nHundreds of BP contractors have fanned out along the Gulf , deploying boom , spraying chemicals to break up the oil , picking up oil-soaked debris and trying to keep the creeping slick out of the sensitive marshes and away from the tourist-Mecca beaches . \nCommercial fisherman John Wunstell Jr. spent a night on a vessel near the source of the spill and left complaining of a severe headache , upset stomach and nose bleed . \nHe was treated at the hospital , and sued -- becoming part of a class-action lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court in New Orleans against BP , Transocean and their insurers . \nWunstell , who was part of a crew burning oil , believes planes were spraying dispersant in the middle of the night -- something BP disputes . \n`` I began to ache all over ... '' he said in the affidavit . \n`` I was completely unable to function at this point and feared that I was seriously ill . '' \nDozens of complaints , most from spill workers , have been made related to oil exposure with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals , said spokeswoman Olivia Watkins , as well as with the Louisiana Poison Center , clinics and hospitals . \nWorkers are being told to follow federal guidelines that recommend anyone involved in oil spill cleanup wear protective equipment such as gloves , safety glasses and clothing . \nMichael J. Schneider , an attorney who decided against filing a class-action lawsuit in the 1990s involving the Valdez workers , said proving a link between oil exposure and health problems is very difficult . \n`` As a human being you listen to enough and you 've got to believe they 're true , '' he said . \n`` The problem is the science may not be there to support them ... Many of the signs and symptoms these people complained of are explainable for a dozen different reasons -- it 's certainly coincidental they all shared a reason in common . '' \nSimilar to the Valdez cleanup , there have been concerns in the Gulf that workers are n't being supplied with enough protective gear . \nWorkers have been spotted in white jumpsuits , gloves and booties but no goggles or respirators . \n`` If they 're out there getting lightheaded and dizzy every day then obviously they ought to come in , and there should be respirators and other equipment provided , '' said LuAnn White , director of the Tulane Center for Applied Environmental Public Health . \nShe added that most of the volatile components that could sicken people generally evaporate before the oil reaches shore . \nBP PLC 's Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said reports of workers getting sick are being investigated but noted that no one has pinpointed the cause . \nSuttles said workers were being given `` any safety equipment '' needed to do their jobs safely . \nUnlike with Exxon Valdez , in the Gulf , the oil has been lighter , the temperatures warm and humid , and there have been hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals used to break up the oil . \nCourt records showed more than 6,700 workers involved in the Exxon Valdez clean up suffered respiratory problems which the company attributed to a viral illness , not chemical poisoning . \nDennis Mestas represented the only known worker to successfully settle with Exxon over health issues . \nAccording to the terms of that confidential settlement , Exxon did not admit fault . \nHis client , Gary Stubblefield , spent four months lifting workers in a crane for 18 hours a day as they sprayed the oil-slicked beaches with hot water , which created an oily mist . \nEven though he had to wipe clean his windshield twice a day , Stubblefield said it never occurred to him that the mixture might be harming his lungs . \nWithin weeks , he and others , who wore little to no protective gear , were coughing and experiencing other symptoms that were eventually nicknamed Valdez crud . \nNow 60 , Stubblefield can not get through a short conversation without coughing and gasping for breath like a drowning man . \nHe sometimes needs the help of a breathing machine and inhalers , and has to be careful not to choke when he drinks and eats . \nWatching the Gulf situation unfold , he says , makes him sick . \nAssociated Press writers John Flesher from Michigan , Brian Skoloff and Kelli Kennedy from Miami contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "748", "time": "2010-06-03", "text": "Shown here is the shoreline of Orange Beach , Ala. , on June 3 , an area potentially vulnerable to the BP oil spill . \n-LRB- AP Photo -RRB- Just as the economy was starting to turn around , the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is threatening to crush the regional industries that rely on coastal waters to survive . \nThe tourism , fishing , energy and shipping economies tied to the Gulf are all expected to take a colossal hit from the spreading leak , which may not be plugged until August . \nWhile images of oil-soaked wildlife give a glimpse into the potential environmental impact of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the economic damage could be just as devastating . \nThe Obama administration is pledging to protect the coastal communities and hit up BP for all recovery costs -- it sent BP a `` preliminary bill '' Thursday for $ 69 million to reimburse taxpayers for cleanup costs and has started a Small Business Administration program to provide low-interest loans to coastal businesses while they await BP compensation . \nBut the question remains whether the oil giant will be able to cover the extent of the economic damages and whether the federal government may be forced to step in to provide aid . \n`` This 'll set things back for some time , '' David Yoskowitz , socio-economics chairman with the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , said of the coastal economy . \nThe Harte institute did an early analysis of the impact last month that put the annual damage at $ 1.8 billion . \nThe center is working on a new estimate now . \n`` The $ 1.8 billion is just the tip of the iceberg , '' Yoskowitz said . \nThe law caps economic damage liability for companies like BP at $ 75 million . \nYoskowitz speculated that BP will probably end up paying more than that but said more aid may be needed . \n`` It 's going to depend upon what BP steps up and offers to do . \n... If they do n't , then you have to look to the various government entities to do that , '' he said . \nThe affected industries in the Gulf region are worth billions of dollars , and they 're already starting to feel the squeeze . \nA recent Texas A&M University study estimated that the oil , tourism , fishing and shipping economies in the region are worth $ 234 billion a year -- with the U.S. accounting for two-thirds of that . \nSince the spill , new offshore drilling in the region has been shut down , tourism reportedly has declined and fishing has been halted in a swath of waters bigger than 88,000 square miles . \nThat 's more than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf . \nNathaniel Karp , chief U.S. economist for the Birmingham-based BBVA Compass bank , released a study early last month estimating the total economic impact to the region at $ 4.3 billion . \nHe , too , is working on new numbers and said the estimate will surely rise . \nAsked what the new estimate might look like , he said : `` That 's a scary number . '' \nThe Democratic Policy Committee put out a snapshot last week pegging the Louisiana commercial fishing economy at $ 2.4 billion and the Florida tourism industry at $ 60 billion . \nThe document said economic damage `` will be significant , '' citing reports of 70 percent declines in hotel occupancy along the Florida panhandle over Memorial Day and other signals that tourists are being spooked . \nKarp explained that the impact will be huge on the Florida panhandle if the situation worsens because of its dependence on tourism . \n`` The region will suffer , '' he said . \n`` Even if you manage to clean what your eyes can see in front of you , if people do n't feel safe it 's going to be very difficult to bring them back , '' he said . \nThe economies were already on shaky ground . \nFlorida 's jobless rate was 12 percent in April . \nMississippi 's was 11.5 percent . \nThe situation sets the stage for an aggressive fight by politicians and communities to get BP to cough up as much as possible . \nThough by law the liability cap for economic damages is set at $ 75 million , that cap is lifted if BP is nailed for negligence -- and investigations are under way . \nThe government can also dip into an industry-backed fund -- called that Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund -- to pay out up to $ 1 billion for `` removal costs or damages . '' \nThe White House insists it will go after BP 's piggy bank . \n`` The president is well aware of the pain and suffering that this accident is causing , '' Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday . \n`` We will hold BP responsible throughout this process . '' \nAaron Saunders , spokesman for Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu , said the senator 's office will be `` holding BP 's feet to the fire . '' \n`` The senator expects BP to pay every penny of the cleanup and related damages , '' he said . \nAdele Morris , policy director for climate and energy economics at the Brookings Institution , said she `` ca n't imagine '' BP will be limited to paying just $ 75 million in economic damages . \nBut she said the regional economies will nevertheless be hit hard while the issue is being litigated . \n`` There 's no question that this adds insult to injury for some already-suffering state and local economies , '' she said . \n"}

'' \nOn Tuesday alone , the first trading day since BP 's latest attempt at a fix failed -- and the day the government announced it had opened a criminal probe into the disaster -- BP 's stock took a hit of 15 percent . \nBP is worth $ 75 billion less on the open market than it was when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded six weeks ago . \nOther companies involved in the spill -- Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron -- have all lost at least 30 percent in value . \nBP says it has spent $ 990 million so far on fighting and cleaning the spill . \nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed no concern about BP going bankrupt or being broken up . \n`` I believe you 've got a company with the type of market capitalization that can and will fully pay for the damage caused on the disaster they 're responsible for , '' he said . \nPresident Obama has repeatedly stated that the government is in charge of the cleanup operation but that BP is responsible for the costs . \nStill , the oil giant 's struggle to contain the oil slick has led to heavy criticism of the administration 's response and calls from some for Obama to temporarily take over BP 's Gulf operations . \n`` We have a national emergency on our hands , '' Robert Reich , President Bill Clinton 's labor secretary , wrote on his website Monday . \n`` No president would allow a nuclear reactor owned by a private for-profit company to melt down in the United States while remaining under the direct control of that company . \nThe meltdown in the Gulf is the environmental equivalent . '' \nReich said a federal takeover of BP is the only way to provide transparency , guarantee competency and ensure Obama is in charge . \n`` If the government can take over giant global insurer AIG and the auto giant General Motors and replace their CEOs in order to keep them financially solvent , it should be able to put BP 's North American operations into temporary receivership in order to stop one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history , '' he wrote . \n`` I 'm not entirely sure what legal mechanism one would have to do that , '' Gibbs said Tuesday . \nGattuso called Reich 's proposal `` stunning , '' and said he must be having some fun and trying to stir the pot . \n`` For the U.S. to take over , unless there 's some statute Reich knows about that he 's not citing , he 's proposing a Venezuelan-style takeover and worrying about legal justifications later , '' he said . \nHe also criticized Reich 's reasoning behind the proposal . \n`` From what we 've learned from the Minerals Management Service '' -- the agency that oversees offshore drilling that has come under heavy fire for a seemingly cozy relationship with the oil industry -- `` and the way the administration has handled the oil spill , the last things we could expect to get is transparency or competency , '' he said . \nReich did not return phone calls seeking comment . \nSusan Bloch , a professor of law at Georgetown University and an expert on constitutional law , told FoxNews.com that it 's unclear when the U.S. could seize BP but that it 's possible if Congress would authorize it . \nShe cited President Harry Truman 's takeover of the steel mills during the Korean War . \nThe Supreme Court later ruled it unconstitutional because Truman did n't get congressional approval . \n`` I 'm not sure what good it would do , '' she said about the U.S. seizing BP . \n`` I do n't know why we would want to run BP .

Hahn , director of coastal zone management for Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish . \n`` That 's what it looks like out here -- like the Gulf is bleeding . \nThis is going to choke the life out of everything . '' \nHe added : `` It makes me want to cry . '' \nSix weeks after the April 20 oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers , the well has leaked somewhere between 22 million and 47 million gallons of oil , according to government estimates . \nA device resembling an upside-down funnel was lowered over the blown-out well a mile beneath the sea late Thursday to try to capture most of the oil and direct it to a ship on the surface . \nBut crude continued to escape into the Gulf through vents designed to prevent ice crystals from clogging the cap . \nEngineers hoped to close several vents throughout the day . \n`` Progress is being made , but we need to caution against overoptimism , '' said Coast Guard Adm.

'' \nRandy Ivie , a charter boat captain , broke down in tears as he tried to explain how sad he was to think that his grandchildren might not see the same white beach and turquoise waters he enjoyed . \n`` It kills me , '' he said . \n`` I grew up here .

'' \nObama had a sensitive political decision to make : Risk putting off two allies in a strategic part of the world once again or endure all the downsides , including an inevitable level of backlash , for being on the other side of the world during a huge crisis at home . \nThe domestic agenda proved dominant . \nAlready , his administration faces scrutiny for its leadership in trying to end the oil spill in the Gulf even as the White House insists it has been forceful from the start . \nWhat began with an exploding oil rig on April 20 has turned into an environmental disaster . \nObama had planned this Asia trip in March -- first shortening it to be in Washington and lobby for health care legislation and then scrapping it altogether to stay for the final crucial days of debate on that top domestic priority . \nCongress ultimately passed the health care law after a huge investment from Obama . \nObama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to explain his decision on Thursday . \nGibbs said Obama planned to meet with both leaders separately on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting , which is to be held near the end of June in Canada . \nThe announcement came as Defense Secretary Robert Gates was meeting with Indonesian defense officials at a security conference in Singapore . \nGates spokesman Geoff Morrell said the postponement did not come up in the meeting . \nAs the trip drew closer and attempts by the BP oil company to plug the gushing oil well proved futile , speculation grew that Obama would be forced to delay the visit for a second time . \n"}

David Vitter , R-La . \n, told Fox News on Friday . \n`` And on top of the recession and on top of the hit that the oil is directly making on our economy , that is another big , big economic blow that is going to knock us down . '' \nVitter suggested the administration instead start an `` immediate and very rigorous '' safety inspection program , while only shutting down those rigs that have problems that ca n't be addressed immediately . \nVitter said he planned to speak with Obama about the issue during his visit to the Gulf coast Friday -- the president 's third since the oil leak began . \nThe senator wrote in a letter to Obama on Thursday that the deepwater drilling ban , which is estimated to affect 33 rigs in the Gulf , could eliminate up to 4,000 Louisiana jobs in the short-term and `` possibly 20,000 jobs throughout the course of the year . '' \nSen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . \n, warned about the danger of a permanent flight of the industry from the region . \n`` If these big rigs ever leave the Gulf ... it 's not like you can make those every day or every year . \nSome of them take years to build . \nIf they leave the Gulf and go drill under long-term contracts off the coast of Africa , they 're not coming home any time soon , '' she said . \nThe Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association , a trade group representing oil and gas interests in the Gulf region , estimates that lost wages from all 33 rigs could total $ 330 million per month . \nThe National Ocean Industries Association , citing the figures , said in a statement that the six-month moratorium will `` make things much worse by putting more Gulf citizens out of work . '' \nObama was looking to expand offshore drilling before the BP disaster . \nThe explosion led him to rethink that element of his energy plan , as he delayed or canceled lease sales in the Gulf , off the coast of Virginia and off the coast of Alaska . \nThe White House on Thursday acknowledged there will be job losses from the moratorium . \n`` I do n't think there 's any doubt , '' Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . \nBut he argued that the commission investigating the incident needs to be able to first determine what `` failsafe '' measures can be implemented to prevent future disasters . \n`` I think that 's important . \nThe president thought that was important . \nI think that the citizens of the Gulf think that 's important , '' Gibbs said . \n"}

'' \nSo far , Deepwater Horizon has spilled an estimated 21 million to 45 million gallons of oil . \nBP managed to place a funnel-like cap on the well late Thursday with the aim of pumping some crude to the surface , but it was too early to tell if would work or how much oil they could collect . \nIf the Pemex disaster serves as a precedent , the BP spill could continue even after the two relief wells are expected to be finished in August . \nBy then , it could surpass Ixtoc as the worst oil spill in history , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . \n`` We are looking at an August time frame for stopping it , '' Patzek said . \n`` If for one reason or another that stopping is left imperfect or it takes another drill or what have you , we 're looking at another four months , at that time this spill would look like the Ixtoc spill . '' \nThe BP spill , at a depth of nearly 5,000 feet , is proving more complicated to choke off than Ixtoc , a shallow-water rig about 150 feet deep . \nThe Ixtoc well could be accessed directly , while the Deepwater spill must be combated remotely , using robots to wield clamps , saws and other tools while monitoring the action by video feed . \n`` They could fight Ixtoc from and at the surface , '' said Robert Bea , a professor of engineering at University of California at Berkeley who has studied offshore drilling for 55 years and worked for Pemex for a number of years . \nFor Deepwater , `` they must fight from the sea floor remotely , from the sea surface miles above . '' \nMost recently , BP tried to stop the gusher by pumping in heavy drilling mud and cement . \nThe tactic , called a `` top kill , '' had never been tried 5,000 feet underwater . \nIt did n't work . \nThe good news is the Ixtoc experience suggests the Gulf of Mexico has natural properties that help it cope with massive oil spills , scientists say . \nWarm waters and sunlight helped break down the oil faster than many expected . \nWeathering reduced much of the oil into tar balls by the time it reached Texas . \nTwo decades after the Ixtoc disaster , marine biologist Wes Tunnell sank his diving knife into an area where he had spotted a tar patch just after the spill . \nThe blade came out black and tarry but the hardened surface of the patch was under sand , shells and algae that had completely covered it . \n`` No one else would know that it was anything other than a rock ledge , '' said Tunnell of the Harte institute . \n`` I think that the Gulf of Mexico is hugely resilient , or at least it was 30 years ago . \nWe 've insulted it a lot since then in various ways . '' \nThe Gulf has also long dealt with oil that naturally seeps from the seafloor . \nSome experts estimate that tens of millions of gallons seep into the Gulf from natural up-wellings each year , fostering large populations of oil-eating bacteria and microorganisms . \nHowever , it is unclear how much any of that will help this time around . \nThe Deepwater spill is closer to sensitive coastlines than Ixtoc was . \nAnd it is affecting Louisiana marshlands that are more sensitive than the more sparsely populated Texan and Mexican coastlines that Ixtoc reached . \n`` Obviously there were some helping factors -- nature , climate , current -- that in the end helped people -LRB- with Ixtoc -RRB- so that 's good news , '' said Patzek . \n`` However ... the Ixtoc well seemed to have been a little farther out from sensitive places . '' \nThe depth of the BP spill could also complicate the Gulf 's ability to cope . \nThe oil-eating bacterial populations are located mainly on the surface or near shore , where the Ixtoc oil appeared . \nBP has tried to break up the oil deep underwater , pumping chemical dispersants directly into the damaged well . \nThat could be a mistake , McKinney said . \nWhile chemically dispersing the oil keeps the spill less visible and ugly than Ixtoc , it prevents the oil from floating up to the surface where wind , waves , bacteria and sunlight could help break it up , he said . \nAnd some environmentalists question the safety of the dispersant itself . \n`` I know , out of sight , out of mind , '' McKinney said . \n`` But also , out of sight is what can kill you , like a cancer , and that may be the bigger problem . '' \nPemex estimates that about half the Ixtoc oil may have burned away in the rig fire that lasted months . \nAbout a quarter dispersed and the rest was either recovered or evaporated . \nIxtoc threatened coral , sea turtles , shrimp and commercially valuable fish . \nSome species have rebounded while others have drastically declined . \nJack Woody , a retired officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , was in northern Mexico a month after the Ixtoc spill , leading the U.S.-Mexico effort to save the Kemp 's ridley sea turtles . \nHe watched as the oil slick closed in and tar balls began washing up at the Rancho Nuevo beach , the only significant nesting ground for the female turtles , which had dwindled to a population of about 300 . \nHatchlings were just emerging , and helicopters desperately tried to ferry the baby turtles to open ocean beyond the slick . \n`` I thought we were too late , '' Woody said . \nThe turtle population continued to dwindle until 1988 but has since rebounded to up to 12,000 , due in part to programs to relocate hatchlings to safer beaches in Texas and cut down on turtle deaths in shrimp nets . \n`` I was wrong . \nThis is the one time I like to be wrong , '' Woody said . \nScientists say it is difficult to know how much long-term damage Ixtoc caused because it is hard to separate the effects of the spill from overfishing , sediment , runoff and other pollution . \nTunnel said his students saw coral islands ringed by oil `` like black doughnuts '' after Ixtoc . \nMany of those islands have since lost most of their coral cover but Tunnel could not say whether the spill was to blame . \nOther causes , he said , could include overfishing of coral-friendly fish , coral collecting and sewage . \nAfter five years or so , the tar mats on Texas beaches largely disappeared , probably broken up and swept seaward , and Ixtoc was largely forgotten for 30 years , until another explosion on an offshore oil rig in a different part of the Gulf . \n"}

'' \nThe president , in a sudden move , canceled plans to travel to Indonesia and Australia later in the month -- a trip that was already canceled earlier in the year because Obama wanted to concentrate on the health care debate in Congress . \nWhite House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that the president was `` enraged '' about how long it 's taken for BP to plug the leak . \nAt the same time , the White House is pushing back on the notion that the president should be jumping up and down about the spill . \n`` I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people . \nBut that 's not the job I was hired to do . \nMy job is to solve this problem , '' Obama said in a televised interview Thursday night . \n`` Pounding on a podium is n't going to fix a hole in the ocean , '' Gibbs said Thursday . \n`` I think what the American people and the citizens of the Gulf are expecting are results . \nAnd I think that 's what the president will be measured by . \nI 'll leave emotional psychiatry to others . '' \nThe president 's tone has been ripe for criticism even among his supporters . \nDemocratic strategist James Carville demanded that Obama `` get down here , '' and film director Spike Lee urged the `` calm '' and `` cool '' president to , `` one time , go off ! '' \nJon Stewart , on '' The Daily Show , '' ridiculed the president for trying to balance the ceremonial duties of the president -- like attendance at cultural heritage events -- with management of the spill . \nNew York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that Obama has `` willfully and inexplicably resisted fulfilling a signal part of his job : being a prism in moments of fear and pride , reflecting what Americans feel so they know he gets it .

David Vitter , R-La . \n, told Fox News on Friday about the images of wildlife . \nBP said Friday it has started to capture and siphon some of the leaking oil after jamming a cap onto the well . \nThe long-term solution -- drilling relief wells -- is not expected to be completed until August at the earliest . \nEleven workers were killed in the April 20 oil rig explosion that triggered the leak . \n"}
{"id": "1181", "time": "2010-06-04", "text": "June 4 : Oil is seen gushing around the cap placed by BP during efforts to contain the Deepwater Horizon leak in the Gulf . \nBP GRAND ISLE , La. -- A cap was seated atop a blown-out Gulf well but the volcano of oil obscured it from view early Friday making it impossible to tell if BP 's latest attempt to curtail the nation 's worst spill was having any success . \nRobots a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico positioned the inverted funnel-like lid over the main pipe on the leaking well on Thursday night . \nLive video footage , though , showed that the oil seemed unimpeded . \nBP spokesman Toby Odone said he had no immediate information on whether the cap was successfully attached . \nThe placement was a positive step but not a solution , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the disaster . \n`` Even if successful , this is only a temporary and partial fix and we must continue our aggressive response operations at the source , on the surface and along the Gulf 's precious coastline , '' Allen said in a statement . \nA rubber seal on the inside of the cap will attempt to keep oil from escaping , though engineers acknowledge some crude will still come out . \nThe plan is to capture most of the spewing oil and bring it to a surface ship . \nTo put the cap in place , BP had to slice off the pipe with giant shears , which was risky because it could temporarily increase the flow by as much as 20 percent . \nAlso , the shears made a less-precise cut , making it more difficult for the lid to fit . \nIf the idea fails -- like every other attempt to control the six-week-old leak -- the best chance is probably a relief well , which is at least two months away . \nThe well has spit out between 21 million and 46 million gallons of oil since a rig exploded on April 20 about 50 miles from the Louisiana coast , killing 11 workers . \nBP was leasing the rig and is responsible to fix and clean up the spill . \nIn oil-soaked Grand Isle , Jason French might as well have painted a bulls-eye on his back . \nHis mission was to be BP 's representative at a meeting for 50 or so residents who had gathered at a church to vent . \n`` We are all angry and frustrated , '' he said . \n`` Feel free tonight to let me see that anger . \nDirect at me , direct it at BP , but I want to assure you , the folks in this community , that we are working hard to remedy the situation . '' \n`` Sorry does n't pay the bills , '' said Susan Felio Price , a longtime resident . \n`` Through the negligence of BP we now find ourselves trying to roller-skate up a mountain , '' she said . \n`` We 're growing really weary . \nWe 're sick and tired of being sick and tired . \nSomeone 's got to help us get to the top of that mountain . '' \nPresident Barack Obama might also hear some of that anger . \nHe will return to the Louisiana coast Friday to assess the latest efforts , his third trip to the region since the disaster unfolded and his second in a week . \nHe told CNN 's Larry King that he , too , was frustrated and used his strongest language in assailing BP . \n`` I am furious at this entire situation because this is an example where somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions , '' Obama said . \n`` This is imperiling an entire way of life and an entire region for potentially years . '' \nCrews will also use methanol to try to prevent icylike crystals from forming on the inside of the cap . \nAt this depth a mile underwater , the near-freezing temperatures can cause a buildup up of hydrates , which foiled the company 's attempt to place a 100-ton , four-story dome over the leak about a month ago . \nMeanwhile , newly disclosed internal Coast Guard documents from the day after the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig indicated that U.S. officials were warning of a leak of 336,000 gallons per day of crude from the well in the event of a complete blowout . \nThe volume turned out to be much closer to that figure than the 42,000 gallons per day that BP first estimated . \nWeeks later that was revised to 210,000 gallons . \nNow , an estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons of crude is believed to be leaking daily . \nThe Center for Public Integrity , which initially reported the Coast Guard logs , said it obtained them from Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . \n, ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . \nThe logs also showed early in the disaster that remote underwater robots were unable to activate the rig 's blowout preventer , which was supposed to shut off the flow from the well in the event of such a catastrophic failure . \nThe damage to the environment was chilling on East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast , where workers found birds coated in thick , black goo . \nImages shot by an Associated Press photographer show Brown pelicans drenched in thick oil , struggling and flailing in the surf . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward promised that the company would clean up every drop of oil and `` restore the shoreline to its original state . '' \n`` BP will be here for a very long time . \nWe realize this is just the beginning , '' he said . \nThose on Grand Isle seemed less than convinced by BP 's assurances . \n`` We want you to feel what we feel , '' said Leoda Bladsacker , a member of the town 's council , as her voice trembled . \n`` We 're not going to be OK for a long , long time .

{"id": "318", "time": "2010-05-23", "text": "President Obama 's oversight of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill may have been hampered by his relationship to BP , former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Sunday in the opening salvo of a verbal cage match with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs . \nAppearing on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Palin suggested that the White House is too cozy with the oil industry because of contributions to candidate Obama during the 2008 presidential race . \n`` I do n't know why the question is n't asked by the mainstream media and by others if there 's any connection with the contributions made to President Obama and his administration and the support by the oil companies to the administration , '' Palin , a Fox News Channel contributor , said on `` Fox News Sunday . '' \n`` If there 's any connection there to President Obama taking so doggone long to get in there , to dive in there , and grasp the complexity and the potential tragedy that we are seeing here in the Gulf of Mexico -- now , if this was President Bush or if this were a Republican in office who had n't received as much support even as President Obama has from B.P. and other oil companies , you know the mainstream media would be all over his case , '' she said . \nGibbs fired back that the former Alaska governor needs a lesson in how the oil industry works . \n`` Sarah Palin was involved in that election but , I do n't think she was paying a whole lot of attention , '' Gibbs said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' \n`` I 'm almost sure that the oil companies do n't consider the Obama administration a huge ally , '' he said , adding , `` My suggestion to Sarah Palin would be to get slightly more informed as to what 's going on in and around oil drilling in this country . '' \nPalin used Twitter shortly thereafter to respond to Gibbs . \n`` Obama is the top recipient of BP PAC & individual money over the past 20 years . \nDispute these facts , '' she wrote , linking to a Politico article citing campaign finance reporting showing more than $ 3.5 million given to candidates by BP since 1990 . \nThe largest single donation by BP -- $ 77,051 -- went to Obama . \nHowever , Palin did not point to another set of numbers reported by campaign watchdog , the Center for Responsive Politics , which showed the oil and gas industry overall contributed $ 2.4 million to John McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign while $ 898,000 went for Obama 's bid . \nThe Gulf oil spill began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nAt least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since , though many scientists say it 's likely much more than that . \nGibbs said the Obama administration is doing whatever it can to work with BP to cap the spill , but BP has not been as transparent as it could be . \n`` We asked that a video feed be made public , and that took 10 days . \nWe are -- we have sent letters recently in order to get them to post their air and water quality data and to ensure that the dispersants that they 're spraying on top of the water and using it at a sub-sea level are the least toxic available , '' he said . \nBut Gibbs added that `` the president has told the team to spare nothing in trying to cap this well . '' \nGibbs said he did not think that the oil spill would be the administration 's `` Hurricane Katrina , '' which deeply wounded President George W. Bush 's second term . \nGibbs said the Obama administration is aggressively dealing with the aftermath of the spill . \n`` Well , I think if you look back at what happened in Katrina , the government was n't there to respond to what was happening . \nThat , quite frankly , was the problem , even tracking the hurricane for days and knowing fairly precisely where it was going to hit , '' Gibbs said . \n`` I think the difference in this case is , we were there immediately . \nWe have been there ever since . '' \nGibbs agreed that government and the oil companies do n't get into a cozy relationship . \n`` We have to regulate this industry . \nWe have to make sure that their safety standards are up to the very latest and highest standards whenever they do something like this , drilling in such a precious ecosystem as the Gulf of Mexico , '' Gibbs said . \nPalin too said she still supports offshore drilling , but also thinks oil companies need to be accountable for accidents . \n`` I am still a strong supporter of domestic energy supplies being extracted . \nHaving said that , these oil companies have got to be held accountable when there is any kind of lax and preventative measures to result in a tragedy like we 're seeing right now in the Gulf , '' she said . \nAs the administration continues to fight the perception that it has n't done enough to cap the gusher , three top Obama administration officials were returning to the Gulf Coast to monitor the spill response . \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa P.

{"id": "1610", "time": "2010-09-16", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico has not increased unemployment in the region , says a new report from the Obama administration . \nLouisiana lawmakers and the oil and gas industry immediately disputed the finding . \nThe report , released at a Senate hearing Thursday , said the moratorium imposed after the BP oil spill likely caused a temporary loss of 8,000 to 12,000 jobs in the Gulf region , including about 2,000 on deepwater rigs . \nTotal industry spending in the region decreased by nearly $ 2 billion , the report said , most of it by drilling operators . \nBut the report found no large increases in unemployment claims , thanks in part to a big hiring push for cleanup crews and massive spending by BP on the recovery effort . \nThe scenario is far rosier than described in some previous reports , including an Interior Department estimate over the summer that 23,000 jobs could be lost to the moratorium . \nSen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . \n, a leading critic of the moratorium , attacked the report and said the `` heavy hand of the federal government '' was placing thousands of jobs in the Gulf at risk . \n`` I find it stunning that the administration was aware that their actions might eliminate nearly 23,000 jobs in an already faltering economy and proceeded anyway , '' Landrieu said . \n`` That decision has imperiled thousands of small businesses who are reliant on the revenue generated by the oil and gas industry . '' \nLandrieu and fellow Louisiana Sen. David Vitter repeatedly challenged the report 's accuracy and noted that it did not address what they called a de facto moratorium on shallow-water drilling . \nFewer than a dozen shallow-water drilling permits have been issued in recent months , compared with an average of 40 a month before the BP spill , they said . \nVitter , a Republican , told a Commerce Department official that the report 's upbeat analysis was at odds with reality in the Gulf . \n`` I have to tell you , I talk to these people every day . \nIt sure as heck is not what they are telling me , '' he told Commerce Undersecretary Rebecca Blank at a hearing of Senate Small Business Committee . \n`` Every day I hear the exact opposite . '' \nJim Noe , executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition , said it was outrageous that the report credited spill cleanup work as a net positive for the Gulf Coast . \n`` Spinning this as a positive is like saying that a hurricane is good for the economy because of all of the rebuilding work it will provide afterward , '' Noe said . \n`` It 's the cleanup that 's ` temporary , ' not the impact of the moratorium . '' \nLouisiana State University economist Joseph Mason called the report overly optimistic , noting that it did not address shallow-water drilling and assumed that job losses would stop once the moratorium ends . \n`` The White House characterizes these as the most probable numbers . \nI characterize them as the lower bounds , '' Mason said . \nStill , Mason 's own study offered a similar conclusion , projecting that the moratorium could cost the Gulf Coast at least 8,169 jobs , $ 2.1 billion in economic activity and $ 98 million in lost revenue from state and local taxes . \nMason , who also works with the American Energy Alliance , a pro-industry group , said his estimates of job losses will grow if the moratorium continues beyond six months . \nVitter said he was astonished to learn that the Obama administration did not do an economic analysis before imposing the moratorium in May , calling that inexcusable . \nBut Blank , the Commerce Department official , said that in the wake of the BP spill , officials were focused on safety . \n`` The concern for protecting the environment , protecting the safety of the drilling industry , was the paramount concern , '' she said . \nBlank told the Senate panel that of 41 rigs operating in deep waters at the time of the moratorium , only five have left the Gulf . \nThe new report said other surveys , including the one by Interior , measured worst-case scenarios that never came to pass . \nInstead , the report said , the majority of rig workers have kept their jobs during the moratorium as the oil industry used the opportunity to repair rigs or kept skilled workers employed in anticipation that deep-water drilling would resume . \nPresident Barack Obama imposed the deepwater drilling moratorium in May following the April 20 oil well blowout that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf before it was capped in mid-July . \nMeant to allow time to ensure adequate safety and cleanup procedures are in place on other deepwater drilling rigs , the moratorium is scheduled to last through November , although federal officials have indicated it could end before then . \nIt 's also being challenged in court . \nOfficials in Louisiana and elsewhere contend the moratorium is an unnecessary job-killer , but Thursday 's report disagreed . \nIt found no greater rise in unemployment in the five Louisiana parishes most affected by the moratorium than elsewhere in the state or nation . \n`` There is no evidence of declining employment after the moratorium was announced , '' the report said . \nThe report focuses narrowly on the moratorium and does not seek to measure wider economic impacts from the oil spill itself -- for example , on fishing or tourism . \nThe report finds a modest impact on oil and natural gas production in the Gulf from the moratorium , which should not affect the price of oil . \nThe reductions are small compared to worldwide production and come at a time when overall production is up , the report said . \n"}

The robots then began using a diamond saw to shear off the remaining parts of the riser to create a smooth opening at the top of the LMRP . \nThe saw got stuck during the process , and the robots and clamps are trying to free it to finish the job ... If the saw shears a smooth opening , BP will lower a containment cap with a grommet seal over it . \nThe leak will continue gushing from the top of the LMRP during the process ... The containment cap is intended to capture about 80 percent of the oil and gas . \nThe rest is expected to escape ... The cap will be connected by pipe to a drillship at the water 's surface a mile above the well ... The captured oil and gas is expected to be channeled to the ship , where the oil will be stored to bring ashore later for processing and the gas will be flared ... BP expects the process to take four to seven days , though Chief Executive Tony Hayward said before the saw became stuck that it would take four days ... BP monitored pressure data from the failed blowout preventer during the top kill operation , and determined that cutting off the pipe at the top of the LMRP would not have a significant impact on the flow of the leak . \nDispersants are being sprayed at the leak site during the LMRP operation ... U.S. government scientists estimated the flow could temporarily increase by as much as 20 percent ... The cap effort is , in theory , similar to a much larger 98-ton containment dome that was placed at the end of the broken pipe in early May . \nThat dome also was connected to the ship by pipe and was intended to corral and channel oil and gas to the surface ... In that cap effort , too much seawater got inside , mixed with natural gas at high pressures and cold temperatures , and formed ice-like hydrates that blocked oil from flowing up the pipe to the ship ... The smaller cap and seal are designed to exclude seawater and avoid the hydrate problem ... The cut at the top of the LMRP needs to leave a smooth surface for the containment cap 's seal to work as planned ... If the containment cap does n't work , BP can try to install a `` top hat '' already at the seabed , or a smaller version of the containment dome that does not have a seal ... Other backup containment caps and domes are being manufactured with variations on the seal to have options if needed . \nENHANCEMENT TO LMRP CAP PLAN . . \nBP will use seabed equipment installed to conduct the top kill to enhance the containment cap system ... The top kill involved pumping heavy drilling fluid into the failed blowout preventer to try to smother the leak . \nMud was pumped from a ship to a service rig , down to a manifold , which routed the fluid to `` choke and kill '' hoses connected to the blowout preventer ... BP will try to reverse direction and pull oil and gas from the blowout preventer through the hoses and manifold to a vessel at the water 's surface ... That system is expected to be ready by mid-June ... BP also is planning a system to allow the drillship connected by pipe to the containment cap to suspend operations and move if a hurricane approaches ... BP will install a pipe that extends about 300 feet below the drillship . \nThen a hose would connect the pipe to the containment cap ... Described by BP as a `` long-term option , '' the system would allow BP to disconnect the hose from the pipe and move the ship out of a storm 's path , then return when weather calms to resume the operation ... BP has not yet worked out how it would cap or corral the leak while the storm passes and the hose is disconnected from the pipe ... The system is expected to be implemented in late June or early July ... The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 ... Drilling continued on a relief well begun May 2 intended to intercept and cap the leaking well beneath the seabed . \nDrilling was suspended last week on a second relief well begun May 16 while the top kill was in progress , but that rig resumed drilling Sunday . \nBoth wells are expected to be finished in August . \n"}

'' \nLe , like other of the fishermen , received $ 5,000 from BP PLC , but it was quickly gone . \n`` I call that ` Shut your mouth money , '' ' said Murray Volk , 46 , of Empire , who 's been fishing for nearly 30 years . \n`` That wo n't pay the insurance on my boat and house . \nThey say there 'll be more later , but do you think the electric company will wait for that ? '' \nBP may have bigger problems , though . \nAttorney General Eric Holder , who visited the Gulf on Tuesday to survey the fragile coastline and meet with state and federal prosecutors , would not say who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \n`` We will closely examine the actions of those involved in the spill . \nIf we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said in New Orleans . \nThe federal government also ramped up its response to the spill with President Barack Obama ordering the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster , `` to follow the facts wherever they lead , without fear or favor . '' \nThe president said that if laws are insufficient , they 'll be changed . \nHe said that if government oversight was n't tough enough , that will change , too . \nBP 's stock nose-dived on Tuesday , losing nearly 15 percent of its value on the first trading day since the previous best option -- the so-called top kill -- failed and was aborted at the government 's direction . \nIt dipped steeply with Holder 's late-afternoon announcement , which also sent other energy stocks tumbling , ultimately causing the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 112 . \nIf BP 's new effort to contain the leak fails , the procedure will have made the biggest oil spill in U.S. history even worse . \n`` It is an engineer 's nightmare , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences . \n`` They 're trying to fit a 21-inch cap over a 20-inch pipe a mile away . \nThat 's just horrendously hard to do . \nIt 's not like you and I standing on the ground pushing -- they 're using little robots to do this . '' \nSince the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , eventually collapsing into the Gulf of Mexico , an estimated 20 million to 40 million gallons of oil has spewed , eclipsing the 11 million that leaked from the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nBP PLC 's Doug Suttles said that although there 's no guarantee the company 's latest cut-and-cap effort to close off the leak will work , he remained hopeful , but would n't guarantee success . \nEngineers have put underwater robots and equipment in place this week after a bold attempt to plug the well by force-feeding it heavy mud and cement -- called a `` top kill '' -- was aborted over the weekend . \nCrews pumped thousands of gallons of the mud into the well but were unable to overcome the pressure of the oil . \nThe company said if the small dome is successful it could capture and siphon a majority of the gushing oil to the surface . \nBut the cut and cap will not halt the oil flow , just capture some of it and funnel it to vessels waiting at the surface . \nThe British oil giant has tried and failed repeatedly to halt the flow of the oil , and this attempt like others has never been tried before a mile beneath the ocean . \nExperts warned it could be even riskier than the others because slicing open the 20-inch riser could unleash more oil if there was a kink in the pipe that restricted some of the flow . \nEric Smith , an associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute , likened the procedure to trying to place a tiny cap on a fire hydrant that 's blowing straight up . \n`` Will they have enough weight to overcome the force of the flow ? '' \n`` It could create a lot of turbulence , but I do think they 'll have enough weight . '' \nBut BP 's best chance to actually plug the leak rests with a pair of relief wells but those wo n't likely be completed until August . \nThe company has carefully prepared the next phase , knowing that another failure could mean millions more gallons spew into the ocean and lead to even more public pressure . \nAnd they say they have learned valuable lessons from the failure of a bigger version of the containment cap last month that was clogged with icelike slush . \n"}

{"id": "597", "time": "2010-05-25", "text": "May 23 : An oil-covered pelican flaps its wings on an island in Barataria Bay off the coast of Louisiana . \nAP2010 WASHINGTON -- Responding to the massive BP oil spill , Congress is getting ready to quadruple -- to 32 cents a barrel -- a tax on oil used to help finance cleanups . \nThe increase would raise nearly $ 11 billion over the next decade . \nThe tax is levied on oil produced in the U.S. or imported from foreign countries . \nThe revenue goes to a fund managed by the Coast Guard to help pay to clean up spills in waterways , such as the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe tax increase is part of a larger bill that has grown into a nearly $ 200 billion grab bag of unfinished business that lawmakers hope to complete before Memorial Day . \nThe key provisions are a one-year extension of about 50 popular tax breaks that expired at the end of last year , and expanded unemployment benefits , including subsidies for health insurance , through the end of the year . \nThe House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday , though Democrats were still working Monday to round up the votes . \nDemocratic leaders had wanted to hold a vote Tuesday . \nThere has been little public opposition to the oil tax from the petroleum industry . \nBut the overall bill would add about $ 134 billion to the federal budget deficit , drawing opposition from Republicans and some Democrats . \nSenate leaders hope to complete work on the bill before Congress goes on a weeklong break next week . \nThe Obama administration issued a statement Monday supporting the bill . \nLawmakers want to increase the current 8-cent-a-barrel tax on oil to make sure there is enough money available to respond to oil spills . \nAt least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig exploded April 20 off the Louisiana coast . \nPresident Barack Obama and congressional leaders have said they expect BP to foot the bill for the cleanup . \n`` Taxpayers will not pick up the tab , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . \nBP executives told Congress last week they would pay `` all legitimate claims '' for damages . \nBut the government needs upfront money to respond to spills , as well as money to pay for cleanups when the responsible party is unable to pay , or is unknown . \nMoney spent from the fund can later be recovered from the company responsible for the spill . \nThe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has about $ 1.5 billion available . \nUnder current law , only $ 1 billion can be spent from the fund on a single incident . \nThe bill would increase the spending limit to $ 5 billion . \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the tax increase was hastily put together , without adequate study , to help pay for an unrelated bill . \nThe tax increase was unveiled Thursday , without any congressional hearings to study its impact . \n`` I have seen no analysis on how this would impact energy security , how this would impact domestic production , how this would impact the overall economics in the country , '' said Christopher Guith , vice president of the chamber 's energy institute . \n`` There has n't been any sort of deliberation on this . '' \nGuith said the tax could be passed on to consumers , depending on the ability of oil companies to raise gas prices in response to a tax increase . \nLawmakers felt the tax increase , to 32 cents a barrel , was reasonable , said Rep. Sander Levin , D-Mich . \n, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee . \n`` We just decided to take a look at what we thought would be a reasonable increase , '' Levin said . \nThe American Petroleum Institute has not taken a position on the tax increase , though a spokeswoman said Congress should study the ramifications before acting . \n`` We understand we need to have an insurance policy in order to cover people in the event of a spill , '' said the spokeswoman , Cathy Landry . \n`` At the same time we need to have a vital oil and gas industry . '' \nThe bill does not address a federal law that caps liability at $ 75 million for economic damages beyond direct cleanup costs . \nDemocratic Senators tried to pass a bill last week that would have increased the cap to $ 10 billion , but they were blocked by Republicans . \nThe oil industry says such a high cap would make it difficult , if not impossible , to insure oil rigs . \nBP said Monday its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million . \n"}
{"id": "1383", "time": "2010-05-25", "text": "A summary of events on Tuesday , May 25 , Day 34 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that began with the April 20 explosion and fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP PLC , which is in charge of cleanup and containment . \nThe blast killed 11 workers . \nSince then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well at a rate of at least 210,000 gallons per day . \nBP is going in for the kill . \nThe trick is to do the job quickly and cleanly . \nAs early as dawn Wednesday , the oil company will try to choke the gusher at the bottom of the sea by force-feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement . \nThe tactic , called a `` top kill , '' is routinely used above ground but has never been tried 5,000 feet underwater . \nIf it 's not done just right , it could make the leak worse . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward pegged its chances of success in this case at 60 percent to 70 percent . \nEngineers were doing at least 12 hours of diagnostic tests Tuesday . \nThey planned to check five spots on the well 's crippled five-story blowout preventer to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the mud . \nA weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak . \nBob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , estimated that anything above 1.6 million gallons a day would be too much for a top kill to work . \nLive video of the leak has been available online for the past few days . \nRep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . \n, said he learned that it would be shut off while BP attempts the top kill . \nBut BP said late Tuesday that it has agreed at the request of the Obama administration to show video of the top kill . \nRecently , the video has shown the underwater plume getting significantly darker . \nA top oil engineering expert says that suggests heavier , more-polluting oil is spewing out . \nThe color of the oil gushing from the main pipe has changed in color from medium gray to black . \nTwo scientists noticed the change , which oil company BP downplayed as a natural fluctuation that is not likely permanent . \nIf the top kill does n't work , or makes the problem worse , BP will probably turn to a containment box resting on the seafloor . \nIt is a smaller version of the 100-ton box the company lowered several weeks ago in hopes of capturing much of the oil . \nThat larger device was clogged with ice crystals and BP had to abandon it , but the company hopes the smaller version might work better . \nBP says it siphoned more oil with a mile-long tube after two days of falling totals from a leaking seafloor well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP PLC spokesman John Curry told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the tube collected some 256,200 gallons of oil on Monday . \nThe collections were further evidence that a previous estimate -- that the entire spill was 210,000 gallons a day -- was too low . \nBP is complying with the government 's request to use less of a toxic dispersant in fighting the Gulf oil spill , but alternative dispersants are n't so readily available , the White House 's energy adviser said Tuesday . \nIn a letter to BP last week , the Environmental Protection Agency gave the oil giant three days to find a less toxic alternative to the dispersant , Corexit 9500 , that it is using to break up the oil . \nBut in a series of meetings that followed , White House energy adviser Carol Browner said , it became clear the alternatives were not as widely available as needed . \nStaff members at an agency that oversees offshore drilling accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography , according to an Interior Department report alleging a culture of cronyism between regulators and the industry . \nIn at least one case , an inspector for the Minerals Management Service admitted using crystal methamphetamine and said he might have been under the influence of the drug the next day at work , according to the report by the acting inspector general of the Interior Department . \nThe report cites a variety of violations of federal regulations and ethics rules at the agency 's Louisiana office . \nPrevious inspector general investigations have focused on inappropriate behavior by the royalty-collection staff in the agency 's Denver office . \nPresident Barack Obama , seeking to show command of a crisis that has exasperated the nation , will head back to Louisiana on Friday to review efforts to stop the disastrous Gulf oil spill . \nThe White House announced Obama 's trip but did not yet release details of exactly where he will go . \nThe president will be in Louisiana for the day on Friday , flying there from Chicago , where he will be spending the long holiday weekend , and returning there at night . \nEleven men who died in the offshore rig explosion that triggered the Gulf oil spill were honored at a somber memorial service with tributes from country music stars and drilling company executives . \nTransocean , owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , organized the event , held under tight security at the Jackson Convention Complex . \nIt was impossible to judge the reactions of those attending . \nReporters were n't allowed inside but were ushered to a room where the service was broadcast on closed-circuit television . \nThe Gulf of Mexico oil spill has constantly been measured against the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which leaked nearly 11 million gallons of crude , killed countless animals and tarnished the owner of the damaged tanker , Exxon . \nYet the leader of botched containment efforts in the critical hours after the tanker ran aground was n't Exxon Mobil Corp. . \nIt was BP PLC , the same firm now fighting to plug the Gulf leak . \nPeople who had a front row seat to the Alaska spill tell The Associated Press that BP 's actions in the Gulf suggest it has n't changed much at all . \nAs the thick oil from the BP spill bubbles through the Gulf of Mexico , threatening sea life and wetlands , foodies are taking up knife , fork and wine glass to defend the equally vulnerable reputation of the coast 's seafood industry . \nThe New Orleans Wine and Food Experience , an annual celebration of the city 's love of all things tasty , is pairing wines from around the world with the cooking of some of the city 's best chefs to help deliver the message : Louisiana seafood is still safe , available and delicious . \nFlorida tourism officials are taking to the airwaves to try and combat worries over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nThe Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association is running radio advertisements across the U.S. that say `` our coast is clean and our beaches are open . '' \nIt 's also running a full-page ad in USA Today with a similar message . \nThe Coast Guard says around 100 tar balls have been recovered throughout the Florida Keys in the last week , but none have been linked to the massive Gulf of Mexico spill . \nCapt. Pat DeQuattro said Tuesday an early analysis has been able to rule out that the tar balls came from the Deepwater Horizon spill . \nMore analysis is needed to determine where they did come from . \n"}
{"id": "1551", "time": "2010-05-25", "text": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Oil spill frustration is rampant . \nThe White House is being pounded for not acting more aggressively in the month-old oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe administration is hitting back , mostly at BP . \nLouisiana is threatening to take matters into its own hands . \nThe truth is , the government has little direct experience at either the national or state level at stopping deepwater oil leaks -- and few realistic options . \nWith the oil flowing and spreading at a furious rate , President Barack Obama has accused BP of a `` breakdown of responsibility . '' \nHe named a special independent commission to review what happened . \nBut the administration seems to want to have it both ways -- insisting it 's in charge while also insisting that BP do the heavy lifting . \nThe White House is arguing that government officials are n't just watching from the sidelines , but also acknowledging there 's just so much the government can do directly . \n`` They are 5,000 feet down . \nBP or the private sector alone have the means to deal with that problem down there . \nIt 's not government equipment that is going to be used to do that , '' Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen told a White House briefing on Monday . \n`` They are the responsible party . \nBut we have the authority to direct them , '' he added . \nThere are political risks both ways . \nIf the federal government took control somehow , it would own the problem and any failure would belong to Obama . \nBut the flip side is that Obama could suffer politically if his administration is seen as falling short of staying on top of the problem or not working hard to find a solution . \nAll of BP 's attempts to stop the leak have failed . \nIt was to try another technique on Wednesday in which heavy mud and cement would be shot into the well to plug it up . \nWhite House energy adviser Carol Browner made the rounds of morning television news shows on Tuesday , expressing continued frustration but also voicing hope that Wednesday 's procedure would succeed where others have failed . \nAs to who is running the show , `` We have been in charge and we 'll continue to be in charge . \nBut clearly BP has expertise and that needs to be brought to bear , '' she told CBS . \nIn the past , the government has turned to oil industry experts to deal with oil disasters . \nIt famously recruited legendary oil well fighters Paul N. `` Red '' Adair and Edward `` Coots '' Matthews to help in the first Iraq war . \nRetreating Iraqi troops deliberately spilled 462 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf and set more than 700 oilfield fires . \nAfter the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska , Congress dictated in the 1990 Oil Pollution Act that oil companies be responsible for dealing with major accidents -- including paying for all cleanup -- with oversight by federal agencies . \nThat has pretty much been the model ever since . \nAnd the administration insists that 's exactly what it is doing -- although clearly not everyone agrees . \nAnger grows as the slick spreads and washes ashore into environmentally sensitive marshes and waterways . \nNerves are frayed and finger-pointing in full swing . \nThe administration says it is losing patience with BP PLC 's efforts . \n`` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters outside BP 's headquarters in Houston on Sunday . \nJust what did Salazar mean by `` push them out of the way '' ? \nOfficials have struggled since in explaining . \n`` That 's more of a metaphor , '' the Coast Guard 's Allen said Monday . '' \n` Push BP out of the way ' would raise the question -- replace them with what ? '' \nAllen , responsible for oversight of the spill response , said he 's frustrated too , along with other Americans . \nSalazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano led a Senate delegation to the region Monday . \n`` We are going to stay on this and stay on BP until this gets done and it gets done the right way , '' Napolitano said after flying over the affected area . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , a Republican , has taken swipes at BP and other oil companies involved in the disaster as well as the federal government . \nJindal said he was going to call out members of the Louisiana National Guard to join state wildlife and fisheries agents to supplement a federal response he called inadequate . \nIn particular , Jindal assailed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for failing to sign off on a plan to build a chain of protective sand barriers -- or berms -- off the coast to help block the oil . \n`` We are not waiting for them . \nWe are going to build it '' ourselves , Jindal said . \nU.S. officials say the Corps is nearing a final decision . \nThe spill began April 20 after the Deepwater Horizon rig owned by driller Transocean and leased by BP exploded , killing 11 workers . \nMillions of gallons of oil have spewed from the blown well . \nDoug Suttles , chief operating officer at BP PLC , made the round of network news shows Monday with the same message : `` We are doing everything we can , everything I know . '' \nHe said the energy giant , formerly known as British Petroleum , understands and shares everyone 's frustration . \nBut history is n't encouraging when it comes to underwater ruptures . \nThe last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . \nThe well was owned by Mexico 's state oil company , known as Pemex . \nIt took Pemex and a series of U.S. contractors nearly nine months to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated Mexican and U.S. waters . \nIf patience is necessary , it is n't a particularly forthcoming quality in these tense times . \nEven as strong an Obama ally as Democratic consultant James Carville has been taking shots at the administration . \nA Louisiana native , Carville told CNN the administration was `` risking everything by this ` go along with BP ' strategy . \n... If you let BP handle it ... it 's not going to go away . \nIt is a disaster of the first magnitude and they 've got to go to Plan B.

'' \nBurris and other residents of the Gulf are reporting a slew of symptoms that some biologists say are directly attributable to the chemicals now gushing into the Gulf on a daily basis . \n`` These are the exact symptoms that you could expect from overexposure to crude oil and to the chemicals that are being used out on the cleanup , '' said Riki Ott , a marine toxicologist and activist who worked on the cleanup in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . \nOtt said she had been in contact with several Louisiana fishermen suffering a range of ailments -- `` sore throats , burning headaches , burning eyes , skin rashes , nausea , dizziness '' -- that track with those suffered in the aftermath of the Valdez spill . \nThe dispersants , she says , compound the health risks created by exposure to crude oil . \n`` This is like throwing kerosene on a fire , '' she said . \nBP has sprayed more than 800,000 gallons of dispersant into the Gulf since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20 . \nAt the same time , the oil giant has been enlisting the paid help of Gulf fishermen , whose fleet of hundreds of boats provides them broad access to areas affected by the spill . \nBP 's '' Vessels of Opportunity '' program employs commercial fishermen to hem in surface oil and help clean oil clumping along the coast , creating work for the industry likely to suffer most in the fallout from the oil spill . \nBut critics say the rudimentary safety training given to the fishermen is n't enough . \nWhile BP 's `` key requirements '' include a four-hour training session and a dockside examination by the Coast Guard , the company does not appear to be providing special Hazmat equipment for the ad hoc cleanup crews . \n`` We are not seeing correct personal protection equipment , '' said Clint Guidry , secretary of the Louisiana Shrimp Association , who touted his own experience with toxins from working on oil rigs before he became a fisherman . \nGuidry 's colleague , Acy Cooper , gave a blunt assessment of the situation faced by fishermen patrolling the Gulf 's oily waters . \n`` They 're putting themselves at risk ... -LRB- with -RRB- nothing to protect themselves , '' he said Thursday . \n`` Their eyes are burning , their noses are burning , but all of them need to go -- they need the money . '' \nThe Coast Guard referred inquiries about the health of service members patrolling the Gulf to a unified command team set up by BP . \nCalls and an e-mail message sent to BP seeking comment about their safety measures were not returned . \nSome fishermen aiding in the cleanup are reluctant to speak out against BP in public for fear of losing their temporary jobs , while others are willing to abide the hazards in order to keep earning paychecks from the company , according to fishermen who spoke to FoxNews.com . \n`` The problem is some of the fishermen do n't want to lose the jobs they 've got , '' said George Barisich , head of the United Commercial Fishermen 's Association . \n`` Kind of a Catch-22 situation . '' \nMembers of Congress are now demanding better safety precautions for fishermen surrounding the use of dispersants in order to protect those involved in the cleanup . \nRep. Edward Markey , chairman of the House subcommittee on energy and the environment , criticized BP for ignoring a directive from the Environmental Protection Agency to use less toxic chemicals to help disperse the oil . \n`` The release of hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals into the Gulf of Mexico could be an unprecedented , large and aggressive experiment on our oceans , '' said Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts . '' \n-LRB- T -RRB- he reality is we know almost nothing about the potential harm from the long-term use of any of these chemicals on the marine environment in the Gulf of Mexico , and even less about their potential to enter the food chain and ultimately harm humans , '' Markey said in a written statement Sunday . \nRep. Charlie Melancon , D-La . \n, is urging the White House to establish temporary health clinics in the Gulf to help afflicted workers . \n`` Many residents and volunteers are being exposed to hazardous materials on a daily basis , and some will have to travel hours to get treatment at the nearest health care facility , '' he said in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of Health and Human Services . \n`` It is imperative that temporary health care clinics be established to provide basic health care services in this geographic area . '' \nMelancon argued that BP should foot the bill for the clinics if any are set up , though it remains unclear how many would be necessary or how long they would be required . \n`` What is most frightening about the long-term effects of the oil and the dispersant chemicals is n't what we know , it is what we just do n't know , '' said Markey . \n"}

'' \nEarlier this week , executives of BP , Transoceans and Halliburton blamed each other for the widening environmental catastrophe at back-to-back Senate hearings . \n`` I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter , '' Obama said in brief remarks from the Rose Garden . \n`` The American people could not have been impressed with that display and I certainly was n't . \n... But it is pretty clear that the system failed , and it failed badly . \nAnd for that , there 's enough responsibility to go around . '' \nObama vowed to halt the `` cozy relationship '' between oil companies and federal regulators , as he called for new permitting rules and procedures governing offshore oil drilling . \nObama said he has ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to do a `` top-to-bottom '' reform of the Minerals and Management Service , the agency now under fire for allowing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico without requiring oil companies to provide necessary permits from a separate agency . \n`` For too long , a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agencies that permits them to drill , '' he said . \n`` Seems as if permits were too often issued based on a little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies . '' \n`` That can not and will not happen anymore , '' he said , adding that the government `` will trust , but we will verify . '' \nSalazar has called for a plan to split the agency in two . \nOne agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . \nThat would separate the agency 's two core responsibilities , which critics say are diametrically opposed -- making money off the industry , while also cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . \nEnvironmental groups have criticized the agency for giving the Deepwater Horizon a `` categorical exclusion '' from a environmental impact study of the operation or a serious assessment of its inherent risks . \nThat exemption was granted 11 days before the underwater exploratory rig exploded . \nThe agency , which is part of the Interior Department , has also given a light regulatory touch to other offshore projects . \nObama also said that no one knows exactly how much oil is leaking because human inspectors can not reach the mile-deep well head . \nHe said he would not rest until the leak is stopped , the oil is contained and cleaned up , and people of the Gulf region resume normal lives . \nFox News ' Major Garrett contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "1443", "time": "2010-05-14", "text": "There is overwhelming agreement that something went terribly wrong with America 's current offshore drilling and leasing process in the wake of the April 20 oil spill off the coast of Louisiana . \nOn Friday , President Obama bluntly said of the situation , `` the system failed , and it failed badly . '' \nEarlier this week oil companies who do business in the Gulf of Mexico endured a sound thrashing from Senators on Capitol Hill seeking answers for what happened . \nThe motive behind these hearings , which the president deemed a `` ridiculous spectacle , '' was not nefarious . \nWe should discover exactly what happened and what we can do in the future to make sure it 's never repeated . \nWe should demand an independent investigation , as was done after the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , to determine what went wrong and how we can improve drilling in the future . \nIn fact , after Exxon Valdez , Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act which created a new oil spill trust fund to guarantee payment for future spills and smarter contingency planning for responding to future accidents . \nAn investigation today may yield a need to utilize new safety standards and update OPA . \nAfter all , available technology today is dramatically different than what it was two decades ago . \nBut amidst this push for answers we can not ignore the reality of America 's energy needs . \nMany lawmakers have lost sight of this and are using the Gulf oil spill as political ammunition to torpedo offshore drilling . \nSenator Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- \nsaid any new energy bill with expanded offshore drilling provisions would be `` dead on arrival '' in the wake of the Gulf spill . \nSenator Robert Menendez -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- likened offshore drilling to `` Russian roulette '' \\* for America 's beaches . \nSenator Ben Cardin -LRB- D-Md . -RRB- \nasked President Obama , `` in light of the devastating BP oil spill , '' to remove the Atlantic coast from consideration for offshore drilling . \nTheir concerns for oil development safety are valid , but their solution is unsound . \nA recent letter from those Senators to President Obama noted that `` the costs and benefits of offshore drilling need to be reassessed . '' \nSuch an assessment is necessary , although the Senators wo n't like the results . \nConsider : According to the Minerals Management Service , which oversees offshore drilling in the U.S. , the Gulf 's 3,500 platforms produce 1.2 million barrels of oil per day , or 30 % of all domestic production , and support more than 35,000 jobs . \nPut another way , offshore drilling in the Gulf employs the equivalent of a small U.S. city and keeps us from sending an astounding $ 35 billion every year to countries like Venezuela and Iran . \nThe current spill will have enormous environmental impacts , but would halting offshore drilling fix that ? \nThe National Academy of Sciences found that tankers carrying oil from other countries account for four times as much spillage as offshore platforms , countries on whom we 'd have to depend more for our oil . \nStopping drilling thus puts the environment in more jeopardy , not less . \nIt 's also important to note that while many advocates for a `` clean energy future '' want to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through a panacea of windmills and solar panels , their solution does not work . \nWind and solar provide electricity , not transportation fuel , and oil provides only about 1 % of America 's electricity . \nSo what 's the best way to fix the problem ? \nAfter the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957 and America saw it was losing the space race , the Defense Department created what would become the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -LRB- DARPA -RRB- to guarantee that America would not lose its technological superiority . \nGiven that where we get our energy constitutes an economic and national security issue , we should tackle this problem in a similar manner by researching and developing the safest drilling technology in the world . \nThis is how America responds to national crises . \nWe tackle the problem head on , fix it , and move forward . \nPresident Obama articulated this perfectly when he acknowledged drilling is part of our energy strategy , and that `` our job to make sure this kind of mess does n't happen again . '' \nWe do not , and should not , stop in our tracks , litigate , and move backward as some in Congress are proposing . \nAffordable and reliable energy are requirements for American prosperity , not luxuries that can be abandoned . \nWe should push for safer energy , not zero energy . \nSteve Everley is the manager of policy research at American Solutions . \nLearn more about the organization 's Freedom of Information Act request at www.AmericanSolutions.com . \nFox Forum is on Twitter . \n"}

{"id": "1676", "time": "2010-12-03", "text": "WASHINGTON -- BP is mounting a new challenge to the U.S. government 's estimates of how much oil flowed from the runaway well deep below the Gulf of Mexico , an argument that could reduce by billions of dollars the federal pollution fines it faces for the largest offshore oil spill in history . \nBP 's lawyers are arguing that the government overstated the spill by 20 to 50 percent , staffers working for the presidential oil spill commission said Friday . \nIn a 10-page document obtained by The Associated Press , BP says the government 's spill estimate of 206 million gallons is `` overstated by a significant amount '' and the company said any consensus around that number is premature and inaccurate . \nThe company submitted the document to the commission , the Justice Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \n`` They rely on incomplete or inaccurate information , rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated , and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged , '' BP wrote . \n`` BP fully intends to present its own estimate as soon as the information is available to get the science right . '' \nIn a statement Friday , the company said the government 's estimates failed to account for equipment that could obstruct the flow of oil and gas , such as the blowout preventer , making its numbers `` highly unreliable . '' \nBP 's request could save it as much as $ 10.5 billion or as little as $ 1.1 billion , depending on factors such as whether the government concludes that BP acted negligently . \nFor context , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's entire federal budget for 2010 was $ 10.3 billion . \nPresident Barack Obama has said he wants Congress to set aside some of the money BP pays for fines for the Gulf 's coastal restoration . \nLouisiana lawmakers are pushing legislation that would require at least 80 percent of the civil and criminal penalties charged to BP , and possibly other companies , to be returned to the Gulf Coast . \nWilliam K. Reilly , co-chairman of the presidential commission , expressed amazement at BP 's case Friday . \nReilly headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush . \n`` They are going to argue that it is 50 percent less '' than the government 's total ? \nUnder the Clean Water Act , the oil giant -- which owned and operated the well -- faces fines of up to $ 1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled . \nIf BP were found to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct , the fine could be up to $ 4,300 per barrel . \nThat means that based on the government 's estimate of 206 million gallons , BP could face civil fines alone of between $ 5.4 billion and $ 21.1 billion . \n`` They are going to argue it was less , '' said Priya Aiyar , the commission 's deputy chief counsel . \n`` BP has not offered its own numbers yet , but BP has told us that it thinks the government 's numbers are too high and thinks the actual flow rate can be actually 20 to 50 percent lower . '' \nRep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . \n, a member of the House energy panel that is investigating the spill , said in a statement Friday to the AP that BP has done whatever it could to avoid revealing the true flow rate of the spill . \n`` With billions of dollars at stake , it is no surprise that they are now litigating the very numbers which they sought to impede , '' Markey said . \n`` The government engaged independent scientists and multiple techniques to arrive at their estimate . \nAdditional independent peer-reviewed studies have corroborated their estimate . \nBP has a high bar to meet to overturn this estimate . '' \nBP 's argument could be bolstered by the federal government 's missteps in coming up with a final estimate for the spill 's volume . \nThe Obama administration has offered nearly 10 estimates of how much oil flowed from the BP well , coming up with a refined conclusion late last month of 206 million gallons , which is likely its last . \nInternal documents released late Friday under the Freedom of Information Act show that the White House was intimately involved in deciding how scientific information was portrayed to the public , particularly when it came to the August 4 release of a document that showed where the spilled oil had gone . \nThe five-page report , which was touted by Carol Browner , the president 's energy adviser , on morning talk shows and at White House press briefing showed that half the oil was gone -- either from evaporation , burning , skimming or recovery at the well head . \nThe 3,500 pages of documents reveal that the administration wanted the oil budget to show its efforts to respond to the disaster were working , despite objections from top EPA officials , including Administrator Lisa Jackson , over how some of the data was presented . \nAn earlier version of the press release issued with the paper said that 33 percent of the oil released was captured or mitigated by recovery efforts . \nA final version , changed hours before its release , said `` the vast majority '' of the spilled oil was addressed by recovery efforts or had naturally dispersed or evaporated . \nThat morning , Browner appeared on national television saying that an initial assessment by federal scientists showed `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . '' \nIn an e-mail sent later that morning addressed to Browner 's assistant , Heather Zichal , NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco finds fault with the White House 's interpretation of the report 's numbers and attribution of the report solely to NOAA . \nThe report was drafted by several agencies . \n`` I 'm concerned to hear the oil budget report is being portrayed as saying that 75 percent of the oil is gone and that this is a NOAA report , '' Lubchenco writes . \n`` Please help make sure that both errors are corrected . '' \nThe White House acknowledged Browner had misspoke . \n"}

$ 12 million each to the states of Alabama and Mississippi ; $ 3 million to Florida ; and $ 10 million to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . \nEven though the oil stopped flowing in July and the BP well was finally killed this month , some officials say the toll on mental health may get worse as the financial strains of summer persist into the fall . \n`` It 's like a virus that 's spreading , '' said Tonya Fistein , one of four counselors hired by AltaPointe Health Systems specifically to help people deal emotionally with the spill in Bayou La Batre , a tiny Alabama fishing community hard hit by the disaster . \nAltaPointe 's clinic is seeing twice as many new patients as in 2009 , an increase it blames on the spill . \nIn Gulfport , Miss. , 42 percent of the patients surveyed at the Gulf Coast Mental Health Center said they were sad or depressed because of the spill . \nSteve Barrileaux , a psychologist at the Gulfport center , said some of the problems leading to mental health issues are obvious , like the loss of work by a person who rented chairs on the beach . \nOthers are more subtle . \nMany people are deeply worried about the environment , for instance , or lament the lost moments they would have spent fishing recreationally with loved ones . \nOthers are still afraid to eat seafood , even on the coast where livelihoods depend on it . \n`` What 's scary is the long-term damage that can be done , and we just do n't know about that , '' Barrileaux said . \nChanthy Prak frets constantly about how to make ends meet in the post-spill world . \nPrak worked in crab houses around Bayou La Batre before the oil hit . \nShe and her husband , another seafood worker displaced by the spill , have received only $ 5,000 in claims payments since May to support them and their seven children . \nThere 's money going out but no money coming in , '' said the Cambodia native . \nIn some areas , higher rates of mental problems appear to have little to do with the oil . \nAt Lakeview Center , which provides mental health services in Pensacola , Fla. , calls have increased to a crisis intervention line compared to 2009 , but relatively few people have mentioned the oil spill as the reason they need help , said spokeswoman Karen Smith . \nPsychologists believe the uptick is most likely linked to the recession , she said . \nMore oil came ashore just to the west of Pensacola in Baldwin County , Ala. , however , and a survey conducted for the state by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found significant mental health problems that people blamed on the spill . \nTwenty-three percent of households in the area reported having at least one person who blamed sleep troubles on the spill , and 11 percent had at least one person with appetite loss . \nPerhaps most tellingly , 32 percent reported a decrease in income linked to the oil spill , which could lead to additional strain , said Dr. Charles Woernle , the state epidemiologist with the Alabama Department of Public Health . \nOfficials along the Gulf Coast worry that many of the hardest-hit groups -- shrimpers , Asian seafood workers and low-wage tourism employees -- wo n't seek help for mental problems because of cultural taboos . \nAt AltaPointe , officials hope to use a share of the BP money to pay for additional oil-spill counselors . \nTejuania Nelson , who runs a day-care center in fishing-dependent Grand Bay , Ala. , said preschoolers whose parents were left jobless because of the spill are lashing out in unsettling ways . \n`` They 're throwing desks , kicking chairs , '' she said . \n`` It 's sad . \nWith this , people do not have hope . \nThey can not see a better time .

Thad Allen , the federal government 's point man on the disaster , said Sunday that BP 's well `` is effectively dead '' and posed no further threat to the Gulf . \nAllen said a pressure test to ensure the cement plug would hold was completed at 5:54 a.m. CDT -LRB- 10:54 GMT -RRB- . \nPresident Obama commended Allen and other federal officials Sunday for achieving an `` important milestone , '' and said the U.S. remains committed to restoring the environment in the Gulf . \n`` While we have seen a diminished need for our massive response that encompassed more than 40,000 people , 7,000 vessels and the coordination of dozens of federal , state and local agencies and other partners , we also remain committed to doing everything possible to make sure the Gulf Coast recovers fully from this disaster , '' Obama said in a statement . \n`` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them . '' \nThe gusher was contained in mid-July after a temporary cap was successfully fitted atop the well . \nMud and cement were later pushed down through the top of the well , allowing the cap to be removed . \nBut the well could not be declared dead until a relief well was drilled so that the ruptured well could be sealed from the bottom , ensuring it never causes a problem again . \nThe relief well intersected the blown-out well Thursday , and crews started pumping in the cement on Friday . \nThe April 20 blast killed 11 workers , and 206 million gallons -LRB- 780 million liters -RRB- of oil spewed . \nThe disaster caused an environmental and economic nightmare for people who live , work and play along hundreds of miles of Gulf shoreline from Florida to Texas . \nIt also spurred civil and criminal investigations , cost gaffe-prone BP chief Tony Hayward his job , and brought increased governmental scrutiny of the oil and gas industry , including a costly moratorium on deep water offshore drilling that is still in place . \nGulf residents will be feeling the pain for years to come . \nThere is still plenty of oil in the water , and some continues to wash up on shore . \nMany people are still struggling to make ends meet with some waters still closed to fishing . \nShrimpers who are allowed to fish are finding it difficult to sell their catch because of the perception -- largely from people outside the region -- that the seafood is not safe to eat . \nTourism along the Gulf has taken a hit . \nThe disaster also has taken a toll on the once mighty oil giant BP PLC. . \nThe British company 's stock price took a nosedive after the explosion , though it has recovered somewhat . \nIts image as a steward of the environment was stained and its stated commitment to safety was challenged . \nOwners of BP-branded gas stations in the U.S. were hit with lost sales , as customers protested at the pump . \nAnd on the financial side : BP has already shelled out more than $ 8 billion in cleanup costs and promised to set aside another $ 20 billion for a victims compensation fund . \nThe company could face tens of billions of dollars more in government fines and legal costs from hundreds of pending lawsuits . \nBP took some of the blame for the Gulf oil disaster in an internal report issued this month , acknowledging among other things that its workers misinterpreted a key pressure test of the well . \nBut in a possible preview of its legal strategy , it also pointed the finger at its partners on the doomed rig . \nBP was a majority owner of the well that blew out , and it was leasing the rig that exploded from owner Transocean Ltd. . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}

'' \nAmong those who came to check out the ideas was Buck Lee , chairman of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , which oversees Pensacola Beach . \n`` Whoever invents the magic dust is going to be a millionaire , '' Lee said , as he handled phone call after phone call from people concerned about the oil-covered beach . \nJeff Powell demonstrated a tar-ball rake . \nPowell 's Pensacola-based company , Ellis Trap and Cage Manufacturing , has long sold crab and bait-fish traps and sand flea rakes . \nThe oil spill has hit his company hard , so Powell said he came up with another idea -- a rake that traps tar balls and filters out the sand . \nIn about 30 minutes he raked his plot of sand and left a clean section . \nPeat moss is Canadian John Green 's answer . \nHe demonstrated Sphagsorb , a microbe-enhanced peat moss . \nThe product has worked in Canadian oil spills . \nTen pounds of the Sphagsorb collects about 40 pounds of oil and tar , he said , as he spread the stuff over his plot . \nHe glommed up a large wad of tar with his gloved hand to show how it caused the tar to stick together and made it easier to remove . \nOther ideas included spraying microbes onto the sand with containers that looked like bug sprayers , and mesh matting that could be removed from the sand after the tar washes on shore . \nAfter an hour , the small section of beach in front of the public walkway where the inventors demonstrated their ideas looked much cleaner than when they started . \nBut evaluators were mum about whether they would choose any of the ideas or how quickly the public might see them in action . \n"}
{"id": "1228", "time": "2010-07-02", "text": "A 23-kiloton nuclear bomb detonated on 18 April , 1953 , at a Nevada test site released this mushroom cloud . \n`` A nuclear explosion over the leak , '' he says nonchalantly puffing a cigarette as he sits in a conference room at the Institute of Strategic Stability , where he is a director . \n`` I do n't know what BP is waiting for , they are wasting their time . \nOnly about 10 kilotons of nuclear explosion capacity and the problem is solved . '' \nA nuclear fix to the leaking well has been touted online and in the occasional newspaper op-ed for weeks now . \nWashington has repeatedly dismissed the idea and BP execs say they are not considering an explosion -- nuclear or otherwise . \nBut as a series of efforts to plug the 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing from the sea floor have failed , talk of an extreme solution refuses to die . \nFor some , blasting the problem seems the most logical answer in the world . \nMikhailov has had a distinguished career in the nuclear field , helping to close a Soviet Union program that used nuclear explosions to seal gas leaks . \nOrdinarily he 's an opponent of nuclear blasts , but he says an underwater explosion in the Gulf of Mexico would not be harmful and could cost no more than $ 10 million . \nThat compares with the $ 2.35 billion BP has paid out in cleanup and compensation costs so far . \n`` This option is worth the money , '' he says . \nAnd it 's not just Soviet boffins . \nMilo Nordyke , one of the masterminds behind U.S research into peaceful nuclear energy in the 1960s and '70s says a nuclear explosion is a logical last-resort solution for BP and the government . \nMatthew Simmons , a former energy adviser to U.S. President George W. Bush and the founder of energy investment-banking firm Simmons & Company International , is another calling for the nuclear option . \nEven former U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced support for the idea of an explosion to stem the flow of oil , albeit one using conventional materials rather than nukes . \n`` Unless we send the Navy down deep to blow up the well and cover the leak with piles and piles and piles of rock and debris , which may become necessary ... unless we are going to do that , we are dependent on the technical expertise of these people from BP , '' Clinton told the Fortune\\/Time\\/CNN Global Forum in South Africa on June 29 . \nClinton was picking up on an idea mooted by Christopher Brownfield in June . \nBrownfield is a one-time nuclear submarine officer , a veteran of the Iraq war -LRB- he volunteered in 2006 -RRB- and now a nuclear policy researcher at Columbia University . \nHe is also one of a number of scientists whose theories rely not on nuclear bombs -- he did toy with that thought for a while -- but on conventional explosives that would implode the well and , if not completely plug it with crushed rock , at least bring the flow of oil under control . \n`` It 's kind of like stepping on a garden hose to kink it , '' Brownfield says . \n`` You may not cut off the flow entirely but it would greatly reduce the flow . '' \nUsing nuclear blasts for peaceful ends was a key plank of Cold War policy in both the United States and the Soviet Union . \nIn the middle of last century , both countries were motivated by a desire to soften the image of the era 's weapon of choice . \nWashington had big plans to use peaceful nuclear explosions to build an additional Panama Canal , carve a path for an inter-state highway through mountains in the Mojave Desert and connect underwater aquifers in Arizona . \nBut the experimental plans were dropped as authorities learned more about the ecological dangers of surface explosions . \nThe Soviet program , known as Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy , was launched in 1958 . \nThe project saw 124 nuclear explosions for such tasks as digging canals and reservoirs , creating underground storage caverns for natural gas and toxic waste , exploiting oil and gas deposits and sealing gas leaks . \nIt was finally mothballed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 . \nThe Soviets first used a nuclear blast to seal a gas leak in 1966 . \nUrtabulak , one of its prized gas-fields in Uzbekistan , had caught fire and raged for three years . \nDesperate to save the cherished reserves , Yefim Slavsky , then Minister of Light Industry , ordered nuclear engineers to use the most powerful weapon in their arsenal . \n`` The Minister said , ` Do it . \nExplode it , ' '' recalls Albert Vasilyev , a young engineer and a rising star in the project who now teaches at the Lenin Technical Institute in Moscow . \nVasilyev remembers the technology behind the program with obvious pride . \n`` The explosion takes place deep underground , '' he says . \n`` We pinch the pipe , break it and the pipe collapses . '' \nAccording to Vasilyev , the blast at Urtabulak sealed the well shut leaving only an empty crater . \nIn all , the Soviets detonated five nuclear devices to seal off runaway gas wells -- succeeding three or four times , depending on who you talk to . \n`` It worked quite well for them , '' says Nordyke , who authored a detailed account of Soviet explosions in a 2000 paper . \n`` There is no reason to think it would n't be fine -LRB- for the United States -RRB- . '' \nBut not everything went smoothly . \nVasilyev admits the program `` had two misfires '' . \nThe final blast in 1979 was conducted near the Ukrainian city of Kharkov . \n`` The closest houses were just about 400 meters away , '' Vasilyev recalls . \n`` So this was ordered to be the weakest of the explosions . \nEven the buildings and the street lamps survived . '' \nUnfortunately , the low capacity of the device failed to seal the well and the gas resurfaced . \nAlexander Koldobsky , a fellow nuclear physicist from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute , insists the peaceful nuclear explosions were safe . \nThe people who worked on the program `` were brilliant professionals '' , he says . \n`` They had a culture of safety , which did not accept the word ` maybe ' , but only accepted the words ` obligation ' and ` instruction . ' \nAny derivation from these in nuclear technologies is a crime . '' \nStill , he concedes , `` there were different scenarios of what happened after an explosion . '' \nAt his first blast in a Turkmen gas field in 1972 , `` the stench was unbearable , '' he says . \n`` And the wind was blowing toward a nearby town .

Mary Landry said the leak was a new discovery but could have begun when the rig sank on Thursday , two days after the initial explosion . \n`` We thought what we were dealing with as of yesterday was a surface residual -LRB- oil -RRB- from the mobile offshore drilling unit , '' Landry said . \n`` In addition to that is oil emanating from the well . \nIt is a big change from yesterday ... This is a very serious spill , absolutely . '' \nCoast Guard and company officials estimate that as much as 1,000 barrels -- or 42,000 gallons -- of oil is leaking each day after studying information from remotely operated vehicles and the size of the oil slick surrounding the blast site . \nThe rainbow-colored sheen of oil stretched 20 miles by 20 miles on Saturday -- about 25 times larger than it appeared to be a day earlier , Landry said . \nBy comparison , Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nBP PLC , which leased the rig and is taking the lead in the cleanup , and the government have been using the remotely operated vehicles to try to stop the leak by closing valves on the well deep underwater . \nIf that does n't work , the company could drill what 's called an intervention well to control the oil flow . \nBut the intervention drilling could take months . \n`` Over the next several days , we should determine which method is the best one to follow , '' said Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production . \n`` A huge number of engineers from ourselves , working with -LRB- the government -RRB- and across the industry are putting together the best technology and know-how to solve this problem . '' \nComplicating efforts to stop the leak is well head 's depth at 5,000 feet underwater , said Lars Herbst , the regional director for the Minerals Management Service . \nLeaks have been fixed at similar depths before , but the process is difficult , he said . \nThe bad weather rolled in Friday , bringing with it strong wind , clouds and rain that interrupted efforts to contain the oil spill . \nCoast Guard Petty Officer John Edwards said he was uncertain when weather conditions would improve enough for the cleanup to resume . \nSo far , crews have retrieved about 1,052 barrels of oily water , he said . \nThe sunken rig may have as much as 700,000 gallons of diesel on board , and an undetermined amount of oil has spilled from the rig itself . \nSuttles said the rig was `` intact and secure '' on the seabed about 1,300 feet from the well site . \nBP said it has activated an extensive oil spill response , including the remotely operated vehicles , 700 workers , four airplanes and 32 vessels to mop up the spill . \nThe Marine Spill Response Corp. , an energy industry cleanup consortium , also brought equipment . \nThe 11 missing workers came from Texas , Louisiana and Mississippi . \nNeither the Coast Guard nor their employers have released their names , though several of their families have come forward . \nKarl Kleppinger Sr. , whose 38-year-old son , Karl , was one of the missing workers , said he does n't blame the Coast Guard for calling off the search . \n`` Given the magnitude of the explosion and the fire , I do n't see where you would be able to find anything , '' said Kleppinger , of Zachary , La. . \nThe other 115 crew members made it off the platform ; several were hurt but only one remained hospitalized . \nThe most seriously injured worker was expected to be released within about 10 days . \nFederal officials had already been working on new safety rules for offshore drilling before Tuesday 's blast . \nThe U.S. Minerals and Management Service is developing regulations aimed at preventing human error , which it identified as a factor in many of the more than 1,400 offshore oil drilling accidents between 2001 and 2007 . \nAn MMS review published last year found 41 deaths and 302 injuries during that period . \nThe cause of Tuesday 's blast has n't been determined . \nThe Deepwater Horizon was the site of a 2005 fire found to have been caused by human error . \nAn MMS investigation determined that a crane operator on the rig had become distracted while refueling the crane , allowing diesel fuel to overflow . \nRecords show the fire was quickly contained , but caused $ 60,000 in damage to the crane . \nEnvironmentalists said the rig explosion and oil spill should push the nation to develop new energy sources . \n`` This should be a wake-up call , '' said David Helvarg , the president of the Blue Frontier Campaign , a marine conservation group , and author of `` Rescue Warriors : The U.S. Coast Guard , America 's Forgotten Heroes . '' \n`` I would rather risk a ` wind spill ' than an oil spill offshore , '' he said , ruefully pointing out that the source of wind-powered energy ca n't sully the environment . \n"}

'' \nRudy Toler , 30 , a shrimper and oysterman from Gulfport , Miss. , called the payment disgusting . \n`` It makes me sick , '' said Toler , a married father of four who has n't received a dime from the fund . \n`` It 's just criminal . '' \nEarly on , he filed a claim for losses of about $ 140,000 for the six months he could n't work through the summer . \nThe claims facility tells him his paperwork is under review again , but in the meantime , Toler is struggling to pay his bills and feed his family . \n`` I 'm doing the best I can , '' he said Monday . \n`` Every day is a struggle . '' \nMayor Tony Kennon of Orange Beach , Ala. , a tourist town hit particularly hard by the oil spill , said the early settlement payment `` reeks of favoritism . '' \n`` It stinks , '' Kennon said Monday . \n`` It 's exactly what we 've been screaming about . \nThere 's not an independent entity . \nThere 's no oversight . '' \nFeinberg has faced repeated criticism from lawmakers , plaintiffs attorneys and claimants who complain about a lack of transparency and independence from BP , as well as claims being shortchanged and paid too slowly , or not at all . \nHis law firm had been receiving $ 850,000 a month from BP for its work . \nFeinberg is currently negotiating with BP over a new payment structure to run the fund through August 2013 . \nAny money left over from the $ 20 billion is expected to be returned to BP . \nFeinberg has repeatedly promised fairness and transparency . \nHe calls the program a success and notes it has already paid out more than $ 3.3 billion to some 251,000 claimants . \nHowever , roughly half of the 484,000 claims filed have been denied because of ineligibility or lack of documentation , meaning they got nothing , like Toler . \nAnd while there is an appeals process through the U.S. Coast Guard for disgruntled claimants , the agency has consistently sided with the facility . \nFeinberg told AP that the Coast Guard had processed 264 out of 507 appeals filed and in every case has agreed with the decisions by the claims fund . \nThe program first allowed claimants to file for emergency six-month payments to keep them afloat , but many of those claims were denied . \nThose that were n't often were paid fractions of what they claimed they lost . \nThe process now allows for three options . \nSpill victims can file for a quick cash one-time payment of $ 5,000 for individuals and $ 25,000 for businesses . \nMore than 80,000 claimants have filed and been paid in that category , giving up their right to anymore money or to sue BP or any other responsible company . \nClaimants may also opt for a final settlement , but also would have to give up the right to sue . \nResidents and business owners who are n't ready to make that decision could instead file for interim quarterly payments through August 2013 , provided they can show proof of continued losses . \n"}

Bobby Jindal during a speech in Houma , La. , where he spoke out against the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , saying it would kill thousands of Louisiana jobs . \n-LRB- AP -RRB- The Obama administration is lifting the moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico -- as long as oil companies comply with several new rules that opponents of the ban say could hamper recovery of the Gulf Coast economy six months after the BP oil spill . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar announced a lifting of the moratorium on Tuesday after reviewing progress of safety reforms , availability of spill response resources , improved blowout containment capabilities and a report by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation , and Enforcement -LRB- BOEM -RRB- Director Michael R. Bromwich . \nBromwich is head of the office that succeeded the Minerals Management Agency blamed with not doing enough inspections on oil platforms like the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded on April 20 and created the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . \n`` In light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , we must continue to take a cautious approach when it comes to deepwater drilling and remain aggressive in raising the bar for the oil and gas industry 's safety and environmental practices , '' said Salazar , who announced the moratorium on July 12 . \n`` The oil and gas industry will be operating under tighter rules , stronger oversight , and in a regulatory environment that will remain dynamic as we continue to build on the reforms we have already implemented , '' he said . \nEven though the ban is being lifted immediately , it will likely take a couple weeks for new permitting to be approved . \nIn addition to new safety rules , the BOEM will conduct inspections and require certifications from oil rig operators about operator compliance as well as mechanisms to contain failures of the blowout preventers -LRB- BOPs -RRB- designed to shut down a well that has an accident . \nThe removal of the ban also does not mean that U.S. companies will operate at the pace and levels they did before the accident 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nA de facto moratorium has also been in place on shallow-water drilling , with only four permits for such work approved by the federal government since the explosion , as contrasted with an average of 14 such permits having been approved per month for the 11 months that led up to the explosion . \nThis slow-walking approach to drilling has been blamed for uncertainty in not only the drilling industry but other industries where the current regulatory and recession-era climate has made it difficult to hire or plan for the future . \nSen. David Vitter , R-La . \n, called on Salazar to expedite distribution of drilling permits , saying a new study by Southern Methodist University shows that the slowdown in new shallow-water permits has placed nearly 40,000 jobs in jeopardy . \n`` I guess this is movement in the right direction , but it 's painfully slow . \nIt 's clear that President Obama is going to preside over a continuing de facto moratorium for months or years , with new drilling held back to a fraction of previous levels . \nI 'll keep fighting until real drilling happens and jobs are actually created , '' Vitter said . \nSen. Mary L. Landrieu , D-La . \n, agreed with Vitter in spirit , adding that she is not going to remove a hold she put on Jacob Lew , President Obama 's nominee to be director of the Office of Management and Budget , whom Landrieu is preventing from joining the administration until the Gulf of Mexico oil industry is back to work . \n`` I will take this time to look closely at how BOEM is handling the issuing of permits and whether or not drilling activity in both shallow and deep water is resuming . \nWhen Congress reconvenes for the lame-duck session next month , I will have had several weeks to evaluate if today 's lifting of the moratorium is actually putting people back to work , '' she said . \nNonetheless , supporters of the moratorium and the additional rules said they were pleased with the outcome but wanted additional authority for an independent commission to question BP about the spill . \n`` Because there was a suspension of belief on the part of the oil industry that an accident like this could ever happen , a suspension of drilling was necessary to bring those companies back to reality , '' said House Environment and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n`` Much more is left to be done in the wake of the BP spill . \nSenate Republicans continue to block subpoena power for the independent commission investigating the spill , and the Senate has still yet to take up the spill safety legislation that the House approved last summer , '' he added . \nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that the new rules are not aimed at chasing away companies from future business nor were politics a consideration . \nHe expressed disappointment that Landrieu is holding up Lew 's nomination in the aftermath of the accident . \n`` Our feeling is that the nomination is n't connected to the moratorium . \nHe did n't have any connection to issuing -LRB- the moratorium -RRB- , '' Gibbs said . \n`` I hope that as we work through this process the senator will judge Jack Lew on the merits of being a director , not on politics .

{"id": "1057", "time": "2010-08-19", "text": "July 31 : Oiled marsh grass is seen in Barataria Bay on the coast of Louisiana . \nAs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that most surface oil in the Gulf of Mexico has degraded to a thin sheen and the incoming BP PLC CEO calls for a `` scaleback '' in cleanup efforts , local officials on the Louisiana coast say they are still finding new patches of heavy oil -LRB- AP -RRB- . \nA government report that concludes only 10 percent of oil from the Gulf of Mexico gusher was burned or skimmed does not earn BP a `` passing grade , '' the Democratic chairman of a House subcommittee said Thursday . \nRep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n, chairman of a House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment , said in a hearing Thursday that the 10 percent that BP was able to remove from the ocean by burning or skimming is no better than recovery efforts 21 years ago during the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . \n`` It seems to me that BP 's oil recovery effort comes in on the low effort of what was achievable 21 years ago , '' Markey said , pointing to both a Government Accountability Office and Office of Technology Assessment report that found -- given technologies available at the time of the 1989 accident -- only 10 to 15 percent of the spilled oil could be recovered . . \n`` In my mind , that is not a passing grade , only 10 percent of the 4.1 million barrels actually having been recovered , '' he continued . \n`` I think we all saw this coming ... I think it 's important that , even using a 21-year-old grading system , that BP has done a very poor job in cleaning up the Gulf . '' \nMarkey convened Thursday 's hearing to press government officials on the state of the BP oil cleanup . \nBill Lehr , a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , testified that one quarter of the gusher was recovered , burned or skimmed from the beaches or in the Gulf . \nAnother quarter evaporated or degraded , one quarter ended up `` dispersed '' in the water column and one quarter is still floating around . \nAnother 800,000 barrels of oil were pulled directly from the well to ships , explaining the difference between the 4.1 million barrels determined to have gone into the Gulf water and 4.9 million barrels that gushed out of the well overall during the spill that lasted three and half months . \nNOAA released a five-page report Aug. 4 that claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . \nThe remaining 25 percent , the report said , consists of residual oil that is buried in sediments and sand in the water or along the shoreline . \nThe government report , however , is undermined by scientific data that found an oil plume at least 22 miles long , 3,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico -- suggesting that the tens of millions of gallons of oil that leaked from a broken BP well could persist far longer than expected . \nWhether the plume 's existence poses a significant threat to the Gulf ecosystem and sea life is not yet clear , the researchers say . \n`` We do n't know how toxic it is , '' said Christopher Reddy , a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute -LRB- WHOI -RRB- marine geochemist and oil spill expert and one of the authors of a study conducted from observations made in late June . \nResearchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents were quick to disagree with the NOAA report , calling it `` misleading if not totally inaccurate . '' \nBut Reddy said he ca n't say `` how much oil is in the plume '' so the information does n't necessarily contradict the government report . \nThe Obama administration used the Aug. 4 report to claim that 75 percent of the spill is gone and only one-quarter of the oil that began gushing after the April 20 accident remains in the water . \nRep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . \n, a chief critic of the White House , called those claims irresponsible since NOAA has n't completed its evaluation . \n`` This is yet another in a long line of examples where the White House 's preoccupation with the public relations of the oil spill has superseded the realities on the ground , '' Issa , who is ranking Republican on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee , said in a statement . \n`` It is deeply troubling that White House officials apparently preempted the completion and review of a scientific study on the oil spill by NOAA scientists in order to tout conclusions that many experts believe may be deeply flawed , '' he added . \nOn Thursday , Markey told Lehr that his testimony gave a `` false sense of confidence '' on the cleanup and long-term consequences to the environment . \n`` People want to believe that everything is OK and I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' he said . \nLehr did not disclose in his testimony the methodology used to determine how much oil was released into the Gulf . \nHe said his office will release the formulas and methodologies in about two months , after it has determined that its figures are correct . \n`` You should not have released it until you knew it was right . \nIf you are not confident that it is right then it should not have been released because it basically sent a signal with regard to how much of the problem remains , '' he said . \n`` The public has a right to know right now what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBecause if your numbers are wrong , it could be too late , '' he added . \n`` You do n't want to give us all of the data . \nBut you 've given us conclusions .

'' \nThe existence of the plume , which was concretely pinned to the blown-out well , seems to contradict a five-page report released August 4 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , which claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . \nThe remaining 25 % consists of residual oil buried in sediments and sand , the report claimed . \nResearchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents immediately disagreed with the report , calling it `` misleading if not totally inaccurate . '' \nYet despite the seeming contrast between the government report and their new findings , Reddy refused to describe this new evidence as a contradiction . \n`` What the government has done and other universities are trying to do is constrain a budget , '' he said , arguing that it was too early to determine whether this finding was a smoking gun or just `` a penny in a very big checking account . '' \n`` I ca n't tell you how much oil is in the plume , '' he noted , so it does n't contradict the government 's report that only 26 % of the leak remains . \nAnd the picture will change as more chemical analysis is done , Reddy pointed out . \nBut one thing is clear : There 's definitely still oil down there . \n`` We 've shown conclusively not only that a plume exists , but also defined its origin and near-field structure , '' said Richard Camilli the other lead researcher from WHOI , of the 1.2 mile wide , 650 foot high plume . \nThe team 's observations were made during a June 19-28 scientific cruise aboard the National Science Foundation owned ship Endeavor . \nIt was halted by the onset of hurricane Alex. Since measurements ended nearly two months ago , the scientists admit they are unsure what has happened to the plume . \n`` We do n't know where these hydrocarbons are . \nWe saw them in June , '' Reddy said . \nThe findings were based on two technologies : an autonomous underwater vehicle called Sentry and an underwater mass spectrometer . \nBy integrating the two , researchers were able to detect even minute quantities of petroleum as well as other chemical compounds , something previous investigators were unable to achieve using conventional profiling . \nThey discovered consistent concentrations of hydrocarbons throughout the plume . \nGiven the makeup and concentration -- in excess of 50 micrograms per liter -- the researchers concluded that the plume could not have developed from natural seepage . \nFurther analysis of the samples will provide a clearer picture of the plume structure as well as a better estimate of the total amount of spilled oil . \nIt will also give insight into what sort of threat the plume poses . \n`` The plume is not pure oil , '' Camilli said . \n`` But there are oil compounds in there . '' \nIt may require a few months of laboratory analysis and validation , Reddy said . \nBoth researchers were surprised by the size and concentration of the plume . \n`` -LRB- The plume -RRB- is persisting for longer periods than we would have expected , '' Camilli said . \n`` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily biodegraded . '' \nThe underwater oil was also remarkably stable , hanging at around 3,000 feet beneath the surface . \n`` We do n't have any indications as to why it 's set up at that water depth , '' he said , an area meriting additional research . \nAnother unexpected result was the lack of `` dead zones , '' regions of significant oxygen depletion as a result of microbe metabolism . \n`` The oxygen data from the plume layer are telling us it is n't being rapidly consumed by microbes near the well , '' said Benjamin Van Mooy , a geochemist on the research team . \n`` The hydrocarbons could persist for some time . \nSo it is possible that oil could be transported considerable distances from the well before being degraded .

'' \nState authorities closed the lake 's eastern reaches to fishing on Monday , though most of it remained open . \nBarges were lined up at bayous and passes to stop the oil from coming in , and cleanup crews Tuesday used nets to collect tar balls from marinas and docks . \nThey also planned to lay 9,000 feet of special permeable booms , but the lake was too choppy for skimmer vessels to operate . \nAbout 1,700 pounds of oily waste has been collected , said Suzanne Parsons Stymiest , a spokeswoman for St. Tammany Parish . \nThe amount of oil infiltrating 600-square-mile Lake Pontchartrain -LRB- pronounced PAHN-chuh-trayn -RRB- appears small so far . \nAnd tests on seafood have not turned up any oil contamination , said Brian Lezina , a state biologist . \nBut the pollution is distressing to the many people in Louisiana who have a deep attachment to the lake . \n`` You wo n't hear songs about a lot of the marshes in south Louisiana , but you will hear songs about Lake Pontchartrain , '' Lezina said . \nOut in the Gulf , meanwhile , stormy weather kept skimmers from working offshore Tuesday for yet another day and delayed the hookup of a big new ship intended to suck more crude from the gushing blown-out well a mile underwater . \nAlso , the arrival of a Navy blimp intended to hover above the relief effort was delayed until Friday . \nTar balls from the spill also washed up on Texas beaches over the holiday weekend , meaning the disaster now touches all five Gulf Coast states , spanning more than 500 miles of coastline . \nLake Pontchartrain , named for the French count of Pontchartrain during the reign of Louis XIV , is on the northern edge of the city . \nIt is connected to the Gulf of Mexico by two main passes : the Rigolets , a winding passage of about 10 miles , and the Chef Menteur , around nine miles long . \nFor centuries , it has been a playground , a source of seafood and a backdoor route to New Orleans for invading British troops and hurricane storm surge . \nUntil the 1970s , its shores were a top destination for city folks who took streetcars and buses to the lake to swim and to dine at restaurants that cooked up the lake 's crabs and other seafood . \nThey played in penny arcades and rode the Zephyr roller coaster at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park . \nBut pollution shut down the swimming and chased away marine life , and the amusement park closed in the early 1980s . \nSlowly , the lake revived . \nIn recent years , sightings of dolphins and manatees have delighted locals , and commercial and recreational fishing is thriving . \nAnthony Montalbano Jr. , the chef and owner of II Tony 's , an Italian seafood restaurant next to the lake , said it has been a struggle to stay open . \nKatrina swamped his restaurant at Bucktown , a lakeside community in New Orleans that has the feel of a bayou town . \nAssociated Press writers Michael Kunzelman and Tom Breen in New Orleans contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "471", "time": "2010-04-23", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- No oil appeared to be leaking from a drilling rig that exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico , the Coast Guard said Friday , though officials were trying to contain what spilled after the blast and prevent any threat to the coast 's fragile ecosystem . \nThe search continued for 11 workers missing after the explosion late Tuesday on the Deepwater Horizon , though family members said they had been told they probably did not survive . \nThe rig burned for nearly two days until it sank Thursday morning . \nThe fire was out , but officials initially feared as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below . \nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said Friday morning that no oil appeared to be leaking from a well head at the ocean floor , nor was any leaking at the water 's surface . \nBut she said crews were closely monitoring the rig for any more crude that might spill out . \nThe crew was finishing the well about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast when the rig exploded . \nOfficials have not said what caused the blast , and the oil they are dealing with now is left over from the explosion and sinking . \n`` If it gets landward , it could be a disaster in the making , '' said Cynthia Sarthou , executive director for the environmental group Gulf Restoration Network . \nBP PLC , which leased the rig and took the lead in the cleanup , said Friday it has activated an extensive oil spill response , including using remotely operated vehicles to assess the well and 32 vessels to mop up the spill . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company will do `` everything in our power to contain this oil spill and resolve the situation as rapidly , safely and effectively as possible . '' \nEd Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor , said he expects some of the light crude oil to evaporate while much of it turns into a pasty mess that ultimately breaks apart into small chunks of oily residue that can wash ashore . \n`` It 's going to be a god-awful mess for a while , '' he said . \n`` I 'm not crying doomsday or saying the sky is falling , but that is the potential . '' \nWeather forecasts indicate the spill was likely to stay well away from shore at least through the weekend , but if winds change it could come ashore faster , said Doug Helton of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's office of response and restoration . \nThe Coast Guard , which was leading the investigation , had not given up the search early Friday for those missing from the rig . \nCarolyn Kemp of Monterey , La. , said her grandson , Roy Wyatt Kemp , 27 , would have been on the drilling platform when it exploded . \n`` They 're assuming all those men who were on the platform are dead , '' Kemp said . \n`` That 's the last we 've heard . '' \nMost of the crew -- 111 members -- were ashore , including 17 taken to hospitals . \nFour were in critical condition . \nFour others made it off safely were still on a boat operating one of several underwater robots being used to assess whether the flow of oil could be shut off at a control valve on the sea floor , said Guy Cantwell , spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. . \nLandry said crews saw a 1-mile-by-5-mile rainbow sheen of what appeared to be a crude oil mix on the surface . \nAt the worst-case figure of 336,000 gallons a day , it would take more than a month for the amount of crude oil spilled to equal the 11 million gallons spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound . \nA turn in winds and currents might send oil toward fragile coastal wetlands -- nurseries for fish and shrimp and habitat for birds . \n`` As you get closer to shore , you get richer and richer marine habitats , and also get the potential for long-term exposure , '' Helton said . \nTo prevent that , the Marine Spill Response Corp. , an energy industry cleanup consortium , brought seven skimmer boats to suck oily water from the surface , four planes that can scatter chemicals to disperse oil , and 500,000 feet -- 94.6 miles -- of containment boom , a floating barrier with a skirt that drapes down under the water and corrals the oil . \nIn addition to other environmental concerns , the well is in an area where a pod of sperm whales is known to feed , said Kim Amendola of NOAA . \nThose who escaped the rig did so mainly by getting on lifeboats that were lowered into the Gulf , said Adrian Rose , vice president of Transocean . \n`` There are a number of uncorroborated stories , a lot of them really quite heroic stories , of how people looked after each other . \nThere was very little panic , '' Rose said . \nFamily members of two missing workers filed separate lawsuits Thursday accusing Transocean and BP of negligence . \nBoth companies declined to comment about legal action against them after the first suit was filed . \nThe U.S. Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs , conducted three routine inspections of the Deepwater Horizon this year -- in February , March and on April 1 -- and found no violations , MMS spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said . \nApr. 21 : Fire boat crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon . \nApril 21 : In this aerial photo taken in the Gulf of Mexico more than 50 miles southeast of Venice on Louisiana 's tip , the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is seen burning . \n-LRB- AP -RRB- Stanley Murray , left , father of Chad Murray , who was rescued from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico , and Christy Murray , background right , hug loved ones of their unidentified neighbor , a crew member reported missing , after surviving crew members arrived at a hotel in Kenner , La. , Thursday , April 22 , 2010 . \n"}
{"id": "926", "time": "2010-08-27", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS -- The U.S. government said engineers will start work Monday to remove the temporary cap that stopped oil from gushing out of BP 's blown-out Gulf well so that crews can raise a key piece of equipment from the seabed . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the spill response , told reporters Friday that engineers must remove the cap so they can raise the failed blowout preventer . \nThe blowout preventer is considered a key piece of evidence in determining what caused the April rig explosion that unleashed the gushing oil . \nThe leak was first contained when engineers were able to place a cap atop BP 's well . \nWorkers then pumped mud and cement in through the top in a so-called `` static kill '' operation that significantly reduced pressure inside the well . \nOfficials do n't expect oil to leak into the sea again when the cap is removed , but Allen has ordered BP to be ready to collect any leaking crude just in case . \nThe Department of Justice and other federal investigators are overseeing the work to remove the blowout preventer , Allen said . \nThe 50-foot -LRB- 15-meter -RRB- , 600,000-pound -LRB- 272,000-kilogram -RRB- device -- which was designed to prevent such a catastrophe -- will be taken out of the water with the well pipe still inside to ensure the pipe does n't break apart any more than it already has . \nKeeping the blowout preventer intact is important because it 's considered an essential piece of evidence in determining what caused the blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon on April 20 . \nAfter the explosion , 206 million gallons -LRB- 800 million liters -RRB- of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico until the temporary cap stopped the flow . \nThe explosion on the rig -- which was owned by Transocean Ltd. and being operated by BP PLC -- killed 11 workers . \nEngineers are hoping the blowout preventer can be detached easily , but they are prepared to exert 80,000 pounds -LRB- 36,000 kilograms -RRB- of pressure if needed , Allen said . \nA new blowout preventer will be placed atop the well once the one that failed is raised . \nAfter that , the goal is to drill the final 50 feet -LRB- 15 meters -RRB- of a relief well beginning Sept. 7 , Allen said . \nFrom there , it will take about four days for drilling crews to reach their target . \nThe relief well has been called the ultimate solution to plugging the well . \nOnce the relief well is drilled , engineers will be able to pump mud and cement in through the bottom of the well , plugging the one that gushed oil once and for all . \nMeanwhile , the U.S. government said Friday that it is reopening more federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for commercial and recreational fishing that had been closed because of the spill . \nThe government is reopening 4,281 square miles -LRB- 11,000 sq. kilometers -RRB- of waters off the coast of western Louisiana . \nOil sheen has not been seen there since July 29 , and scientists found no oil or dispersants on samples of the area 's shrimp and fish . \nTwenty percent of federal waters in the Gulf remain closed . \n`` We 're sort of nibbling at the edges if you will , areas that have been free of oil for the longest time and were oiled the least , '' Lubchenco said . \nThe news came as hearings continued in Houston before the joint U.S. Coast Guard-Bureau of Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement investigative panel . \nOn Friday , Mark Hafle -- a BP drilling engineer who was a key decision maker at the now-sunken rig -- exercised his constitutional right to refuse to testify . \nThe panel 's goal is to determine what caused the explosion . \nThe panel also will make recommendations to prevent such a catastrophe in the future . \n"}
{"id": "1731", "time": "2010-08-20", "text": "GRAND ISLE , La. -- Biologist John Supan thinks he has developed what may be the holy grail for oyster lovers : a hardy breed of the delectable shellfish that stays fat enough for consumers to eat throughout the year . \nAnd unlike many oysters across the Gulf Coast , ruined by BP 's massive oil spill and the fresh water poured in to fight it , Supan 's oysters are all alive . \nNow , nearly four months after the spill , Supan 's oysters may offer the Gulf oyster industry a chance for a better long-term recovery . \nBut his special breed of modified oysters , which some say are prohibitively expensive , could be a hard sell to an industry reeling from the BP disaster . \nMost oystermen agree that few oysters will be harvested from the Gulf Coast in the next year or two , signaling a potential calamity for shucking houses , oyster farmers and people who love a half dozen oysters on the half shell . \nAs much as 65 percent of the nation 's oysters come from the Gulf . \nOysters are particularly susceptible to pollution , taking longer than fish or shrimp to clear oil contamination from their bodies . \nSupan 's oysters are bred for performance , making them more fit to deal with viruses and other contaminants . \nBeing sterile , they do n't go through the stress of reproduction , so they stay fat and juicy all year round . \nSupan says his oysters are sweet , plump and meaty in summertime when other oysters become thin and watery . \nBut the most crucial advantage this year was their mobility . \nUnlike the vast majority of oysters in the Gulf , which spend their lives on the bottoms of bays and sounds , Supan 's oysters dangle in the water in cages at a hatchery on the inland side of this island . \nWhen the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 just a few dozen miles from his hatchery , the 57-year-old Louisiana State University oyster biologist evacuated his broods to a research hatchery in Alabama and a wildlife preserve in western Louisiana . \nThen he brought them back . \n`` In my opinion , this is the most important brood of oysters in the history of the Gulf of Mexico , '' Supan says . \n`` But you know , you ask an oysterman that and they will say , ` Huh ? ' '' \nHe said the day is coming when all the Gulf 's oystermen will know what he 's talking about . \nFor three decades , Supan has been developing new oysters by mixing up their chromosomes in a process known as triploid production . \nHe breeds a rare oyster that has extra chromosomes with a normal oyster and produces a sterile hybrid . \nThe process is common on the East and West coasts but still untried in the Gulf , besides Supan 's batch . \n`` I do n't know if it 's the future with a capital ` THE , ' but it 's very important , '' said Bill Walton , an Auburn University shellfish biologist . \n`` It can give you a faster growing oyster . \nIt cuts down production time and it does seem to solve the problem of ` water bellies ' in the summer when oysters spawn and you have a tired , thin oyster . '' \n`` For the long-term viability of oysters in Louisiana what -LRB- the hatchery -RRB- is doing is the kind of pioneer work , '' said Mike Voisin , an oyster processor and leader in the Louisiana oyster industry . \nThe industry in Louisiana faces daunting threats from the oil pollution , oyster diseases and pressure from state and federal officials who want to reclaim lost marshland by opening up the Mississippi River even more often . \nIf that happens , traditional oyster grounds could be ruined in many of the inland bays where they are grown today . \nHelen Skansi , a 75-year-old Plaquemines Parish oyster company owner with more than 1,000 leased acres , is painfully aware of the problems . \n`` Things will never be the same with the bedding grounds they had before with the oil , '' she said . \nKenneth Fox , who leases 15,000 acres of state waters to grow his oysters , is equally concerned . \n`` I lost 95 percent of my leases with this oil spill , '' he said . \n`` Everything is dead on the west side of the river . '' \nAsked about Supan 's super oysters , however , he was unconvinced . \n`` I think the research is great , and I think what he 's doing is going to be a big help . \nBut that is going to be a costly process . '' \nSupan would like to see his special oyster larvae distributed through hatcheries across the Gulf to oyster growers . \nHe said he could start distributing the larvae now . \nBut a lot has to happen for that to materialize . \nIdeally , the sterile oysters would be grown in cages in special areas designated as marine farms . \nAnd a host of permitting and zoning issues would have to be resolved . \nGrowing oysters the way Supan does is tricky . \nThey are raised in structures propped up off the water bottom . \nThat requires new harvesting equipment . \nOystermen currently use mechanical devices like plows to scour their catch from the Gulf floor . \nIt also would require new permits . \nIt takes about two years for an oyster to grow to market size . \nOnce the special summer oysters grow to adult size , then the oyster growers would have to find buyers . \nTypically , a dozen oysters cost about $ 12 at an oyster bar on the Gulf Coast . \nSupan said a cost analysis has not been done to figure out how much the summer oysters would cost . \nHe says the market would take care of that . \n`` That 's a big investment on a gamble , '' Fox said of Supan 's experiments . \n`` I 'm not saying it wo n't happen one day , but the way Louisiana is set up , it 's going to be hard to make happen . \nHalf the people in the industry would have to get out of the business for the other half to make a profit . '' \nStill , some institutions that fund research are persuaded that Supan 's technique holds promise . \nSupan 's research has been backed by federal and state grants over his 30-year career . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently awarded Supan and other researchers a $ 250,000 grant to develop more hatchery technology . \nInside his algae room , Supan looks like a winemaker as he surveys tanks of algae he feeds to his oysters . \nThe bacteria grows under fluorescent light . \n`` It takes a wet green thumb to grow algae , '' he said . \n`` You got to be patient with it . \nIt 's very intuitive . \nJust like growing a garden . \nSome people say they talk to their house plants ; well , my algae and myself have conversations all the time . '' \nHe hopes the state will build an oyster dock where he can teach oyster farmers to grow oysters in saltier Gulf farms similar to his , where the oysters are reared to market size on platforms that thwart predators such as snails and bottom-feeding fish . \n"}

'' \nJustice Department spokeswoman Hannah August declined to comment on the investigation . \nAttorney General Eric Holder said in June that the government will prosecute violations of such laws as the Clean Water Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act . \nThe number of dead creatures will help determine the fines and penalties levied against BP and other companies involved . \nWildlife deaths will also figure into the government 's assessment of the spill 's damage to the Gulf 's natural resources . \nThat accounting could take years and will be used to bill BP and the other companies for the cost of restoring the environment . \nBy some estimates , they could be forced to pay billions of dollars -- more , perhaps , than the penalties associated with the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nExxon was hit with a record criminal fine of $ 150 million for the 1989 tanker spill in Alaska but ultimately paid $ 125 million in penalties . \nIt also agreed to pay $ 900 million to settle federal and state civil claims . \nThe spill of nearly 11 million gallons was the largest in U.S. history until it was eclipsed by the Gulf gusher that spewed some 206 million gallons from the blown-out BP well over three months . \nBP spokesman Robert Wine noted the oil company set aside $ 32.2 billion during the second quarter to cover the long-term cost of the spill . \nSince the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill , authorities have found thousands of dead animals . \nBut animals die every year in the Gulf from a variety of factors , including fishing , hurricanes , low oxygen levels and disease . \nAnd the vast majority of the hundreds of dead dolphins and sea turtles have had no visible signs of oil , so scientists have been forced to look more deeply . \n`` Is there damage to the eyes , to the skin ? \nAre there lesions in the stomach or in the lungs , which can occur during oil exposure . \nIs there microscopic damage to the liver , the kidney ? '' \nsaid Ziccardi , who directs the Oiled Wildlife Care Network at the University of California at Davis . \nThe results of the laboratory tests are still being compiled . \nThe dead animals are being kept at universities and public and private research centers across the Gulf Coast . \nCarcasses are taken from the freezer , thawed , photographed and examined internally and externally . \nAnyone who handles one of the carcasses must sign a log sheet that is used to keep track of when remains are removed and when are they put back . \nThe notebooks in which scientists recorded when and where they found a particular animal are regarded as vital evidence , too . \n"}

'' \nRoss was part of a team of researchers that studied deep sea corals in the Atlantic Ocean between North Carolina and Florida . \nThe research eventually helped lead to added federal protections for a roughly 23,000 square-mile network believed to be among the largest continuous distribution of deep water corals in the world . \nRoss and others have now turned their attention to the Gulf . \nWhile fishermen have for centuries dragged up corals from the deep sea , it was n't until the early 1900s that scientists discovered these extensive cold-water reefs . \nAnd it was n't until the 1970s that researchers were able to use subs and cameras to reach the sea floor to document them . \nIt had long been thought coral reefs only formed in shallow , warm waters . \nDeepwater reefs and pinnacles are much more slow-growing and can take several million years to form . \nScience is only now beginning to understand these underwater `` frontier zones . '' \nResearchers are looking to these regions for the development of additional pharmaceuticals since these cold-water critters have adapted to live in such unique environments void of sunlight , they possess unusual qualities that federal scientists say could aid in creating new drugs for cancer , heart disease and other ailments . \n`` We are very interested in any potential damage to deep sea corals , '' said Steve Murawski , chief fisheries scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which is currently conducting research into oil in Gulf sediments , among other studies . \nThe federal government maintains much of the oil is now gone from the Gulf , but some studies indicate it remains in significant amounts on the sea floor . \nMicroscopic particles have also been found in the water column . \nIt is now a prime time for coral spawning in the Gulf , when the corals release tiny larvae that eventually form new corals . \n`` It could alter the reproduction of these animals , '' Murawski said . \n`` Even though the adults may survive the event , did we lose the opportunity to have more juveniles produced ? '' \nSandra Brooke , coral conservation director at the Marine Conservation Biology Institute , who is also participating in the research , agreed . \nThe corals ' reproduction rates will be studied over the coming weeks , she said . \n`` We have to be careful with our conclusions about this kind of data , '' Brooke said , noting it will take more than just a few dives to determine the extent of the damage . \n`` We 'll take further analysis but from what we 've seen so far , it seems like they 've dodged a bullet . '' \nLong-term impacts , for instance , from 1989 's much smaller Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska took years , even decades to understand . \n`` We 're just going to have to continue watching , '' said Margot Stiles , a marine scientist with the conservation group Oceana . \n"}

'' \nThe national oil spill commission said in documents released Wednesday that the Obama administration kept scientists from being frank with the public and committed other missteps that raised questions about its competence and candor in the wake of the April 20 accident . \nPresident Obama created the commission to investigate the BP spill . \nAmong other things , the report says , the administration made erroneous early estimates of the spill 's size , and Obama 's senior energy adviser went on national TV and mischaracterized a government analysis by saying it showed most of the oil was `` gone . '' \nThe analysis actually said it could still be there . \nThe administration has disputed the commission findings , saying senior government officials `` were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be . '' \nThe report , citing interviews with government officials , reveals that in late April or early May , the White House budget office denied a request from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to make public its worst-case estimate of how much oil could spew from the blown-out well . \nThe Unified Command -- the government team in charge of the spill response -- also was discussing the possibility of making the numbers public , the report says . \nBut Kenneth Baer , a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget , said the budget office had concerns about the reliability of the NOAA estimates . \n`` The issue was the modeling , the science and the assumptions they were using to come up with their analysis . \nNot public relations or presentation , '' he said . \n`` We offered NOAA suggestions of ways to improve their analysis , and they happily accepted it . '' \nThe explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers , spewed 206 million gallons of oil from the damaged oil well , and sank the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . \nBP 's drilling permit for the well originally estimated the worst-case scenario to be a leak of 6.8 million gallons per day . \nIn late April , just after the spill began , the Coast Guard and NOAA received an updated worst-case estimate of 2.7 million to 4.6 million gallons per day . \nWhile those figures were used as the basis for the government 's response to the spill -- they appeared on an internal Coast Guard situation report and on a dry-erase board in NOAA 's Seattle war room -- they were never announced to the public , according to the report . \nFor more than a month after the explosion , government officials were telling the public that the well was releasing 210,000 gallons per day . \nIn early August , in its final estimate of the spill 's flow , the government said it was gushing 2.6 million gallons per day -- close to the worst-case predictions . \nThe documents also criticize Carol Browner , director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , saying that during a series of morning-show appearances on Aug. 4 , she misrepresented the findings of a federal analysis of where the oil went and incorrectly portrayed it as a scientific assessment that was peer-reviewed by inside and outside experts . \n`` I think it 's also important to note that our scientists have done an initial assessment , and more than three-quarters of the oil is gone , '' Browner said on NBC 's `` Today '' show . \nBut the analysis never said it was gone , according to the commission . \nIt said it was dispersed , dissolved or evaporated -- meaning it could still be there . \nAnd while NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco was more cautious in her remarks at a news conference at the White House later that day , the commission staff accuses the two senior officials of contributing to the perception that the government 's findings were more exact than they actually were . \nGibbs said he believes the administration was `` abundantly clear '' that day about what the oil budget represented . \n`` It represented the fact that there was very good news , that oil had biodegraded , that oil had been skimmed , that oil had been burned , '' he said . \n`` That the very worst-case scenarios that many people thought we would be dealing with never came to fruition largely because of that federal response .

Vern Buchanan , a Republican who represents part of Florida 's western coast , has introduced a bill aimed at blocking Cuba from drilling a new deepwater oil well in the waters off its northern coast . \nCiting threats to his state 's tourism industry and environment in the event of a potential oil spill , Buchanan has expressed concern that the communist country -- and the Spanish company it has contracted for running the Chinese-built rig -- would be incapable of handling the kind of disaster spill that strained U.S. response teams last spring . \nThe proposal would treat Cuba 's drilling industry kind of like Iran 's sanctioned energy sector . \nIt would empower the U.S. interior secretary to deny an oil-and-gas lease , or exploration permit , to any company dealing with a country under U.S. sanction or embargo . \nThough vague , the language is directed at Spanish oil-and-gas firm Repsol , which is heading up Cuba 's new oil plans . \nThe issue troubling Buchanan is that Cuba is looking to drill for oil even deeper than BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded last April and sent millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf . \nNot only would Cuba 's well be deeper -- at 5,600 feet compared to 5,000 feet -- but Buchanan said it would be at the edge of Cuba 's territorial waters , 50 miles from the Florida coast . \n`` As we have learned from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , an oil spill can devastate a regional economy and impose serious long-term environment damage to precious natural resources , '' he said in a written statement . \nIn the event of a spill , he said , `` quickly capping the well would be extremely difficult , if not impossible . '' \nBuchanan said the hypothetical oil slick would take `` just three days '' to reach Florida 's beaches , which drives its tourism economy . \nBuchanan spokesman Max Goodman called the bill `` very time sensitive , '' with drilling slated to begin within a year . \nHis office suggested Cuba 's government could not be counted on to clean up another mega-spill . \nAsked whether Repsol would be able to step in , Repsol representative Kristian Rix told FoxNews.com the company `` adheres to the strictest safety measures '' and develops `` comprehensive accident response plans '' in every country where it does business . \n`` We have every confidence that our teams and equipment are well prepared to carry out operations safely and effectively , '' Rix , the firm 's international and financial media manager , said in an e-mail . \nA Spanish court began an investigation last year into a spill at one of Repsol 's Mediterranean rigs , though that leak was not anywhere near as colossal as the BP spill . \nFor the new rig , the United States could not directly block Cuba from drilling in its own waters . \nBut under Buchanan 's bill the U.S. could threaten Repsol 's projects elsewhere in U.S. territory . \nThe company operates rigs near Texas and Louisiana . \nWith his bill , Buchanan wants to compel Repsol to abandon the Cuba drilling to protect its other assets . \nThe company earlier backed off a natural gas project in Iran after facing pressure from the United States over Iran 's nuclear program . \nBuchanan 's not the only prominent Floridian to warn about the danger of new international drilling near the Sunshine State 's shores . \nFormer Sen. Bob Graham warned in a speech Jan. 14 that Cuba is planning other drilling projects with a Russian firm . \nAccording to an account of the speech in The Miami Herald , Graham said the United States should partner with Mexico to draft new international drilling safety standards in the Gulf . \nIn addition , he said , Mexico should press Cuba to impose such standards . \nGraham said the BP spill should be a `` wake-up call . '' \nThe BP spill dumped an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf , hammering the coastline and offshore waters as well as the region 's fishing and tourism economies . \nFlorida 's $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry stood to suffer the most . \nA report put out last summer by the U.S. Travel Association said Florida 's losses over the next three years could amount to nearly $ 19 billion . \nBuchanan last expressed concerns about the Cuba project in a letter to President Obama in October . \nHis bill has so far attracted just two co-sponsors -- both Florida Republicans -- but Goodman said the congressman is seeking bipartisan support . \nThe Interior Department had no comment when asked Monday whether Secretary Ken Salazar was interested in attaining or exercising the authority Buchanan wants to give him . \n"}

Bobby Jindal at a press conference held to address the reopening of commercial fishing areas along the Louisiana coast in Venice , La. . \nAP July 31 : Oil containment boom is laid out in Treasure Pass , in waters near Yscloskey , La. . \nAP Experts have said for some time that the oil spill in the Gulf is one of the greatest environmental disasters in history , and the government has grim new figures to confirm that fact . \nThe Obama administration said Monday that scientists now estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil have leaked into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sunk the BP-run Deepwater Horizon offshore rig . \n`` Not all of this oil and gas flowed into the ocean , '' the administration said in its latest report on the disaster , noting that about 800,000 barrels of oil were captured before the well was capped in mid-July . \nThe latest figures still are enough to secure the BP spill 's status as the world 's worst accidental release of oil , topping Mexico 's 1979 spill at Ixtoc I , which leaked 3.3 million barrels of oil . \nBP still has yet to permanently plug the busted well . \nAfter insisting for months that a pair of costly relief wells were the only surefire way to kill the oil leak at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , BP officials said Monday they may be able to do it just with lines running from a ship to the blown-out well a mile below . \nAs crews planned testing to determine whether to proceed with a `` static kill '' to pump mud and perhaps cement down the throat of the well , BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said if it 's successful the relief wells may not be needed , after all , to do the same weeks later from the bottom . \nThe primary relief well , near completion , will still be finished and could be used simply to ensure the leak is plugged , Wells said . \n`` Even if we were to pump the cement from the top , we will still continue on with the relief well and confirm that the well is dead , '' he said . \nEither way , `` we want to end up with cement in the bottom of the hole . '' \nGovernment officials and company executives have long said the wells , which can cost about $ 100 million each , may be the only way to make certain the oil is contained to its vast undersea reservoir . \nThe company began drilling the primary , 18,000-foot relief well May 2 , 12 days after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and killed 11 workers , and a second backup well May 16 . \nThe first well is now only about 100 feet from the target , and Wells said it could reach it as early as Aug. 11 . \n`` Precisely what the relief wells will do remains to be seen given what we learn from the static kill , '' BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said . \n`` Ca n't predict it for certain . '' \nRetired Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill response , said Monday that the focus now is on making sure the static kill is successful . \nBut he cautioned that federal officials do n't see it as `` the end all , be all until we get the relief well done . '' \nOne of the biggest variables is whether the area called the annulus , which is between the inner piping and the outer casing , has sprung an oil leak . \nEngineers probably wo n't be able to answer that question until they drill in from the bottom , he said . \n`` Everyone would like to have this thing over as soon as possible , '' Allen said , adding : `` We do n't know the condition of the well until we start pushing mud into it . '' \nThe company 's statements Monday might signal that it is more concerned than it has acknowledged about debris found in the relief well after it was briefly capped as Tropical Storm Bonnie passed last week , said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor . \nPlus , trying to seal the well from the top gives BP two shots at ending the disaster , Overton said . \n`` Frankly , if they can shut it off from the top and it 's a good , permanent seal , I 'll take it , '' Overton said . \n`` A bird in the hand at this point is a good thing with this deal . '' \nBefore the effort can begin , engineers must probe the broken blowout preventer with an oil-like liquid to decide whether it can handle the static kill process . \nThey had hoped to begin the hours-long test Monday but delayed it until Tuesday after a small leak was discovered in the hydraulic control system . \nThe static kill is meant as a bit of insurance for the crews who have spent months fighting the oil spill . \nThe only thing keeping oil from blowing into the Gulf at the moment is the experimental cap , which has held for more than two weeks but was never meant to be permanent . \nBP and federal officials have managed to contain large parts of the spill through skimmers , oil-absorbant boom and chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil . \nFederal regulators have come under fire from critics who say that BP was allowed to use excessive amounts of the dispersants , but government officials counter that they have helped dramatically cut the use of the chemicals since late May . \nThe Environmental Protection Agency released a study Monday concluding that when mixed with oil , chemical dispersants used to break up the crude in the Gulf are no more toxic to aquatic life than oil alone . \n"}
{"id": "1467", "time": "2010-07-19", "text": "MIAMI -- Using a law originally enacted to combat the Mafia , attorneys are filing lawsuits accusing BP PLC and Transocean Ltd. of committing a longterm series of crimes by concealing flaws in deepwater drilling plans and lacking safeguards to contain a catastrophic Gulf of Mexico spill . \nBP has been named in at least three lawsuits brought under the federal law known as RICO , which stands for Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations . \nTransocean , which leased the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon drilling rig to BP , has been named in two lawsuits filed in Louisiana and Florida . \nThe lawsuits accuse both companies of committing wire and mail fraud over a number of years by filing false documents with the U.S. government , and by misleading investors through other documents and falsehoods . \nThey also claim both companies are guilty of bribery because they are part of an overall oil and gas industry effort to `` infiltrate '' federal regulators by providing favors such as alcohol and drugs , sex , golf and ski trips , concert and sports tickets , and more . \n`` The pattern of racketeering activity engaged in by defendants involves a scheme to fraudulently create a pretense of safety to the public while , at every turn , seeking to avoid the costs associated with actually conducting their operations in a safe manner , '' claims a lawsuit filed by Louisiana attorney Daniel Becnel and others on behalf of a restaurant seeking to represent a huge class of businesses suffering economic loss from the oil spill . \nRICO , passed by Congress in 1970 , contains both a civil and criminal component , but both of them rely on proof of longterm violations of at least two specific crimes from a lengthy list . \nThe attraction of the civil portion , which are being used in the current lawsuits , is that any damages would be tripled . \nIn the past , civil RICO cases have often been followed by criminal prosecutions . \nThe Justice Department has not ruled out using RICO in its ongoing criminal investigation of the Deepwater Horizon explosion , which killed 11 rig workers and triggered a massive oil spill that has affected five Gulf Coast states . \nCriminal convictions can lead to prison sentences of 20 years on each racketeering count , plus hefty fines and forfeiture of ill-gotten gains . \n`` We are investigating any possible violations of the law , '' said Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August . \nBP declined comment on the RICO allegations . \nTransocean did not respond to a request for comment . \nFlorida attorney Peter Prieto , a former federal prosecutor , said it might be a stretch for the Justice Department to bring a criminal RICO case when there might be easier-to-prove offenses . \n`` If it 's a simpler crime , that 's what they are going to do . \nProsecutors are going to use RICO when it is truly applicable or when it involves organized crime , '' said Prieto , who is not involved in the oil spill cases . \n`` It is kind of a hammer , but if the facts fit RICO , you can use RICO . '' \nEven as use of RICO in criminal cases has waned somewhat , it 's become increasingly popular on the civil side . \nThis year alone , RICO lawsuits have been filed against the Roman Catholic Church over priest abuses ; Toyota over its sudden acceleration problems ; a group of title insurers over alleged overcharges ; and online cigarette vendors over lost tax revenue . \nIn March , pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was ordered by a Boston jury to pay $ 142 million in damages for wrongly marketing the epilepsy drug Neurontin as treatment for migraines and bipolar disorder . \nThe difficulty in the BP and Transocean cases , some experts say , is finding evidence tying the companies ' actions to damages caused by the spill . \nOn the criminal side , a prosecutor would have to have ironclad proof of criminal intent , not just negligence or stupidity . \n`` The problem is just connecting the dots , '' said Thomas Walker , an Idaho attorney who has tried about 20 civil RICO cases and maintains a blog on RICO . \n`` The fraudulent communications , if they were fraudulent , went from BP to the government . \nThe damage was not caused by the letter , it was caused by the oil spill . '' \nThe RICO lawsuits are among more than 200 filed against BP , Transocean and other companies seeking damages for economic losses , environmental damage and shareholder losses . \nA federal judicial panel will meet July 29 in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of them for pretrial purposes . \nPotential damages from those lawsuits would come on top of the $ 20 billion BP has pledged to set aside to pay claims and other spill cleanup costs . \nMost of the criminal allegations in the RICO lawsuits are taken from testimony and documents produced by congressional investigations of the spill , documents filed with financial regulators and investors , and even investigative news articles by The Associated Press and other news outlets . \nFor example , the Louisiana complaint charges that : -- According to an AP story , an independent firm hired by BP in 2009 found the company was violating its own policies by failing to have key engineering documents aboard the deepwater drilling rig Alantis . \nThe study was never disclosed to regulators . \n-- BP filed documents showing it had a solid response plan for a catastrophic oil spill , when in fact it `` lacked any meaningful ability '' to resond . \n-- BP repeatedly failed to disclose to the U.S. Interior Department a range of safety concerns about the Deepwater Horizon , including use of a risky well cementing technique and problems with pockets of flammable natural gas . \n-- Transocean assured investors and regulators that it had an excellent safety record , when in fact it was responsible for an increasing number of accidents on deepwater drilling rigs . \n-- Both companies are part of an oil industry effort to prevent the Minerals Management Service -- now renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management -- from imposing tough rules , in part through industry events where government officials were given cocaine , marijuana and alcohol , had sex with company executives and received gifts ranging from exotic travel to concert tickets . \n"}
{"id": "1155", "time": "2010-07-26", "text": "GRAND ISLE , La. -- The women of Grand Isle are nervous . \nUsed to be , they say , they could walk the streets of their beachside town alone , getting a little exercise after the hottest part of the day or setting out the trash after midnight . \nNow , a waitress wo n't let her 14-year-old daughter stroll to the store for a Coke , a souvenir shop owner is afraid to sit on her porch after dark and a bartender deadbolts her door , a newly purchased gun nearby . \nThe vacationing families and sport fishermen who make this tourist town of 1,500 what it is are absent this summer , replaced by an army of workers brought in by BP to clean up the massive Gulf Coast oil spill . \nThe outsiders walk in small groups along Route 1 at workday 's end and sometimes cut across lawns and under elevated houses to reach bars like Daddy 's Money , where women wrestle in oil . \nSome wear low-slung jeans , which prompted this warning note on one convenience store door : `` No pants on the ground allowed . '' \nWhat do such reactions mean ? \nA BP official says some culture clash is understandable , though he 's occasionally seen outright racial bias at work . \nBut talk to some of the mostly white residents , and they do n't directly mention the skin color of the workers , most of whom are black . \nThe workers , they say , just act different . \nAnd that makes some people uneasy , even though the vast majority of the workers pose no threat . \nVicki McVey , a 44-year-old who pours beers at Artie 's Sports Bar , says she 's not taking any chances . \n`` Never had a gun . \nNever had a weapon . \nNow I got a weapon right next to my bed , '' says McVey , who stopped taking her grandson to the park when cleanup workers moved into a trailer nearby . \n`` You go to the park and they come and they touch you and want to talk to you and they harass you , '' she complains . \nFears like McVey 's do n't surprise the men whose presence prompts them . \nFriday night , several black men in town for the cleanup sat in a grassy area near the island 's only grocery store , deciding what meat to buy to grill for dinner . \nThey said they had n't been treated badly , though like most cleanup workers along the coast , they did n't want to give their names for fear of losing their jobs . \n`` This little town is just like any little town in the country , '' said one , who identified himself only as Daryl . \n`` A bunch of strangers are going to scare them . \nA bunch of black strangers are going to scare them even more . '' \nAnother worker said he and his peers mostly just keep to themselves . \n`` People treat you OK , '' he said . \n`` But they have n't put any picnics on for us . '' \nPeople in town are talking about a recent stabbing , the first anyone can remember in ages -LRB- one published report said both victim and attacker were cleanup workers -RRB- . \nLocals suspect the workers when items go missing now , including golf carts that folks often use to get around . \nNo one offers facts and figures to back up the stories . \nNeither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff 's Office nor Police Chief Euris DuBois , who 's upset over recent media reports about his town , would provide crime statistics or speak to The Associated Press . \nBut the perception of a problem is undeniable . \n`` You used to be able to go and enjoy yourself , you know ? \nHave a few drinks with your friends , '' says 68-year-old Emma Chighizola , who used to sit outside and listen to the waves after a day of selling T-shirts and seashell tchotchkes at Blue Water Souvenirs . \n`` Now it 's kind of dangerous . \nThere 's too many strangers . '' \nParish Councilman Chris Roberts says he 's witnessed `` hostile environments ... no question . '' \nTension is natural when a small town has a sudden influx of outsiders , Roberts says , and parish officials are monitoring it . \nBut bringing in help is necessary , he said : `` There 's not -LRB- local -RRB- people lining up to go work in 105-degree heat to clean the beach . '' \nBP spokesman Jason French says some 1,800 workers from around the country report to Grand Isle at least once a day , including almost 300 who clean the town 's beaches . \nBP tried to hire locals , he says , but no more than three dozen submitted applications for jobs that pay as little as $ 12 an hour . \nSome tension in town is over cultural differences , he says , `` but I ca n't deny there has been some racism . '' \nWhile BP wo n't respond to complaints it considers motivated by bias , French says it does promptly address any legitimate behavioral problems . \nWorkers , for example , were told to stop crossing lawns because they were trespassing . \nBP also dismissed some cleanup workers for unspecified misbehavior , though French ca n't say how many because they worked for subcontractors . \nThe oil company has begun requiring those contractors to screen workers for drug and alcohol use as a condition of employment . \n`` As someone who 's been here for months , I get frustrated when workers are painted with a broad brush or the community is painted with a broad brush , '' French says . \n`` It 's not a community of racists any more than we have convicts working the beach . \n`` These are hardworking people working the beaches , '' he says , `` and there are people who are nervous because they 're seeing something they have n't seen before . '' \nAll along the Louisiana coast , the flood of oil spill workers has temporarily altered towns . \nQuiet fishing villages in St. Bernard Parish have become small cities that bustle like military bases , with security checkpoints , a round-the-clock police presence and the never-ending rumble of trucks hauling food , trash and equipment on narrow country roads . \nAnd besides the influx of men and machines , there 's a deeper factor underlying locals ' mood . \nThey talk of frustration over the loss of something simple -- the joy of a summer on the water . \nThat disappeared when the Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 oil rig workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil . \n`` You do n't hear no fishing stories , no beach stories , no talking about their kids and how they caught their first fish . \nNone of that , '' says Buggie Vegas , owner of the Bridge Side Marina in Grand Isle . \n`` It 's just work , work , work . \nEvery day , from a Saturday to a Monday to a Wednesday . \nWe do n't know what day it is . \nIt do n't matter what day it is . '' \nVegas ' 30 rental units are full and his store still has some business , but it 's different : Instead of selling bait and tackle or T-shirts , he 's stocking green plastic hardhats , black rubber boots and tie-down straps . \n`` Everybody 's like robots , '' he says . \n`` They just trying to get hired on . '' \nArtie 's Sports Bar normally employs 16 bartenders who serve 2,000 people and pocket at least $ 250 in tips on a Saturday night . \nNow , it takes just six of them to wait on a crowd of 100 . \nSecurity guards who used to work only on weekends now monitor the door at Artie 's every night , checking patrons for weapons and watching closely for trouble . \nWhen she does n't like how things are going , McVey plays country music , hoping the crowd will move on . \nShannon Ronquille , a 33-year-old waitress , says authorities patrol the beach on four-wheelers at night , protecting waterfront homes that owners are reluctant to rent to cleanup crews . \nIt does n't help that business is off more than 60 percent at Barataria Seafood Grill , the island 's only fine dining establishment -- a place where , in normal times , dressed-up vacationers often wait an hour for seating . \n`` Now , '' Ronquille says , looking over the empty , white linen-covered tables , `` we have guys coming in with oil all over their boots . '' \nTwo and a half hours away in Arabi , the tension manifests itself differently . \nThere , a former school , renamed Camp Hope after Hurricane Katrina , has for five years been home to volunteers from across the country who came to rebuild storm-wrecked homes . \nBut in June , the volunteers were told to move : BP was converting the building to a work camp . \n`` All the locals were more than happy to see AmeriCorps people here , that people were helping to rebuild , and it 's just a stark contrast to that , '' says 20-year-old AmeriCorps worker Kyla Philbrook , of Albany , N.Y. St. Bernard Parish has been spared the complaints that mar Grand Isle for several reasons : In Hopedale , Shell Beach and Delacroix , there 's no infrastructure to support thousands of workers . \nMany workers are bused in for the day . \nLaw enforcement , citing lessons from Katrina , also set the tone early on : In May , Sheriff Jack Stephens declared the community `` wo n't tolerate a criminal invasion in the guise of people claiming they are arriving to help . '' \nA month later , he asked federal immigration officials to investigate claims illegal immigrants were working for BP . \n`` We 're not worried about people who want to earn an honest buck , '' he said at the time . \nSince then , deputies have made only a handful of arrests . \nUnder a deal with BP , off-duty deputies provide paid security at worker encampments . \nAnd deputies `` engage '' every chance they get , whether at a traffic stop or a checkpoint , says Chief Deputy James Pohlmann , who notes that BP has strict rules for the Arabi camp . \n`` It 's like an extension of the job . \nThere 's no alcohol , no weapons , '' he says . \n`` If you leave , you have to leave on a shuttle bus to a parking lot that 's offsite . '' \nThough workers are free to leave in their own vehicles , they are not free to walk around the neighborhood . \nIf caught doing so , their ID is seized , `` and what that means is , you lost your job . '' \nIn Hopedale , oysterboat captain Michael Anglin says the strategies are working . \nHe 's even made some friends among the outsiders . \n`` There 's tension sometimes , but it 's just like any job , '' he says . \n`` It 's mostly been on where you park your car . \nIn the wrong spot , somebody gets a little arrogant . \nAnd fishermen do n't put up with that . \nIt 's our town , ya know . \nYou just visiting . '' \nTraffic , in fact , is the biggest complaint among residents who watch weed-filled lots slashed and burned to make way for trailers . \nAt the end of Hopedale Highway in Breton Sound Marina , BP runs a mess tent that feeds workers three meals a day . \nThat means a steady stream of vehicles . \n`` I 'm scared to let my kids cross the highway , '' says 55-year-old former fisherman Kurt Guerra , his 9-year-old daughter Cassie playing on a swingset a few hundred feet from the pavement . \nThe presence of so many strangers is unsettling , Guerra says , but with barely a place to buy a beer , problems are few . \n"}
{"id": "478", "time": "2010-07-26", "text": "June 16 , 2010 : BP CEO Tony Hayward and Managing Director Bob Dudley , in background , are seen leaving the White House after meeting with President Obama . \nReuters BP 's embattled boss Tony Hayward is set to be replaced amid `` leadership changes '' at the firm , Fox News confirmed on Sunday . \nHayward , under heavy fire for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster that followed the April explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , is set to step down Monday . \nBP 's managing director Bob Dudley will step in as the new CEO , The Wall Street Journal reported . \nEarlier Sunday , BP spokesman Toby Odone seemed to downplay media speculation about Hayward 's departure , saying he `` remains BP 's chief executive , and he has the confidence of the board and senior management . \n`` BP 's board would have to approve a change in company leadership . \nAn official announcement could come as early as Monday . \nBP is due to release its second quarter results on Tuesday , and the board of directors is scheduled to meet before the earnings announcement . \nIt 's been more than three months since an offshore drilling rig operated by BP exploded off Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the spill . \nA temporary plug has stopped oil from gushing for more than a week now , but before that the busted well had spewed anywhere from 94 million gallons to 184 million gallons into the Gulf . \nCrews trying to plug the leaky well for good had to stop work late last week because of the threat from Tropical Storm Bonnie , but the effort was back on track as skies cleared Sunday . \nA drill rig is expected to reconnect at around midnight to the relief tunnel that will be used to pump in mud and cement to seal the well , and drilling could resume in the next few days . \nSince the explosion , Hayward has made several highly publicized gaffes . \nAmong them : going to a yacht race while oil washed up on Gulf shores , and uttering the now-infamous : `` I want my life back '' line . \nOppenheimer & Co. senior analyst Fadel Gheit said in an interview Sunday that it was too bad Hayward 's career was derailed by the spill , but `` unfortunately he became a sacrificial lamb in a politically charged world . '' \nDudley would be well-suited to take over , Gheit said , describing him as even-tempered and a good delegator . \nIt 's never an easy time to instill new leadership in a company , though , he noted . \n`` I 'm not sure if removing Tony Hayward is going to throw BP 's problems away , '' Gheit said . \nThe company has already spent roughly $ 4 billion on its response to the crisis . \nThe final tally could be in the tens of billions of dollars . \nNews that the CEO will depart came as no surprise to people living along the Gulf . \nPatrick Shay , 43 , sat on a porch swing of his cottage in Grand Isle , Louisiana , on Sunday , his front yard filled with small , white crosses , each bearing the name of sealife or ways of life the oil spill has killed . \n`` He seems like a pretty self-absorbed person , so I 'm not surprised to hear he would walk away in the middle of all this , '' he said . \n`` If anything it will help . \nThey need to get him out of the way and get this cleaned up . '' \nIn New Orleans , Chris Hearn , a 23-year-old security guard , said what 's important is getting the oil stopped permanently . \n`` It does n't matter who 's in charge , '' he said . \n`` As long as they clean it up , I really could care less . \nThey just need to get it cleaned up because it 's affecting all of us down here .

Thad Allen and BP officials conceded . \nEven if it 's not a direct hit , the rough weather will push back efforts to kill the well by at least a week . \n`` While this is not a hurricane , it 's a storm that will have probably some significant impacts , we 're taking appropriate cautions , '' Allen said in Mobile , Ala. . \nAllen issued the order Thursday night to begin moving dozens of vessels from the spill site , including the rig that 's drilling the relief tunnel engineers will use to permanently throttle the free-flowing crude near the bottom of the well . \nSome vessels could stay on site , he said . \n`` While these actions may delay the effort to kill the well for several days , the safety of the individuals at the well site is our highest concern , '' he said in a statement . \nA week of steady measurements through cameras and other devices convinced Allen they do n't need to open vents to relieve pressure on the cap , which engineers had worried might contribute to leaks underground and an even bigger blowout . \nThe cap was attached a week ago , and only minor leaks have been detected . \nAllen said earlier in the day that evacuating the vessels could leave the well head unmonitored for up to a few days . \nHe said he ordered BP to make sure that the ships carrying the robotic submarines watching the well are the last to leave and the first to return . \nIt was unclear Thursday night whether some of the vessels would go back to port or head further south in the Gulf out of the path of the storm and await orders once the storm passes . \nThe Coast Guard cutter Decisive , the hurricane guard for the vessels at the spill site , was awaiting instructions . \nIn an evacuation , the Decisive is the last vessel to leave the area . \nBonnie caused flooding in Puerto Rico , the Dominican Republic and Haiti before reaching tropical storm strength later Thursday , and Allen said crews expected sustained wind above 39 mph at the spill site by early Saturday . \nSeas already were choppy in the Gulf , with waves up to five feet rocking boats as crews prepared to leave , and more of the smaller boats involved in the coastal cleanup were called into port , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft said . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he expects local leaders in coastal parishes to call for evacuation of low-lying areas as early as Friday morning . \nAt the spill site , the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar . \nBut the oil is still there beneath the surface , staining the hull of cutters motoring around in it . \nOne large vessel -- the Helix Q4000 -- is burning off oil collected from the water , and bright orange flames flared at the side of the ship . \nScientists say even a severe storm should n't affect the well cap , nearly a mile beneath the ocean surface 40 miles from the Louisiana coast . \n`` Assuming all lines are disconnected from the surface , there should be no effect on the well head by a passing surface storm , '' said Paul Bommer , professor of petroleum engineering at University of Texas at Austin . \nCharles Harwell , a BP contractor monitoring the cap , was also confident . \n`` That cap was specially made , it 's on tight , we 've been looking at the progress and it 's all good , '' he said after his ship returned to Port Fourchon , La. . \nBefore the cap was attached and closed a week ago , the broken well spewed 94 million to 184 million gallons into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nWork on plugging the well came to a standstill Wednesday , just days before authorities had hoped to complete the relief shaft . \nAllen said Thursday he has told BP to go ahead preparing for a second measure called a static kill that would pump mud and cement into the well from the top , a move he said would increase the relief well 's chances for success . \nBP will have to get final approval from Allen before starting the procedure . \nVice President Joe Biden visited cleanup workers in southern Alabama , and said he was cheered the cap could remain on . \nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long in Port Fourchon , La. , Michael Kunzelman in New Orleans and Melissa Nelson in Theodore , Ala. , contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "353", "time": "2010-07-28", "text": "On Day 100 of the Gulf catastrophe -- and one day after a rig accident caused yet another oil leak in Gulf waters -- it 's worth recalling that memorable line from `` Spiderman : The Movie '' : `` With great power comes great responsibility . '' \nAs one of the world 's largest companies , BP wields awesome power , which it uses to find and exploit reservoirs of crude oil thousands of feet below the ocean floor . \nSuch power put BP in a position to risk not only the destruction of a rig and the deaths of workers , but also incalculable harm to the Gulf 's environment and local economies . \nEthical reflection on BP 's actions leading up to the oil spill holds a lesson for other powerful firms involved in perilous enterprises . \nThe Deepwater Horizon was a machine of immense size and complexity , with employees of various companies carrying out a host of often difficult and complicated tasks . \nAnd certainly the challenges of risk management would have been daunting when safe operation of the rig relied on so many variables relating to equipment , personnel , weather , deepwater conditions and subterranean geology . \nPrecisely because the risks were so great and so numerous , BP 's prime responsibility of minimizing catastrophic risk would have required having an official , with the requisite skills and authority , in charge of safety on the rig . \nThis supervisor , dedicated solely to safety oversight , would have coordinated the constant monitoring of risk factors and made sure that risks related to proposed deviations from standard practice were duly evaluated and authorized . \nThis official would have assured that emergency response plans were current and that all workers were trained to implement them . \nEmergency equipment and procedures would have been regularly and rigorously tested , using established , data-based criteria . \nTop managers would have made sure that every rig had a strong safety culture , such that an overriding concern for safety would have been built in to management practices . \nSadly , this seems not to have been the case . \nBP has declared that its `` absolute No. 1 priority '' is safety . \nBut evidence to the contrary , at least on the Deepwater Horizon , appeared in a recent New York Times story about the now-famous `` blowout preventer . '' \nIt turns out that there are hundreds of ways this `` ultimate fail-safe device '' can fail . \nIndeed , a study commissioned by Transocean , the Deepwater Horizon 's owner , concluded that , historically , blowout preventers on deepwater rigs had a failure rate of 45 % . \nEqually astonishing is that their key component , the `` blind shear ram , '' is vulnerable to catastrophic failure through the breakdown of just a single part . \nIn a blowout , this apparatus -- whose powerful blades are pushed together by hydraulic fluid -- is designed to sever and seal the drill pipe . \nHowever , one of the ram 's shuttle valves is such that , if it sticks or leaks , the blades ca n't be activated . \nIncredibly , this valve has no backup . \n-LRB- There are indications that the calamitous failure of the Deepwater Horizon 's blind shear ram was due to leaks in one or more shuttle valves . -RRB- \nMoreover , a blind shear ram 's effectiveness is diminished by the extreme pressure and cold of deep water , the fact that modern drill pipe is twice as strong as older pipe , and the impossibility of slicing through the joint-sections that make up nearly 10 percent of a drill pipe . \nBP and the rest of the oil industry were well aware of the weaknesses of blowout preventers , particularly since the failure of blind shear rams had been implicated in several major oil spills . \nDrillers had begun to address the problems by installing two blind shear rams in their blowout preventers . \nIn fact , on the day of the Gulf oil spill , every other BP rig under contract from Transocean was equipped with dual blind shear rams . \nThe last thorough maintenance review of the Deepwater Horizon , in 2005 , revealed serious problems with the blowout preventer , including faulty controls and a badly leaking line connecting the rig to the blowout preventer . \nDespite such well-documented vulnerabilities , BP decided not to reconfigure the Deepwater Horizon 's blowout preventer with a second blind shear ram . \nIn the days preceding the April 20 explosion , against the advice of contractors and over the protests of workers , BP skipped several crucial safety steps needed to make sure gas would n't escape from the well and ignite . \nSuch actions cast doubt on any suggestion that a `` safety culture '' existed on the rig . \nThus , it comes as no surprise that , as The Times also reported , no BP official had overall responsibility for safety on the Deepwater Horizon . \nThis points to the main lesson of this case : In hazardous operations -- such as the search for energy sources in increasingly dangerous environments -- minimizing catastrophic risk demands strong , accountable safety supervisors and workable , realistic planning for emergencies . \nOtherwise , companies conducting such operations -- in oil exploration , coal mining , nuclear power generation , or any other high-risk business -- are following BP 's path to disaster . \nDana M.

Bobby Jindal looks over the berm system on the northern end of the Chandeleur Islands , La. , July 15 . \n-LRB- AP Photo -RRB- The BP oil spill may be choking the Gulf ecosystem , but for a few well-positioned coastal politicians it has breathed new life into their careers . \nAcross the Gulf states , the spill has over the past 100 days given lawmakers the chance to step into the national spotlight and show a little leadership -- by wrestling with the Obama administration , sounding off against BP and pulling the battered Gulf region through yet another environmental and economic crisis . \nThough Gulf fisherman , rig workers and practically everyone tied to coastal tourism are facing an uncertain future , the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history , nevertheless , could bolster a handful of political fortunes , especially with voters having 97 days to decide on their candidates before the Nov. 2 election . \nBut first , there may be no better example of a political comeback than Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . \nA year ago , the governor was pilloried for delivering a lackluster GOP response to President Obama 's first address to Congress . \nThe performance appeared to bench him as a potential 2012 presidential hopeful for the Republican Party . \nHe was n't even a choice on the 2012 straw poll ballots at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference or the Conservative Political Action Conference this year -- though he said he was n't interested anyway . \nBut Jindal sprung into action shortly after the deadly April 20 explosion that triggered the spill at the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nHe criticized the federal government for being slow to respond and he fought the administration over its moratorium on offshore drilling . \nAnd he made a very public and visible effort to show he was on top of the disaster response -- touring the coast , putting out a restoration plan and holding frequent press conferences to talk about it . \nImages of Jindal giving his allegedly bumbling response to the presidential address were replaced by images of Jindal on a boat getting up close and personal with the oil damage . \n`` Probably the person who 's come out of this the best is Bobby Jindal , '' said Kirby Goidel , political science professor and director of the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University . \n`` This is all a chance to be redefined as someone who 's an advocate . '' \nA Rasmussen Reports poll released at the end of June showed Jindal 's state approval rating at 74 percent -- a 10-percentage-point jump from April . \nGoidel said Jindal has virtually assured re-election in the 2011 gubernatorial race . \nHe said despite claims that Jindal has the job he wants , `` there 's no question '' the governor has ambitions for the White House . \nHe said both Jindal and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist have shown oil spill leadership in a way that should help them with voters . \nOf the two , Crist faces the most immediate political challenge . \nThe former Republican made the risky move of switching his affiliation to independent in his run for the U.S. Senate this fall . \nBut the Real Clear Politics average of polls now has him leading Republican Marco Rubio by nearly 4 percentage points -- though a recent Rasmussen poll showed Rubio up by 2 points . \nDemocrat Kendrick Meeks continues to trail in general election matchups . \nThe impact of the spill on the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana is a little more fuzzy . \nOn one hand , it 's allowed Sen. David Vitter to steer clear of questions about his connection to the D.C. Madam scandal and a longtime aide with a lengthy criminal history . \nHe uses his interviews and public appearances to slam the Obama administration over its drilling moratorium and response effort . \nBut the spill has also given Democratic challenger Rep. Charlie Melancon exposure statewide . \n`` The oil spill has given Charlie Melancon a chance to showcase his leadership skills , '' said Kevin Franck , spokesman for the Louisiana Democratic Party . \n`` The most stark contrast Louisianans have seen during the oil spill is Charlie Melancon has been able to actually deliver results and David Vitter has been relegated to complaining loudly . '' \nFranck pointed to Melancon 's efforts getting a mobile health unit for clean-up workers and pushing a bill to make small business loans more affordable for spill victims . \nHe said the oil spill has been bad for Vitter 's image , accusing the senator of sticking up for BP by pushing measures that could limit the firm 's compensation liability for Gulf residents . \nVitter pushed a bill that would tie BP 's liability to its profits -- the senator claimed that could be as high as $ 20 billion , though Franck said given BP 's losses it would be far less than what Gulf Coast residents need . \nMelancon also drew some attention in May when he got choked up at a subcommittee hearing about the Gulf oil spill damage on Capitol Hill . \nThough most recent polls have shown Vitter well ahead in general election match-ups , internal polling from the Melancon campaign shows the race a dead heat with Vitter leading by just 1 percentage point . \nThe internal polling showed Melancon 's image generally improving among those surveyed in recent weeks . \nVitter spokesman Luke Bolar , though , highlighted the senator 's efforts to fight the administration 's drilling moratorium and dismissed Melancon 's performance . \n`` The people of Louisiana know Senator Vitter has been a strong leader throughout this disaster and a desperate political opponent , Charlie Melancon who gave Obama an ` A ' for his job performance , is n't helping bring back the 150,000 jobs that Obama 's moratorium will cost Louisiana 's economy , '' he said in an e-mail . \nGoide said the internal poll seems like an outlier . \nHe said it does n't yet appear Melancon has gained much traction from the spill . \nHe said the fact that a Democratic president is in the White House ties Melancon 's hands , preventing him getting too tough on the administration and effectively ceding that role to Vitter . \nGoidel said Jindal 's challenge will be to sustain his restored image after the leak is plugged and after the spill is cleaned up . \n`` That 's what he 's got to think about , '' Goidel said . \n`` Your shelf life of being the hot thing in politics is not particularly long .

'' \nSalazar has ordered immediate inspections of all 30 deep-water drilling rigs and 47 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` This operation is underway and will be targeted inspections ensuring that -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- tests have been completed and those records are available for inspection , '' the e-mail continued . \n`` We are also verifying that emergency well control exercises are taking place . \n-LRB- U.S. Minerals Management Services -RRB- inspectors should complete these inspections within seven days . \nOnce drilling rig inspections are complete , we will start immediately on inspecting all deep-water production platforms . '' \nAlong with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Salazar was traveling to the Gulf Coast on Friday to inspect ongoing operations and to evaluate the environmental impact of the April 20 explosion . \nThe officials will conduct an aerial tour of the affected area and meet with federal , state and local officials leading the response effort . \nDHS officials declined to comment on the cause of the blast and referred to DOI 's statement . \nBut Elmer Danenberger , who retired in January as the head of offshore regulatory affairs for the U.S. Minerals Management Service , said the investigation into one of the biggest oil spills in U.S. history will center around what happened just before the blast , as workers finished pumping cement between the well pipe and a hole bored into the ocean floor . \nThe process is intended to prevent oil and natural gas from escaping , he said . \n`` That 's what -LRB- investigators -RRB- said the operation was just prior to the blast , '' Danenberger said . \n`` Now , how much prior we do n't know . \nInvestigators will be all over those issues . '' \nDanenberger said it appears `` to be the consensus '' among drilling experts that a poor cementing job probably led to the blowout -- when oil and natural gas exit a well with extreme force . \n`` They 're going to be focusing on the root cause , how the oil and gas were able to enter the -LRB- well -RRB- that should 've been secured , '' he said . \n`` That will be the primary focus , how the influx got in to the -LRB- well -RRB- . '' \nCementing operations could benefit from additional inspection standards , Danenberger said , adding that cementing incidents remain too common . \nAccording to a 2007 study by three U.S. Minerals Management Service officials , cementing was a factor in 18 of 39 well blowouts in the Gulf during a 14-year period , making it the single largest factor , the Wall Street Journal reported . \nEquipment failure and pipe failure were the next leading factors . \n`` There has been a history of gas influxes during cementing operations , so that is an area of concern , but nothing is confirmed , '' Danenberger said . \n`` But perhaps additional standards are necessary for cementing operations . '' \nMeanwhile , critics of British Petroleum say that cost-cutting measures by the London-based oil giant helped to contribute to the rig explosion . \nTom Bower , author of the 2009 book `` The Squeeze , Oil , Money and Greed in the 21st Century , '' told Fox News that British Petroleum 's economizing led to a lack of engineers , an overdependence on outsourcing and a lack of supervisors to keep an eye on subcontractors . \nTransocean Ltd. , which operated the rig on lease from BP , has said Halliburton Co. had finished cementing the 18,000-foot well shortly before the explosion . \nBP has said while it assumes responsibility for the incident , the company is still waiting for an investigation to show Transocean 's role in the matter . \nIn a statement released late Thursday , BP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company was increasing cleaning efforts along the shorelines of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nIn addition to 180,000 feet of boom already in the coastal waters , an additional 300,000 feet is staged or in the process of being deployed . \n`` We are doing absolutely everything in our power to eliminate the source of the leak and contain the environmental impact of the spill , '' Heyward 's statement read . \n`` We are determined to fight this spill on all fronts , in the deep waters of the Gulf , in the shallow waters and , should it be necessary , on the shore . '' \nIn a statement released Friday , Halliburton confirmed it performed a variety of services on the rig and had four employees stationed there at the time of the accident . \n`` Halliburton had completed the cementing of the final production casing string in accordance with the well design approximately 20 hours prior to the incident , '' the statement read . \n`` The cement slurry design was consistent with that utilized in other similar applications .

'' \nAt least 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled so far , according to Coast Guard estimates . \nOne expert said Friday the volume of oil leaking from the well could actually be much higher than that and that even more may escape if the remaining drill equipment erodes further . \n`` Clearly , the sort of occurrence that we 've seen on the Deepwater Horizon is clearly unprecedented , '' BP spokesman David Nicholas told The Associated Press on Friday . \n`` It 's something that we have not experienced before ... a blowout at this depth . '' \nRobert Wiygul , an Ocean Springs , Miss.-based environmental lawyer and board member for the Gulf Restoration Network , said he does n't see anything in the document that suggests BP addressed the kind of technology needed to control a spill at that depth of water . \n`` The point is , if you 're going to be drilling in 5,000 feet of water for oil , you should have the ability to control what you 're doing , '' he said . \nAmid increased fingerpointing Friday , high winds and choppy seas frustrated efforts to hold back the giant oil spill seeping into Louisiana 's rich fishing grounds and nesting areas , while the government desperately cast about for new ideas for dealing with the growing environmental crisis . \nPresident Barack Obama halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . \nThe seas were too rough and the winds too strong Friday to burn off the oil , suck it up effectively with skimmer vessels , or hold it in check with the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast . \nThe floating barriers broke loose in the choppy water , and waves sent oily water lapping over them . \n`` It just ca n't take the wave action , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish . \nThe spill -- a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide -- threatens hundreds of species of wildlife , including birds , dolphins and the fish , shrimp , oysters and crabs that make the Gulf Coast one of the nation 's most abundant sources of seafood . \nLouisiana closed some fishing grounds and oyster beds because of the risk of oil contamination . \nMany of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed in the wake of the explosion claim it was caused when workers for oil services contractor Halliburton Inc. improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . \nAccording to a 2007 study by the federal Minerals Management Service , which examined the 39 rig blowouts in the Gulf of Mexico between 1992 and 2006 , cementing was a contributing factor in 18 of the incidents . \nIn all the cases , gas seepage occurred during or after cementing of the well casing , the MMS said . \nWhile the amount of oil in the Gulf already threatened to make it the worst U.S. oil disaster since the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 , one expert emphasized that it was impossible to know just how much oil had already escaped into the Gulf and that it could be much more than what BP and the Coast Guard have said . \nEven at current estimates , the spill could surpass that of the Exxon Valdez supertanker -- which leaked 11 million gallons -- in just two months . \nIan D. MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University , said estimates from both Coast Guard charts and satellite images indicate that 8 million to 9 million gallons had spilled by April 28 . \n`` I hope I 'm wrong . \nI hope there 's less oil out there than that . \nBut that 's what I get when I apply the numbers , '' he said . \nCoast Guard Admiral Mary Landry brushed off a question during a news conference about estimates that suggested the rate of the leak was five times larger than official estimates . \n`` I would caution you not to get fixated on an estimate of how much is out there , '' Landry said . \n`` The most important thing is from Day One we stood corralling resources from a worst-case scenario working back . '' \nDoug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said it 's impossible to measure the flow . \nBut he said remote cameras show the rate does n't appear to have changed since the leak was discovered . \n`` This is highly imprecise , highly imprecise , '' Suttles said . \n`` We continue to respond to a much more significant case so that we 're prepared for that in the eventuality that the rate is higher . '' \nAs of Friday , only a sheen of oil from the edges of the slick was washing up at Venice , La. , and other extreme southeastern portions of Louisiana . \nBut several miles out , the normally blue-green gulf waters were dotted with sticky , pea - to quarter-sized brown beads with the consistency of tar . \nHigh seas were in the forecast through Sunday and could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds , creeks and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . \nWith the wind blowing from the south , the mess could reach the Mississippi , Alabama and Florida coasts by Monday . \nIn Louisiana , officials opened gates in the Mississippi River hoping a flood of fresh water would drive oil away from the coast . \nBut winds thwarted that plan , too . \nFor days , crews have struggled without success to activate the well 's underwater shutoff valve using remotely operated vehicles . \nThey are also drilling a relief well in hopes of injecting mud and concrete to seal off the leak , but that could take three months . \nU.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he has pressed BP to work more efficiently to clean the spill and has pledged that `` those responsible will be held accountable . '' \nPresident Barack Obama has ordered Salazar to report to him within 30 days on what new technology is needed to tighten safeguards against deepwater drilling spills . \nWith the government and BP running out of options , Salazar has invited other companies to bring their expertise to the table . \nBP likewise sought ideas from some of its rivals and planned to use at least one of them Friday -- applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface . \nThat has never been attempted at such depths . \nAnimal rescue operations have ramped up , including the one at Fort Jackson , about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans . \nThat rescue crew had its first patient Friday , a bird covered in thick , black oil . \nThe bird , a young northern gannet found offshore , is normally white with a yellow head . \nAnd volunteers have converged on the coast to offer help . \nValerie Gonsoulin , a 51-year-old kayaker from Lafayette who wore an `` America 's Wetlands '' hat , said she hoped to help spread containment booms . \n`` I go out in the marshes three times a week . \nIt 's my peace and serenity , '' she said . \n`` I 'm horrified . \nI 've been sitting here watching that NASA image grow , and it grows . \nI knew it would hit every place I fish and love .

{"id": "1818", "time": "2010-04-30", "text": "MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- Oil from a massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico oozed into Louisiana 's ecologically rich wetlands Friday as storms threatened to frustrate desperate protection efforts . \nThe White House put a hold on any new offshore oil projects until safeguards are in place to prevent rig explosions like the one that caused the spill . \nBoats patrolled coastal marshes early Friday looking for areas where the oil has flowed in , the Coast Guard said , and the state of Louisiana diverted thousands of gallons of fresh water from the Mississippi River to try to flush out the wetlands , though that effort was being hampered by wind . \nThe National Weather Service predicted winds , high tides and waves through Sunday that could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . \nSeas of 6 to 7 feet were pushing tides several feet above normal toward the coast , compounded by thunderstorms expected in the area Friday . \nAn animal rescue operation at Fort Jackson , about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans , had its first patient Friday , a young northern gannett found offshore . \nThe bird is normally white with a yellow head and long , pointed beak but was covered in thick , black oil . \nWorkers with Delaware-based Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research used Dawn blue dishwashing soap to scrub it . \nVolunteers started arriving in Venice , La. , though there was n't much for them to do because the weather was so bad . \nAbout two dozen workers in hard hats and lifejackets were stuck on shore at a marina , lounging on small work boats , some laden with boom , ready to go to work . \nSome smoked cigarettes and spat sunflower seeds as they waited for assignments . \nVolunteer Valerie Gonsoulin , a 51-year-old kayaker from Lafayette who wore an `` America 's Wetlands '' hat , said she hoped to help spread containment booms to hold back the oil . \n`` I go out in the marshes three times a week . \nIt 's my peace and serenity , '' she said . \n`` I 'm horrified . \n... I 've been sitting here watching that NASA image grow and it grows . \nI knew it would hit every place I fish and love . '' \nPresident Barack Obama on Friday directed that no new offshore oil drilling leases be issued unless rigs have new safeguards . \nObama ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technologies are needed . \n`` We are making sure any leases going forward have those safeguards , '' said Obama at a White House Rose Garden event . \nHe recently lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas , including the Atlantic and Gulf . \nMeanwhile , the Pentagon approved the use of two Air Force planes to dump chemicals on the oil spill , which civilian planes have already been doing . \nThe Navy also sent equipment for the cleanup , and Pentagon officials were talking with the Department of Homeland Security to figure out what other help the military could give . \nObama reassured Gulf Coast communities that the federal government is `` fully prepared '' to meet its responsibilities to them as the spill gets worse . \nThe leak from a blown-out well a mile underwater is five times bigger than first believed . \nMore than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the site of the rig , which was operated by BP and owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nIt sank two days after the explosion . \nThe Coast Guard is working with BP to deploy floating booms , skimmers and chemical dispersants , and has set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water 's surface . \nFaint fingers of oily sheen began reaching the Mississippi River delta late Thursday , lapping the Louisiana shoreline in long , thin lines . \nThicker oil was farther offshore . \nOfficials have said they would do everything to keep the Mississippi River open to traffic . \nThe Coast Guard defended the federal response so far . \nAsked on all three network television morning shows Friday whether the government has done enough to push oil company BP PLC to plug the underwater leak and protect the coast , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice-O'Hara said the response led by the Coast Guard has been rapid , sustained and has adapted as the threat grew . \nBrice-O'Hara was also asked on ABC 's '' Good Morning America '' about the possibility of dispersing chemicals about a mile beneath the surface to break up oil . \nShe replied : `` That is a technology that is in new stages . \nWe are working closely with our scientific support from NOAA , and there will be careful scrutiny . \nBut if it has applicability , which we think it does , we want to get that in place very quickly . '' \nThe oil slick could become the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades , threatening to eclipse even the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the Exxon Valdez , the grounded tanker that leaked 11 million gallons in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . \nThe sheen measured about 70 miles by 130 miles as of Thursday , and officials expected to update that figure Friday . \nIt imperils hundreds of species of fish , birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast , one of the world 's richest seafood grounds , teeming with shrimp , oysters and other marine life . \n`` This is a very , very big thing , '' David Kennedy , of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told The Associated Press about the spill . \n`` And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it , especially if it continues on , are just mind-boggling . '' \nVolunteers were preparing to help wildlife that might be affected . \nOil clumps seabirds ' feathers , leaving them without insulation -- and when they preen , they swallow it . \nProlonged contact with the skin can cause burns , said Nils Warnock , a spill recovery supervisor with the California Oiled Wildlife Care Network at the University of California-Davis . \nOil swallowed by animals can cause anemia , hemorrhaging and other problems , said Jay Holcomb , executive director of the International Bird Rescue Research Center in California . \nBP shares continued falling early Friday . \nShares were down 2 percent in early trading on the London Stock Exchange , a day after dropping 7 percent in London . \nIn New York on Thursday , BP shares fell $ 4.78 to close at $ 52.56 , taking the fall in the company 's market value to about $ 25 billion since the explosion . \nBP has requested more resources from the Defense Department , especially underwater equipment that might be better than what is commercially available . \nA BP executive said the corporation would `` take help from anyone . '' \nThat includes fishermen who could be hired to help deploy containment boom . \nThe Coast Guard and BP have at least six remotely operated vehicles working to close an underwater valve meant to keep the oil from reaching the surface . \nMeanwhile , crews are drilling a relief well that will essentially suck the oil away from the original well , decreasing the pressure and slowing the leak , though that could take up to three months . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and asked the federal government if he could call up 6,000 National Guard troops to help . \nFlorida Gov. Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency for the state 's Panhandle . \n"}
{"id": "1860", "time": "2010-04-30", "text": "April 29 : Oil from the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico can be seen as a dark blue swirl advancing toward the Louisiana coast . \nESA As oil from the gigantic spill in the Gulf of Mexico reaches U.S. beaches , scientists warn that the potential long-term effects of the massive disaster are hard to gauge -- but potentially disastrous for some local species . \nThe Exxon Valdez disaster is a similar and telling example . \nAmong the worst oil spills ever , the tanker dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in March 1989 . \nTwo decades later , there are still an estimated 21,000 gallons of that oil just below the surface . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently dug 9,000 holes over hundreds of miles of shoreline to ascertain just how much oil was still hanging around . \nNOAA found Valdez oil in about half of those holes . \n`` Despite spending $ 2 billion dollars and using every known clean-up method there was , they recovered 8 percent of the spilled Exxon Valdez oil , '' Jeffrey Short , Pacific science director for Washington , D.C. conservation organization Oceana told LiveScience . \n`` That is typical of these exercises when you have a large marine oil spill . \nYou 're doing really great if you -LRB- get -RRB- 20 percent . '' \nYet despite the lingering oil , many local species recovered : 10 recovered completely , 19 are still recovering , and only two never came back , including the local herring . \nScientists at the University of California-Davis , which manages California 's Oiled Wildlife Care Network , point out that should the oil hit shore , it could have a serious , long-term impact on marine seabirds , such as brown pelicans . \nThe Mississippi Flyway is a critical thoroughfare for migratory birds , and is now experiencing its peak migratory period , said Michael Ziccardi , an associate professor of clinical wildlife health at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center and director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network . \nData is limited on the long term effects of oil on wildlife , but Ziccardi pointed out that after the Valdez disaster , two killer whale pods lost approximately 40 percent of their numbers . \nSince that time , the reproductive capacity of these pods has been reduced by the loss of females , and only about half of newborn calves are surviving . \nGeorge Crozier , executive director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , worried about the potential long term effect on coastal marsh lands as well . \n`` If they let it come into the passes , and if they do n't protect the marshes , it will cause long-term economic loss for years , because there 's no way to clean it , '' he said . \n`` They can talk about spraying micro-organisms on the marsh that may help it recover a little faster , but you ca n't spray grass beds and oyster reefs . '' \n`` It 's an accepted fact that the marshes of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- the Fertile Crescent -- produce 90 percent of the seafood in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Crozier told the Mississippi Press . \n`` If you were to pave that over with an oil spill , you 'd see a dramatic drop in seafood recruitment , possibly for years to come . '' \nAs authorities and BP work frantically to clear up the oil and prevent further from leaking , the question of how long it will remain in the environment becomes a factor in determining the oil 's long-term effect . \nOil that does n't get skimmed up or burned off disperses naturally , according to U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Cory Mendenhall . \nHe told LiveScience that `` It eventually breaks up and evaporates . \nThere are different ways , but we 're told it just kind of goes away . '' \nThe rate of dispersal depends on the type of oil . \nInitial reports suggested the oil leaking into the Gulf was standard Louisiana crude , which biodegrades pretty well , according to Edward Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . \nBut sample testing revealed that the leaking oil was different , with a very high concentration of components that do n't degrade easily , called asphaltenes . \nOne Year Later , Images of Gulf Oil Spill From Space Still Powerful Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}
{"id": "54", "time": "2010-07-17", "text": "July 16 : Workboats operate near BP 's Transocean Development Drilling Rig II at the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP NEW ORLEANS -- The waiting game continued Saturday morning as engineers kept vigil over the massive cap holding back oil from BP 's busted Gulf well , their eyes glued to monitors in a faraway control room that displayed pressure readings , temperature gauges and underwater images . \nTheir round-the-clock work deciphering a puzzle of data from undersea robots and instruments at the wellhead is helping BP and the government determine whether the cap is holding tight as the end of a critical 48-hour testing window approaches . \nSigns so far have been promising but inconclusive . \nSaturday afternoon will mark two full days since BP stopped the oil from leaking into the Gulf and entered into the pressure-testing phase . \nAt that point engineers could offer more definitive evidence that the cap is working , or call for more testing . \nAt any time before then , they could also reopen the cap and allow some oil to spill into the sea again . \nScientists are watching for leaks either in the well itself or the sea floor . \nKent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said on an evening conference call that engineers had found no indication that the well has started leaking underground . \n`` No news is good news , I guess that 's how I 'd say it , '' Wells said . \nOne mysterious development was that the pressure readings were not rising as high as expected , said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \nAllen said two possible reasons were being debated by scientists : The reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower three months into the spill . \nOr there could be an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . \nAllen ordered further study but remained confident . \n`` This is generally good news , '' he said . \nBut he cautioned , `` We need to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that can not be reversed . '' \nInside BP 's command center hundreds of miles away in Houston , engineers , scientists and technicians have been carefully monitoring reams of data around the clock , BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , told The Associated Press Friday . \nOther engineers watched on monitors aboard ships at sea . \n`` You 've got a very , very focused group of people because this is very important , '' Suttles said . \nAsked if people are nervous , knowing the whole world is watching and government officials are sitting with them to monitor their work , Suttles replied : `` I would n't say they are nervous . \nI would use the word focused . '' \nThroughout the day , no one was declaring victory -- or failure . \nPresident Barack Obama cautioned the public `` not to get too far ahead of ourselves , '' warning of the danger of new leaks `` that could be even more catastrophic . '' \nEven if the cap passes the test , more uncertainties lie ahead : Where will the oil already spilled go ? \nHow long will it take to clean up the coast ? \nWhat will happen to the region 's fishermen ? \nAnd will life on the Gulf Coast ever be the same again ? \nOn Thursday , BP closed the vents on the new , tight-fitting cap and finally stopped crude from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since the April 20 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed the spill 5,000 feet down . \nWith the cap working like a giant cork to keep the oil inside the well , scientists kept watch in case the buildup of pressure underground caused new leaks in the well pipe and in the surrounding bedrock that could make the disaster even worse . \nPressure readings after 24 hours were about 6,700 pounds per square inch and rising slowly , Allen said , below the 7,500 psi that would clearly show the well was not leaking . \nHe said pressure continued to rise between 2 and 10 psi per hour . \nA low pressure reading , or a falling one , could mean the oil is escaping . \nBut Allen said a seismic probe of the surrounding sea floor found no sign of a leak in the ground . \nBenton F. Baugh , president of Radoil Inc. in Houston and a National Academy of Engineering member who specializes in underwater oil operations , warned that the pressure readings could mean that an underground blowout could occur . \nHe said the oil coming up the well may be leaking out underground and entering a geological pocket that might not be able to hold it . \nBut Roger N. Anderson , a professor of marine geology and geophysics at Columbia University , said the oil pressure might be rising slowly not because of a leak , but because of some kind of blockage in the well . \n`` If it 's rising slowly , that means the pipe 's integrity 's still there . \nIt 's just getting around obstacles , '' he said . \nHe added that `` any increase in pressure is good , not bad . '' \nThe cap is designed to prevent oil from spilling into the Gulf , either by keeping it bottled up in the well , or by capturing it and piping it to ships on the surface . \nIt is not yet clear which way the cap will be used if it passes the pressure test . \nEither way , the cap is a temporary measure until a relief well can be completed and mud and cement can be pumped into the broken well deep underground to seal it more securely than the cap . \nThe first of the two relief wells being drilled could be done by late July or August . \nIn a positive sign , work on the relief wells resumed Friday . \nThe project had been suspended earlier this week for fear that the capping of the well could interfere with it . \nThere was no end in sight to the cleanup in the water and on shore . \nSomewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nIn Orange Beach , Ala. , long strands of white absorbent boom strung along the shore were stained chocolate brown after a fresh wave of BB-size tar balls washed up . \nCharter boat captains who ca n't fish because of the spill patrolled the shore , looking for oil slicks . \nFishing guides spent their time ferrying Coast Guard personnel . \nA flotilla of fishing boats operating as skimmers plied the waters across the Gulf . \nLarge sections of the Gulf Coast have been closed to fishing and shellfish harvesting . \nMany fishermen have been hired out by BP to do cleanup work . \nCade Thomas , a 38-year-old fishing guide from Pine , La. , said the whole mentality of the place is different . \n`` It 's all changed dramatically . \nThe fishing stories are n't there , '' he said . \n`` There 's no stories to tell except where we went to today and how much oil we saw . '' \nIn Grand Isle , La. , most of the summer rental cottages are vacant , tables at the single high-end seafood restaurant are empty , and souvenir shops are barely doing enough business to pay the bills . \nA hand-painted sign along the main road rechristens the tourist town `` Grand Oil . '' \nFolks are grateful the gusher has been stopped , but many say it is too late to save this summer . \nThousands of tourists have gone elsewhere . \nScientists can not say for certain what the long-term environmental effect will be . \nBut long after the well is finally plugged , oil could still be washing up in marshes and on beaches as tar balls or patties . \nThere is also fear that months from now , those tar balls could move west to Corpus Christi , Texas , or travel up and around Florida to Miami or North Carolina 's Outer Banks . \nCapping the well was a milestone in the long catastrophe , but people should n't let their guards down , said Billy Nungesser , the president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the hardest hit areas along the Gulf . \nWeber reported from Houston . \nAssociated Press Writers Holbrook Mohr , Vicki Smith , Shelia Byrd , Jay Reeves , Matt Sedensky , Kevin McGill , and Ramit Plushnick-Masti contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "1126", "time": "2010-07-10", "text": "June 13 : The surface of the Gulf of Mexico glistens with color as light reflects off the oil sheen at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nNEW ORLEANS -- Robotic submarines working a mile underwater removed a leaking cap from the gushing Gulf oil well Saturday , starting a painful trade-off : Millions more gallons of crude will flow freely into the sea for at least two days until a new seal can be mounted to capture all of it . \nThere 's no guarantee for such a delicate operation deep below the water 's surface , officials said , and the permanent fix of plugging the well from the bottom remains slated for mid-August . \n`` It 's not just going to be , you put the cap on , it 's done . \nIt 's not like putting a cap on a tube of toothpaste , '' Coast Guard spokesman Capt. James McPherson said . \nRobotic submarines removed the cap that had been placed on top of the leak in early June to collect the oil and send it to surface ships for collection or burning . \nBP aims to have the new , tighter cap in place as early as Monday and said that , as of Saturday night , the work was going according to plan . \nIf tests show it can withstand the pressure of the oil and is working , the Gulf region could get its most significant piece of good news since the April 20 explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . \n`` Over the next four to seven days , depending on how things go , we should get that sealing cap on . \nThat 's our plan , '' said Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , of the round-the-clock operation . \nIt would be only a temporary solution to the catastrophe that the federal government estimates has poured between 87 million and 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf as of Saturday . \nHope for permanently plugging the leak lies with two relief wells , the first of which should be finished by mid-August . \nWith the cap removed Saturday at 12:37 p.m. CDT , oil flowed freely into the water , collected only by the Q4000 surface vessel , with a capacity of about 378,000 gallons . \nThat vessel should be joined Sunday by the Helix Producer , which has more than double the Q4000 's capacity . \nBut the lag could be long enough for as much as 5 million gallons to gush into already fouled waters . \nOfficials said a fleet of large skimmers was scraping oil from the surface above the well site . \nThe process begun Saturday has two major phases : removing equipment currently on top of the leak and installing new gear designed to fully contain the flow of oil . \nBP began trying Saturday afternoon to remove the bolted top flange that only partially completed the seal with the old cap . \nVideo images showed robotic arms working to unscrew its bolts . \nWells said that could last into Monday depending on whether the flange can be pulled off from above , as BP hopes . \nIf not , a specially designed tool will be used to pry apart the top and bottom flanges . \nOnce the top flange is removed , BP has to bind together two sections of drill pipe that are in the gushing well head . \nThen a 12-foot-long piece of equipment called a flange transition spool will be lowered and bolted over it . \nThe second piece of pipe inside the well head came as something of a surprise , and raises the possibility that one of the sections of pipe became jammed in the Deepwater Horizon 's blowout preventer , though which the well pipes run . \nThe failure of the blowout preventer , a massive piece of equipment designed to stop the unchecked flow of oil , is partly to blame for the size of the spill . \n`` That will be an important question to ask when we pull the blowout preventer up to the surface and we 'll figure out where that pipe ultimately landed , '' Wells said . \nAfter the flange transition spool is bolted in place , the new cap -- called a capping stack or `` Top Hat 10 '' -- can be lowered . \nThe equipment , weighing some 150,000 pounds , is designed to fully seal the leak and provide connections for new vessels on the surface to collect oil . \nThe cap has valves that can restrict the flow of oil and shut it in , if it can withstand the enormous pressure . \nThat will be one of the key items for officials to monitor , said Paul Bommer , a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin . \n`` If the new cap does work and they shut the well in , it is possible that part of the well could rupture if the pressure inside builds to an unacceptable value , '' Bommer wrote in an e-mail Saturday . \nUltimately , BP wants to have four vessels collecting oil within two or three weeks of the new cap 's installation . \nIf the new cap does n't work , BP is ready to place a backup similar the old one on top of the leak . \nThe government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons of oil a day are spewing from the well , and the previous cap collected about 1 million gallons of that . \nWith the new cap and the new containment vessel , the system will be capable of capturing 2.5 million to 3.4 million gallons -- essentially all the leaking oil , officials said . \nThe plan , which was accelerated to take advantage of a window of good weather lasting seven to 10 days , did n't inspire confidence in the residents of the oil-slicked coast . \n`` This is probably the sixth or seventh method they 've tried , so , no , I 'm not optimistic , '' said Deano Bonano , director of emergency preparedness for Jefferson Parish . \nOn Saturday he was inspecting beaches at Grand Isle lined with protective boom and bustling with heavy equipment used to scoop up and clean stained sand . \n`` Even if they turn it off today , we 'll still be here at least another six weeks , on watch for the oil , '' he said .

'' \nWorkers stopped pumping mud in after about eight hours of their `` static kill '' procedure and were monitoring the well to ensure it remained stable , BP said . \n`` The well pressure is now being controlled by the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling mud , the desired outcome of the static kill procedure , '' the company said in a statement . \nBP spokeswoman Sheila Williams said , `` It 's a milestone . \nIt 's a step toward the killing of the well . '' \nThe next step would be deciding whether to cement the well , Williams said . \nThe pressure in the well dropped quickly in the first 90 minutes of the static kill procedure Tuesday , a sign that everything was going as planned , wellsite leader Bobby Bolton told AP . \nBolton said Tuesday night that the procedure was going well . \n`` Pressure is down and appears to be stabilizing , '' he told the AP then . \nBut the mud that was forced down the broken wellhead to permanently plug the gusher is only half the story . \nTo call the mission a success , crews working on a flotilla of vessels on a desolate patch of water need to seal off the well from two directions . \nThe static kill -- also known as bullheading -- involved slowly pumping the mud from a ship down lines running to the top of the ruptured well a mile below . \nBP has said that may be enough by itself to seal the well . \nStill , an 18,000-foot relief well that BP has been drilling for the past three months will be used later this month to execute a `` bottom kill , '' in which mud and cement will be injected into the bedrock 21\\/2 miles below the sea floor to finish the job , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . \n`` There should be no ambiguity about that , '' Allen said . \n`` I 'm the national incident commander , and this is how this will be handled . '' \nA 75-ton cap placed on the well in July has been keeping the oil bottled up inside over the past three weeks , but that is considered only a temporary measure . \nBP and the Coast Guard want to plug up the hole with a column of heavy drilling mud and cement to seal it off more securely . \nBefore the cap was lowered onto the well , 172 million gallons of crude flowed into the sea , unleashed by the April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers . \nA previous , similar effort failed in May when the mud could n't overcome the unstemmed flow of oil . \nBP wo n't know for certain whether the static kill has succeeded until engineers can use the soon-to-be-completed relief well to check their work . \nThe task is becoming more urgent because peak hurricane season is just around the corner , Allen said . \nTropical Storm Colin formed then dissipated far out in the Atlantic on Tuesday , but early forecasts say it will travel toward the East Coast rather than the Gulf . \n"}

'' \nHere 's a look at what the president and administration have been doing every day since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , triggering the massive spill . \nThe following daily updates are based on a review of White House schedules , news releases and news coverage and do not cover every activity in the Gulf or in Washington : In the Gulf : BP claimed a key milestone Wednesday in the effort to plug its blown-out well as a government report said much of the spilled oil is gone , heartening officials who have taken heat during the tricky cleanup but leaving some Gulf Coast residents still skeptical . \nBP reported that mud forced down the well overnight was pushing the crude back down to its source for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nAnd a federal report being released Wednesday indicated that only about a quarter of the spilled oil remains in the Gulf , with the rest having been contained , cleaned up or otherwise disappeared . \nAt the White House : President Obama applauded the headway that has been made to stop the worst U.S. oil spill , telling union officials in Washington that the Gulf of Mexico operation is `` finally close to coming to an end . '' \nHe said people 's lives `` have been turned upside down '' as a result of the April 20 BP oil spill , but said he was heartened by indications the spill is , at last , being brought under control . \nIn the Gulf : Crews prepared to pump mud into the blown-out well , provided a test on the process is successful . \nMeanwhile , BP announced it had created a new team to accelerate compensation to Gulf businesses . \nAt the White House : President Obama signed a law reducing disparities between crack and cocaine prison sentences . \nHe was hosting a meeting with `` young African leaders '' in the East Room of the White House Tuesday afternoon . \nIn the Gulf : Crews prepared to test whether they could move forward with a plan to pump mud and other material into the blown-out well on the Gulf of Mexico floor . \nThe process known as a `` static kill '' was being considered as BP neared completion on a pair of relief wells , long seen as the way to choke off the leak for good . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered a speech in Atlanta outlining his commitment to ending the war in Iraq . \nIn the Gulf : Congressional investigators said the Coast Guard routinely approved requests made by BP to use chemical dispersants to break up the oil slicks in the Gulf despite a federal order to use the chemicals sparingly . \nAt the White House : President Obama played basketball with White House staff members at Fort McNair . \nIn the Gulf : Tropical Storm Bonnie left crews working to plug the Gulf oil gusher a little memento that is expected to push their work back about a day . \nCrews found debris in the bottom of the relief well that ultimately will be used to plug the leak for good , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday . \nThe government 's point man on the spill said the sediment settled in the relief well last week when crews popped in a plug to keep it safe ahead of Bonnie . \nAt the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . \nIn the Gulf : BP 's new boss says it 's time for a `` scaleback '' in cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nFederal officials say there is no way the crude could reach the East Coast . \nAnd fishing areas are starting to reopen . \nThere were several signs Friday that the era of thousands of oil-skimming boats and hazmat-suited beach crews is giving way to long-term efforts to clean up , compensate people for their losses and understand the damage wrought . \nLocal fishermen are doubtful , however , and say oil remains a bigger problem than BP and the federal government are letting on . \nOther people contend the impact of the spill has been overblown , given that little oil remains on the Gulf surface , but Bob Dudley , who heads BP 's oil spill recovery and will take over as CEO in October , rejected those claims . \nAt the White House : President Obama headed to the heart of the U.S. auto industry to push an important election-year claim : his administration 's unpopular auto industry bailout has turned into an economic good-news story . \nIn the Gulf : Even when the oily sheen starts fading from the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , it manages to become bad news for fishermen . \nMany of those whose fisheries were shut down by the oil spill have found work skimming oil , putting out boom or ferrying cleanup supplies through BP 's Vessels of Opportunity program . \nBut as the crude sinks , evaporates or breaks down , they may be left with nothing to do but wait for their claim checks to arrive and for their fishing grounds to reopen . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered an education reform speech Thursday morning at the National Urban League 's 100th Anniversary Convention in the nation 's capital . \nLater in the morning , the president met with his national security team to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan . \nIn the afternoon , he delivered remarks and signed the Tribal Law and Order Act in the East Room . \nIn the Gulf : With 100 days having passed since the April 20 explosion that triggered the massive leak , oil has mostly stopped collecting at the surface . \nScientists , though , are unsure how much is left and where it all is . \nAt the White House : President Obama was heading to New York City for a taping of `` The View '' and two Democratic fundraisers . \nIn the Gulf : BP named its first American CEO , Robert Dudley , who is set to replace Tony Hayward on Oct. 1 . \nThe firm also announced a record $ 17 billion loss in the last quarter . \nAt the White House : President Obama spoke in the Rose Garden about the Afghanistan war , addressing the leak of thousands of sensitive documents by the online group Wikileaks . \nIn the Gulf : More details emerged about the future of embattled BP CEO Tony Hayward . \nSky News reported that Hayward will step down from BP 's top post in October and take a job with TNK-BP , the company 's joint venture in Russia . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered a public statement urging GOP senators to clear the way for a vote on Democrat-backed campaign finance legislation . \nIn the Gulf : Reports surfaced that BP CEO Tony Hayward would be replaced , likely by Managing Director Bob Dudley . \nThe move comes after Hayward was persistently criticized for his comments on and handling of the BP spill . \nMeanwhile , crews working to permanently seal the Gulf of Mexico oil leak were back on the scene Sunday after evacuating ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie . \nThough the storm fizzled , crews are working hard to finish a relief well before more bad weather disrupts the procedure . \nAt the White House : President Obama played golf at Andrews Air Force Base . \nIn the Gulf : Ships steamed to safer waters and coastal workers packed up oil removal operations as remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie rolled into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday . \nBy daybreak , all but a handful of the ships working at the well site were expected to be out of the way of the storm . \nThe mechanical cap that has mostly contained the oil for eight days was left closed , and there was no worry the storm could cause any problems with the plug because it 's nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the ocean 's surface . \nAt the White House President Obama has no public events scheduled . \nIn the Gulf : Ships monitoring BP 's broken oil well stood fast Friday as the remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie blew toward the spill site , threatening to force a full evacuation that would leave engineers clueless about whether a makeshift cap on the gusher was holding . \nVessels connected to deep-sea robots equipped with cameras and seismic devices would be among the last to flee and would ride out the rough weather if possible , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . \nAt the White House : President Obama proclaimed a week of `` enormous progress '' in fixing economic problems and cracking down on Wall Street , prodding the Senate to do even more by passing tax credits for small businesses . \nObama went before the cameras to praise a trio of matters he signed into law this week -- an overhaul of financial regulations , an effort to shrink wasteful government payments , and an extension of unemployment benefits for millions of jobless people . \nIn the Gulf : Dozens of ships were preparing Thursday to pull out of the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm brewed in the Caribbean , halting deep-sea efforts to plug BP 's ruptured oil well . \nThough the rough weather was hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- from the spill site , officials ordered technicians to suspend work Wednesday as they would need several days to clear the area . \nThe government 's oil spill chief was waiting to see how the storm developed before deciding whether to order the ships to evacuate . \nAt the White House : President Obama will sign into law a bill that would require U.S. agencies to redouble their efforts to identify and recover billions of dollars lost annually to wasteful spending . \nHe 's also meeting with Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . \nIn the Gulf : Tropical rainstorms moving toward the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday threatened to shut down undersea efforts to seal BP 's ruptured well , interrupting work just as engineers get close to plugging the leak with mud and cement . \nA weather system brewing in the Caribbean prompted crews to temporarily cork a relief tunnel deep beneath the sea floor , BP vice president Kent Wells said Wednesday afternoon . \nThe storm is still hundreds of miles away and may never reach the area , but the oil giant does n't want to risk damaging BP 's best bet at permanently sealing the well . \nAt the White House : President Obama signs financial overhaul bill into law . \nReceives oil spill briefing . \nIn the Gulf : The government 's oil spill chief tried to tamp down fears Tuesday that BP 's capped well is buckling under the pressure , saying that seepage detected along the sea floor less than two miles away is coming from an older well no longer in production . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen also said at least five leaks have been discovered around the well machinery , but he dismissed them as `` very small drips '' -- `` not unlike an oil leak you might have in your car . '' \nAt the White House : President Obama welcomes British Prime Minister David Cameron for his first visit . \nIn the Gulf : After detecting possible seepage near the blown-out well on the Gulf floor , the federal government on Monday allowed BP to keep its new well cap in place for another day . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said the firm is monitoring for any new leaks at the site . \nAt the White House : President Obama , in a morning statement to the press , urged Senate Republicans to support a jobless benefits extension coming up for a vote . \nHe later was hosting the WNBA 's Phoenix Mercury in honor of the team 's 2009 championship . \nIn the Gulf : BP said it wants to keep using a new well cap to prevent any more oil from leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . \nHowever , administration pointman Thad Allen said the day before that the plan was to use the cap to continue pumping oil to the surface after testing is complete . \nAllen will make the final call . \nAt the White House : The Obama family returned to Washington after their vacation in Bar Harbor , Maine . \nIn the Gulf : Engineers kept vigil Saturday over the massive cap holding back oil from BP 's busted Gulf well , their eyes glued to monitors in a faraway control room that displayed pressure readings , temperature gauges and underwater images . \nTheir round-the-clock work deciphering a puzzle of data from undersea robots and instruments at the wellhead is helping BP and the government determine whether the cap is holding tight as the end of a critical 48-hour testing window approaches . \nSigns so far have been promising but inconclusive . \nAt the White House : President Obama is on a family vacation in Maine . \nIn the Gulf : BP says there are no signs that its busted Gulf of Mexico well has started leaking underground more than a day after it was capped . \nKent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said on a Friday evening conference call that engineers are closely monitoring pressure as well as the temperature and sounds around the well . \nAt the White House : Cheered by a key victory in Congress and good news from the Gulf oil spill zone , a relaxed President Obama began a weekend holiday Friday on a sun-dappled mountain peak overlooking the rocky Atlantic coast . \nIn the Gulf : BP says oil from its broken well has stopped gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since April . \nThe announcement Thursday came after company officials said all valves had been shut on a new cap over the busted well in an experiment to stop the spill . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered remarks at a groundbreaking ceremony in Michigan . \nIn the Gulf : As BP waited for the all-clear to resume testing of its new well cap , scientists reportedly found that the spill was beginning the affect the food chain in the Gulf by killing some organisms and triggering others to multiply in the tainted water . \nAt the White House : President Obama was scheduled to attend a meeting about his administration 's cybersecurity efforts . \nHe was set to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and House Democratic leaders later in the day . \nIn the Gulf : BP decided to delay tests on its new well cap after government officials called for more analysis . \nThe oil firm is hoping to use the cap to be able to stop the oil flow for the first time since the April 20 explosion that triggered the leak . \nAt the White House : President Obama unveiled his new strategy for fighting HIV\\/AIDS , calling for reducing new infections by 25 percent over the next five years . \nIn the Gulf : BP planned to attach a new cap on Monday to the blown-out oil well on the Gulf floor . \nAfter attaching the 150,000-pound device , BP planned to test it to see whether it would be able to plug the oil . \nAt the White House : President Obama was hosting Dominican Republican President Leonel Fernandez at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : BP was in the process of replacing a leaking cap with what they claimed would be a better containment system . \nUntil that system is in place , though , oil could be seen spewing out of the hole into the Gulf of Mexico -- BP estimated it would take between three and six days to finish the operation . \nAt the White House : President Obama played golf at Fort Belvoir in Virginia . \nIn the Gulf : Undersea robots manipulated by engineers a mile above will begin work Saturday removing the containment cap over the gushing well head in the Gulf of Mexico to replace it with a tighter-fitting cap that could funnel all the oil to tankers at the surface . \nIf all goes according to plan , the tandem of the tighter cap and the tankers could keep all the oil from polluting the fragile Gulf as soon as Monday . \nBut it 's only a temporary solution . \nIt wo n't plug the busted well , the leak will get worse before it gets better -- and it remains uncertain that it will succeed . \nAs much as 5 million gallons could gush out between the old cap 's removal and the new cap 's installation and connection to a ship . \nAt the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . \nIn the Gulf : The first of two relief wells being drilled to stop the Gulf oil gusher could be done by the end of the month , BP officials say , but if that does n't succeed , one backup being considered is transferring the crude to non-producing underwater wells that are miles away . \nBP would run the flow through pipelines across the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the crisis . \nAt the White House : President Obama is wrapping up a two-day swing through Missouri and Nevada with a speech on clean energy . \nIn the Gulf : A relief well being drilled deep into the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico to shut down the gushing oil well could be completed ahead of a long-set deadline of mid-August only if conditions are ideal . \nNational Incident Commander and retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Thursday that the relief well is expected to intercept and penetrate the Deepwater Horizon well pipe about 18,000 feet -LRB- 5,500 meters -RRB- below sea level within seven to 10 days . \nAt the White House : President Obama traveled to Kansas City , Mo. , to talk about the economy and delivered speeches at back-to-back fundraisers for Senate candidate Robin Carnahan before heading for Las Vegas . \nAt the White House : President Obama will spend part of his day on export promotion as well as the Gulf oil spill . \nIn the morning , Obama will give remarks in the East Room on his administration 's commitment to export promotion to grow the economy and support new American jobs . \nAt midday , he and Vice President Biden will get a briefing in the Oval Office on the oil spill . \nIn the Gulf : Authorities were probing whether tar balls that washed up on the Texas shore came directly from the BP oil spill . \nThe Galveston mayor said he was `` cautiously optimistic '' the contamination was a fluke , and not a sign of more oil to come . \nAt the White House : President Obama met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : Rough weather and rough waters put a hold on testing for a massive Taiwanese oil skimmer , the latest hope for cleaning up millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf . \nMeanwhile , the cost to BP of cleaning up the disaster passed the $ 3 billion mark . \nAt the White House : No public events . \nIn the Gulf : A massive oil skimmer was undergoing testing in the Gulf as BP and the Coast Guard hoped to unleash it on the widespread oil spill . \nThe Taiwanese vessel is billed as the biggest oil skimmer in the world and is the latest hope for cleaning up the millions of gallons of oil that have spewed into the waters . \nAt the White House : President Obama played golf at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in the morning . \nHe was set to make Fourth of July remarks at the White House in the evening . \nIn the Gulf : BP is not hiring nearly enough claims adjusters to keep up with a flood of claims from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , a consultant hired by the state of Louisiana says . \nThe consultant also says the number of checks being sent spiked less than a week after Louisiana put pressure on the company to speed up claims . \nAnd it says the average amount per check peaked when BP gave the state data for large loss claims . \nA BP spokesman did not comment directly about the findings , but asserted the company has responded appropriately . \nAt the White House : President Obama is at Camp David but will return in the evening to get ready for July Fourth celebrations at the White House . \nOn Sunday , the first family hosts military heroes and their families for an Independence Day celebration that includes a barbecue , concert and a view of fireworks from the South Lawn . \nStaff and their families from throughout the administration will also be there . \nThe president will deliver remarks . \nIn the Gulf : BP and several wildlife protection groups are working out the final details of an agreement to resolve a lawsuit alleging turtles were being killed as BP burned oil from its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico , attorneys said Friday . \nThe deal under negotiation calls for biologists or other trained observers to be present whenever oil is burned , looking for any turtles trapped in corrals that BP PLC is using to capture and burn oil on the surface of the water , said plaintiffs ' attorney William Eubanks . \nAt the White House : President Obama traveled to Charleston , WV to attend the state memorial service for Sen. Robert Byrd . \nIn the Gulf : Based on a federal government estimate , the BP spill was expected to become the largest ever in the Gulf by Thursday . \nBy reaching 140 million gallons of leaked oil , it would surpass the prior record set by the Ixtoc I spill three decades ago . \nAt the White House : President Obama was set to deliver a speech calling for a comprehensive immigration package . \nHe was scheduled to receive a briefing on the oil spill later in the afternoon , before welcoming the winners of the Women 's Professional Soccer championship at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : Small skimmers were forced into port for a second day after winds from Hurricane Alex churned up big waves . \nMost cleanup crews ' work was halted , though the government brought in a massive former tanker to take on oil-skimming duties . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered an economic speech and answered questions at a town hall-style meeting in Racine , Wis. . \nIn the Gulf : Concerns continued to grow that Tropical Storm Alex could disrupt cleanup efforts in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe storm was expected to gain hurricane strength later in the day and while its projected course is not near the spill site the waves generated by high winds could make it impossible to use skimmers and boom . \nAt the White House : President Obama was scheduled to meet with senators to discuss climate legislation , before meeting with Saudi Arabian King Abdullah and later members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss immigration . \nIn the Gulf : BP denied a report that CEO Tony Hayward is resigning , as its cleanup costs for the spill reached $ 2.65 billion . \nThe report came from Russia 's RIA Novosti news agency , but BP claimed it was `` definitely not correct . '' \nAt the White House : President Obama received briefings at the Oval Office and met with senior advisers . \nIn the Gulf : Tropical Storm Alex was downgraded to a tropical depression as it hit part of Mexico , but concerns remained that the system could become more severe as it tracked toward the Gulf of Mexico . \nIt was n't expected to hit the site of the spill , but if it changed course or stirred up high winds could grind the clean-up to a halt . \nAt the White House : President Obama held a series of meetings on the economy in Toronto at the G20 summit . \nWorld leaders pledged to cut deficits in half in three years . \nIn the Gulf : Tropical weather gathering strength in the Caribbean could be the latest bad news for BP crews trying to contain and clean up the massive oil spill in the Gulf , an effort that has been plagued with setbacks for more than two months . \nIt is still too early to tell exactly where tropical storm Alex might go how it might affect oil on and below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , forecasters said . \nAt the White House : President Obama finishes up with the G8 meeting in Huntsville and then travels south to Toronto where he will participate in the G20 meeting . \nIn the Gulf : BP claimed that tests show a relief well should be completed by mid-August . \nThe well is considered the best hope for permanently plugging the leaking oil . \nAt the White House : President Obama traveled to Toronto to meet with G8 leaders . \nIn the Gulf : A cap was back in place on BP 's broken oil well after a deep-sea blunder forced crews to temporarily remove what has been the most effective method so far for containing some of the massive Gulf of Mexico spill . \nEngineers using remote-controlled submarines repositioned the cap late Wednesday after it had been off for much of the day . \nIt had captured 700,000 gallons of oil in 24 hours before one of the robots bumped into it late in the morning . \nBob Dudley , BP 's new point man for the oil response , said crews had done the right thing to remove the cap because fluid seemed to be leaking and could have been a safety hazard . \nAt the White House : President Obama held a bilateral meeting and joint news conference with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev . \nIn the Gulf : BP PLC said that managing director Bob Dudley will head the new Gulf Coast Restoration Organization , which is in charge of cleaning up the oil spill . \nDudley wo n't say if the oil giant will resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf , where it 's the largest oil and gas producer . \nDudley says the company will `` step back '' from the issue while investigating the April 20 explosion . \nDudley told the CBS `` Early Show '' he has completed taking over the disaster response and cleanup from CEO Tony Hayward . \nHayward repeatedly sparked criticism from the Gulf to the U.S. Capitol for missteps and insensitive comments . \nAt the White House : The White House has promised an immediate appeal of a federal judge 's reversal of the administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAnd Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he will issue a new order imposing a moratorium that eliminates any doubt it is needed and appropriate . \nJudge Martin Feldman overturned the ban Tuesday , saying the government simply assumed that because one rig exploded , the others pose an imminent danger , too . \nThe Interior Department had imposed the moratorium last month in the wake of the BP disaster , halting approval of any new permits for deepwater projects and suspending drilling on 33 exploratory wells . \nIn the Gulf : The owner of the offshore rig involved in the massive Gulf oil spill sharply criticized the U.S. government 's six-month ban on deepwater drilling . \nTransocean Ltd. president Steven Newman told reporters at an oil industry conference in London that there were things the Obama administration `` could implement today that would allow the industry to go back to work tomorrow without an arbitrary six-month time limit . '' \nAt the White House : President Obama will meet with health insurers and state insurance commissioners at the White House . \nAfterward , he will speak to reporters about the ongoing effort to implement the new health care overhaul law , and the new benefits it affords to families across the country . \nHe 'll deliver his remarks in the East Room . \nIn the evening , Obama will speak to gay activists at the White House . \nVice President Biden will also attend the event . \nIn the Gulf : BP announced that it has spent $ 2 billion so far to tackle the oil spill in the Gulf and compensate victims . \nBP also confirmed to Fox News that the company was shifting responsibility for day-to-day handling of the spill from CEO Tony Hayward -- who has come under fire for his remarks about the spill and most recently for spending the weekend at a yacht race -- to Managing Director Robert Dudley . \nAt the White House : President Obama delivered remarks on fatherhood in Washington , D.C. , before hosting a Father 's Day `` mentoring barbecue '' at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : Louisianans observe a day of prayer over the oil spill . \nAt the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . \nIn the Gulf : As Gulf states struggled to deal with the up to 120 million gallons of oil that have escaped from a blown-out undersea well , BP chief executive Tony Hayward took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race off England 's Isle of Wright . \nIn a statement , BP described Hayward 's day off as `` a rare moment of private time '' and said that `` no matter where he is , he is always in touch with what is happening within BP '' and can direct recovery operations if required . \nAt the White House : President Obama and Vice President Biden went golfing together . \nIn the Gulf : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said an estimated 2,000 private boats in the so-called `` vessels of opportunity '' program will be more closely linked through a tighter command and control structure to direct them to locations less than 50 miles offshore to skim the oil . \nAllen , the point man for the federal response to the spill , previously had said surface containment efforts would be concentrated much farther offshore . \nAt the White House : Kenneth Feinberg , who was chosen by President Obama and BP to oversee a program processing claims from the oil spill , said a plan to handle the remaining damage claims will be in place in 30 to 45 days . \nIn the Gulf : A relief well meant to stanch a gushing flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico is ahead of schedule and could reach its target in three to four weeks , says Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen . \nHe said a rig has drilled nearly 10,000 feet below the seafloor and should be within 10 feet of the existing well within weeks . \nIt will then bore down about 1,000 feet to intersect with the damaged well farther underground . \nAllen says the final push of drilling is the most difficult . \nThe well originally was slated for completion in mid-August . \nOn Capitol Hill : A grim-faced BP chief executive Tony Hayward said Thursday he was `` deeply sorry '' for his company 's catastrophic oil spill . \n`` I understand the seriousness of the situation , the frustrations and fears that continue to be voiced , '' he told a House investigations subcommittee . \nHe also said , `` The fire and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon never should have happened and I 'm deeply sorry that it did . '' \nAnd , while `` we need to know what went wrong '' Hayward also said there is still `` extensive work to do '' before anyone can say what caused the blowout . \nIn the Gulf : Trying to shrink the amount of crude polluting the Gulf of Mexico , BP started burning oil siphoned from the leaking well . \nThe firm was continuing to work after a lightning strike Tuesday started a fire and forced operations to stop for hours . \nAt the White House : President Obama announced that BP has agreed to set up a $ 20 billion account to compensate spill victims following his first meeting with top-level executives . \nBP 's chairman , who publicly apologized for the disaster , also announced that the company would not pay out any more dividends for the rest of the year . \nIn the Gulf : As BP continued to siphon leaking oil to the surface , the company faced new questions about documents turned up by congressional investigators that suggested BP was cutting corners with the Deepwater Horizon well when it came to design and safety measures . \nAt the White House : President Obama was scheduled to tour an emergency resource center in Pensacola , Fla. , where oil has not yet hit the beaches but local officials are preparing . \nThe president was meeting again with Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , before returning to Washington where he planned to deliver his first Oval Office address to the nation . \nIn the Gulf : BP submitted a plan to the Coast Guard to speed up the containment of oil gushing out of the blown-out well . \nUnder the new timeline , BP claims it can capture more than 50,000 barrels a day by the end of June . \nUnder the prior timeline , that target would n't be reached until mid-July . \nThe company said it plans to bring in vessels from Europe and South America to keep on schedule . \nAt the White House : President Obama made his fourth trip to the Gulf Coast to survey the oil spill damage . \nHe landed in Biloxi , Miss. , to meet with local officials before heading to Alabama . \nObama said he was pressing to make sure local residents suffering from economic damages are adequately compensated . \nIn the Gulf : BP was to submit a plan for a faster containment of the oil after it multiplied estimates last week about the number of barrels pouring into the Gulf each day . \nAdm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , said more than 4,000 vessels are in the water trying to help catch the oil . \nThe oil , however , continues to wash ashore in Alabama . \nSensors are also being placed on the sea floor to determine how much oil is being collected . \nAt the White House : The White House announced that President Obama will address the nation on Tuesday night after his return from a two-day trip to the Gulf region . \nThe White House also is planning an escrow fund for BP to contribute money for local businesses . \nIt will be managed by a third party In the Gulf : BP announced it will donate its share of the proceeds generated by selling the oil captured from the well to fund efforts to protect and restore wildlife habitat along the Gulf Coast . \nBut the company has not released specifics on how the fund will work and said it does n't know how much money might be raised . \nYet once the oil is brought to shore , it will creep into the world 's economic supply chain unnoticed by consumers . \nAt the White House : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man for the oil spill , said that since the leak began , 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of crude have been siphoned off the leaking well using tubes and caps . \nAn additional 18 million gallons -LRB- 68 million liters -RRB- have been skimmed from the ocean surface , he said . \nThe skimmed liquid is generally only 10 to 15 percent oil . \nIn the Gulf : The situation turned out to be more dire than previously thought after new scientific estimates were released that showed oil flowing at a rate of up to 2.1 million gallons a day -- more than twice the previous estimate . \nThat means more than 100 million gallons may have already spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . \nAt the White House : President Obama received a briefing on the oil spill , before meeting with small business owners and delivering remarks about his small business initiative . \nThe White House released new details of the president 's upcoming trip to the Gulf , his fourth since the oil rig explosion . \nObama plans to visit Gulfport , Miss. ; Theodore , Ala. ; and Pensacola , Fla. , on Monday and Tuesday . \nIn the Gulf : BP awaited the arrival of a second vessel to help pump more oil from the ruptured well up to the surface -- the containment cap was capturing 630,000 gallons a day , but the second vessel is expected to double that . \nMeanwhile , local business owners and workers who have filed damage claims were complaining that BP is slow to respond and not paying them enough for their losses . \nAt the White House : President Obama was scheduled to meet in the afternoon with the families of those killed on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . \nHe was also receiving a briefing on the oil spill in the morning and meeting with business leaders and energy experts to discuss energy reform after his meeting with the families . \nIn the Gulf : BP said it is dialing back a prediction by its chief operating officer that the leaking oil would be reduced to a `` relative trickle '' by next week . \nCOO Doug Suttles now says it will take more time to reach that point . \nAt the White House : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who is heading the U.S. oil spill response , said the containment operation is now catching up to 630,000 gallons -LRB- 2.3 million liters -RRB- a day and that the amount could nearly double by next week as processing of the captured oil is expanded . \nIn the Gulf : While the wellhead has been capped , oil that was still leaking and oil that has already leaked was separating and spreading out along the Gulf shore . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen warned the day before that the slick is no longer a `` large , monolithic spill . '' \nRather , it is an `` aggregation of hundreds or thousands of patches of oil that are going a lot of different directions . '' \nLocal officials continued to express concerns about the impact the spill would have on the economy as tourism season begins . \nAt the White House : President Obama was receiving a briefing on the spill in the morning before leaving to conduct a `` tele-town hall meeting '' on health care issues concerning seniors . \nHe and first lady Michelle Obama were holding a congressional picnic at the White House later in the day . \nIn the Gulf : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen reported that the cap on the wellhead was capturing 460,000 gallons of oil a day -- up from 250,000 on Friday . \nAt that rate , the cap could be diverting as little as 37 percent or as much as 77 percent of the oil leaking from the Gulf floor . \nPatches of oil were spreading out all along the Gulf region . \nFlorida 's Panama City Beach was expected to get hit by oil within 72 hours , while Pensacola Beach continued to have tar balls wash ashore . \nAt the White House : President Obama and top federal officials were briefed in Washington by Allen on the BP spill . \nThe president said the Gulf region will `` bounce back '' from the crisis and be `` stronger than ever . '' \nObama was scheduled to participate in a high school graduation ceremony in Kalamazoo , Mich. , later in the evening . \nIn the Gulf : BP CEO Tony Hayward said the container collected 10,500 barrels in 24 hours . \nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said the spill is killing tourism though the beaches in his state are not suffering badly from the oil . \nNational Incident Commander Adm. Thad Allen told morning news shows that progress is being made but the relief well is the ultimate solution . \nAt the White House : More Coast Guard are being sent to the region for direct oversight of the contractors . \nAllen said he reports to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President Obama but he is the on-scene coordinator and he makes the calls in the gulf . \nIn the Gulf : BP worked on its latest attempt to tame the runaway well by capping it and trying to siphon off some of the crude . \nThe damaged rig has disgorged at least 22 million gallons of crude in the Gulf . \nAt the White House : In his weekly radio and Internet address recorded from the Gulf , President Obama promised to fight the oil spill and maintained his increasingly forceful tone toward BP . \nIn the Gulf : BP engineers adjusted a sophisticated cap over the Gulf oil gusher , trying to collect the crude now fouling four states . \nEngineers hoped to close several open vents on the cap throughout the day in the latest attempt to contain the oil . \nAt the White House : President Obama was in Louisiana , his second trip in a week and the third since the disaster unfolded . \nIn the Gulf : BP CEO Tony Hayward hailed the company 's work after underwater robots successfully sheared off a busted oil pipe spewing millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf , telling reporters that the company would have a `` fully sealed '' containment system in place by the end of June . \nAt the White House : The White House announced President Obama will return to the Louisiana Gulf Coast Friday , his third trop to the region since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20 . \nIn the Gulf : BP 's effort to contain the oil gusher hit a snag when a saw became stuck in a thick pipe on a blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said the goal was to free the saw and finish the cut later in the day . \nAt the White House : The Justice Department has announced it started criminal and civil probes into the spill , although the department did not name specific targets for prosecution . \nIn the Gulf : BP is moving to start its first major pipe cut as soon as Wednesday , after which they will attempt to place a cap-like containment device over the leaking riser that would siphon the mixture to the surface . \nAt the White House : President Obama gave the leaders of an independent commission investigating the Gulf oil spill marching orders to thoroughly examine the disaster and its causes to ensure that the nation never faces such a catastrophe again . \nHe said if any laws were broken , people will be prosecuted . \nIn the Gulf : Transocean , which owned the rig that it leased to BP , said it would like its liability limited . \nThe beach at Grand Isle , La. , which was hit with oil from the spill , and other areas along the coast were opened but swimming and fishing was prohibited . \nAt the White House : The White House confirmed that its national incident commander Thad Allen will begin on Tuesday to hold daily press briefings from the scene of the spill . \nThe Justice Department announced Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. attorneys will meet with state attorneys general and hold a press conference on Tuesday . \nIn the Gulf : BP says it will try another containment effort beginning on Monday or Tuesday . \nAt the White House : Obama remained in Chicago for the Memorial Day weekend vacation . \nThe White House released a summary of a discussion between Obama and chief liaison Thad Allen , which said the government is tripling its environmental cleanup team in areas affected by the spill . \nEnvironmental adviser Carol Browner appeared on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' \nShe said 150 government scientists are on the case . \nIn the Gulf : BP offered few details on its latest bid to plug the well as progress was difficult to measure from BP 's `` spillcam '' of mud , gas and oil billowing from the seafloor . \nAt the White House : Obama returns to Chicago for his Memorial Day weekend vacation . \nIn the Gulf : BP continues to try the `` top kill '' method , but also tries shooting rubber and other man-made `` junk '' into the well . \nAt the White House : Obama tours the Louisiana coastline . \nHe says the federal government is treating the spill as its highest priority -- he says the government has deployed 1,400 National Guard troops , 1,400 vessels and 3 million feet of boom In the Gulf : BP continues to shoot heavy mud into the well , a process that appears to be making progress . \nAt the White House : Several developments related to the spill emerge in Washington . \nMinerals Management Service director Elizabeth Birnbaum resigns . \nThe Obama administration announces new restrictions on offshore oil drilling , canceling and delaying certain projects . \nObama holds a major press conference in which he declares the federal government is `` in charge '' and pledges to stop the leak . \nObama leaves for a family vacation in Chicago at night . \nIn the Gulf : BP attempts to use the `` top kill '' method to shoot mud into the well . \nMeanwhile , BP says 25,000 claims for economic losses have been submitted , and that it has already paid close to $ 30 million . \nAt the White House : Obama visits a solar facility in Fremont , Calif. . \nIn the Gulf : BP agrees to show a live feed of the `` top kill '' procedure under pressure from the Obama administration . \nAt the White House : Obama meets Italian President Giorgio Napolitano , then travels to San Francisco for fundraisers for Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . \n, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . \nIn the Gulf : BP continues to prepare for the `` top kill '' procedure , as oil moves deeper into the Louisiana marshes . \nAt the White House : Obama meets with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano lead a Senate delegation to the Gulf region . \nIn the Gulf : BP says it will take at least another two days before crews can start to implement the `` top kill '' plan to plug the leaking well . \nBP continues to siphon out some oil from the leak . \nAt the White House : Obama orders top administration officials back to the Gulf to monitor the response . \nIn the Gulf : BP says it intends to continue using chemical dispersants after the EPA raises concerns about their long-term effects . \nOil continues to wash ashore . \nAt the White House : Obama announces a presidential commission to investigate the disaster . \nHe says in his weekly radio address that the panel , which is given six months to complete its work , is intended to figure out the `` root causes '' of the explosion and figure out how to make offshore drilling safer . \nThe president speaks at the West Point commencement ceremonies in the morning . \nIn the Gulf : BP continues to prepare for the `` top kill '' procedure , while officials find animals covered in oil . \nAt the White House : No public events . \nIn the Gulf : BP continues to siphon out oil from the busted well . \nThe company begins preparing for a new plan to stop the oil leak called a `` top kill . '' \nThe plan involves injecting mud into the top of the well and then sealing the area with cement . \nAt the White House : No public events . \nIn the Gulf : U.S. officials reportedly hold talks with Cuban officials on response efforts amid concerns that the oil slick is spreading even farther . \nAt the White House : Obama welcomes Mexican President Felipe Calderon to Washington . \nBoth heads of state publicly criticize Arizona 's new immigration law . \nThe president hosts a state dinner for Calderon at night . \nIn the Gulf : A U.S. official says it is `` increasingly likely '' the oil will be swept out to the Florida coastline . \nAt the White House : Obama visits a factory in Youngstown , Ohio . \nIn the Gulf : BP claims the tube is sucking out more than 42,000 gallons a day from the Gulf floor to a tanker ship . \nThat 's still a fraction of the oil leaking out from the well . \nAt the White House : Obama hosts the NCAA tournament champion University of Connecticut women 's basketball team . \nIn the Gulf : BP crews successfully hook the tube to the oil pipe to siphon oil to a tanker ship . \nResearchers say the oil has entered a current that could carry it toward the Keys . \nAt the White House : No publicn events . \nIn the Gulf : BP struggles to install the tube into the oil pipe , but expresses optimism in the plan . \nThe company continues to drill a relief well , which is considered the permanent , though time-consuming , solution to the problem . \nThe process is about halfway done . \nAt the White House : Obama speaks at the National Peace Officers Memorial Service . \nHe delivers his weekly radio address on `` Wall Street Reform . '' \nIn the Gulf : BP uses robots to try to insert a small tube into the leaking pipe on the Gulf floor , in an attempt to seal it off and siphon oil to the surface . \nAt the White House : Obama honors TOP COPS award recipients at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : BP prepares to suck oil away from the spewing well before trying to place the smaller containment box on top . \nAt the White House : Obama flies to Buffalo , N.Y. , for a tour and town hall meetings at a local factory . \nHe later travels to New York City for a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee event . \nIn the Gulf : Crews lower the new , smaller containment box to the Gulf of Mexico floor . \nAt the White House : Obama meets with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the White House , then takes questions from the press . \nIn the Gulf : Response crews replenish fuel and water in preparation for long-term relief efforts . \nAt the White House : Reports surface that the Obama administration has proposed splitting up the Minerals Management Service , the agency responsible for overseeing offshore drilling . \nOne arm would be tasked with inspecting rigs and enforcing regulations while the other would oversee drilling leases . \nIn the Gulf : BP announces it will try to place a smaller dome over the leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAt the White House : Obama meets with Cabinet officials and senior staff at the White House to discuss the oil spill response . \nIn the Gulf : BP officials say , after the 100-ton box fails to stop the leak , that they may try to do the same thing with a smaller box . \nApproximately 3.5 million gallons of oil have spilled into the Gulf at this point . \nAt the White House : Obama speaks to graduates at Hampton University in Virginia . \nIn the Gulf : Balls of tar begin washing up on Alabama 's beaches . \nMeanwhile , the 100-ton box meant to capture the leak is not working . \nAt the White House : Obama delivers his weekly radio address on holding insurance companies more accountable . \nIn the Gulf : Robots place a 100-ton box over the oil well on the ocean floor , in an unprecedented attempt to stop the flow . \nOfficials expand the coastal area closed to fishing due to the spill . \nAt the White House : No public events . \nIn the Gulf : Officials confirm that oil has made landfall on the Louisiana coastline . \nBP prepares to lower a giant box over the oil well to capture the leak . \nAt the White House : Obama participates in a national security meeting on Afghanistan and Afghanistan . \nIn the Gulf : BP caps one of the three oil leaks , though thousands of barrels of oil continue to leak into the Gulf . \nAt the White House : Obama attends a Cinco de Mayo celebration at the White House . \nIn the Gulf : Winds in the Gulf of Mexico calm down , giving crews a chance to lay down boom by the shorelines . \nBP tries to cap a small leak while preparing to place a containment dome over the main leak . \nAt the White House : Obama speaks at the Business Council in Washington . \nThere he pledges to minimize economic damage from the oil spill . \nIn the Gulf : BP 's executive says crews are reducing the amount of oil reaching the surface by using dispersants . \nHe pledges that BP will pay `` all necessary and appropriate '' costs associated with the clean-up . \nAt the White House : The administration , holding a meeting with BP executives , presses BP to explain how it will cover those clean-up costs . \nThe president has a conference call with Allen and local officials to discuss the response . \nIn the Gulf : More vessels and response teams are deployed . \nFishing is shut down from the Mississippi River to the Florida panhandle . \nAt the White House : Obama travels to the Gulf coast to survey the damage and meet with local officials . \nHe calls the spill a `` potentially unprecedented '' disaster and pledges a `` relentless '' federal response . \nObama is later briefed on the attempted Times Square bombing . \nIn the Gulf : Two more offshore platforms are shut down in the Gulf of Mexico as a precaution . \nCrews continue using dispersants by the leak . \nThe slick from the explosion has tripled in size . \nCoast Guard Commandant Adm.

{"id": "918", "time": "2010-07-11", "text": "WASHINGTON -- It 's all so familiar . \nA technological disaster , then a presidential commission examining what went wrong . \nAnd ultimately a discovery that while technology marches on , concern for safety lags . \nTechnology is n't as foolproof as it seemed . \nAn offshore oil rig explodes , creating the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe common thread -- which the new presidential oil spill commission will be looking for -- often is technological arrogance and hubris . \nIt 's the belief by those in charge that they 're the experts , that they know what they 're doing is safe . \nAdd to that the human weaknesses of avoidance , greed and sloppiness , say academics who study disasters . \nEven before the oil spill commission holds its first meeting Monday in New Orleans , panel co-chairman William Reilly could n't help but point out something he 's already noticed . \nThe technology to clean up after an oil spill `` is primitive , '' Reilly said . \n`` It 's wholly disproportionate to the tremendous technological advances that have allowed deepwater drilling to go forward . \nIt just has n't kept pace . '' \nThen he added that government regulation also has n't kept pace . \nAnd something else has n't kept up either , Reilly said : how the oil industry assesses and works with the risk of catastrophic damage from spills . \nCutting-edge technology often works flawlessly . \nAt first , everyone worries about risk . \nThen people get lulled into complacency by success and they forget that they are operating on the edge , say experts who study disasters . \nCorners get cut , problems ignored . \nTechnological disasters , like the BP oil spill , follow a well-worn `` trail of tears , '' said Bob Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor who has studied 630 disasters of all types . \nBea is also an expert on offshore drilling and is consulting with the presidential commission . \nBea categorizes disasters into four groups . \nOne such group is when an organization simply ignores warning signs through overconfidence and incompetence . \nHe thinks the BP spill falls into that category . \nBea pointed to congressional testimony that BP ignored problems with a dead battery , leaky cement job and loose hydraulic fittings . \nIt 's that type of root cause -- not the equipment failure alone -- that the oil spill commission will focus on , including looking at the corporate and regulatory `` culture '' that led to bad decisions , Reilly said . \nDisasters do n't happen because of `` an evil empire , '' Bea said . \n`` It 's hubris , arrogance and indolence . '' \nAnd disasters will keep on happening . \nIn the future , watch out for problems with the U.S. power grid , Sacramento levee failures , flood protection problems along coastal cities and even some of the newest high-tech airplanes , said Rutgers University professor Lee Clarke , author of the book `` Worst Cases . '' \n`` There 's nothing safe out there , '' said Yale University professor Charles Perrow , author of the book `` Normal Accidents . '' '' \nWe like to pretend there is and argue afterward , ` That 's why we took the risks because it had n't failed before . ' '' \nTechnological improvements have gradually led to more daring offshore drilling attempts . \n`` It kind of creeps up on you , '' Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in an interview with The Associated Press . \nThen suddenly you realize that now only robots can do what people used to do because the drilling is so deep , he said . \nClarke put it this way : `` We 've been doing this every day , every year , week in , week out , so next week when we go to 5,000 feet , it will be like last week when we went to 300 feet , '' Clarke said . \n`` It 's just the arrogant presumption that you have got the thing under control , whatever the thing is . \nIn this case , it 's drilling beyond your depth . '' \nPaul Fischbeck , a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University , said the existence of a blowout preventer -- a final backup system which in this case did n't work -- often encourages people to take extra risks . \nBut the oil industry was so confident in its safety that it used to brag when compared to another high-tech gold standard : NASA . \n`` They looked more successful than NASA , '' said Rice University oil industry scholar Amy Myers Jaffe . \n`` They had less mechanical failures . '' \nThe oil rig explosion `` reminds me an awful lot of the NASA accidents , '' said Stanford physics professor Douglas Osheroff , who was on the commission that examined the causes of the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 . \n`` Obviously none of these systems are fail-safe , '' Osheroff said . \n`` People do n't spend enough time thinking about what could go wrong . '' \nAnd because people are so sure of themselves , when they see something go wrong that they ca n't fix , they accept it , Osheroff said . \nThe Columbia accident investigation board called it `` normalization of deviance . '' \nPieces of foam insulation had broken off the shuttle external fuel tank six previous times before that problem proved fatal with Columbia when a piece of foam knocked a deadly hole in a shuttle wing . \nHot gas had singed `` O '' rings in space shuttle boosters well before the problem led Challenger to explode at launch in 1986 . \nYale 's Perrow pointed to NASA 's shuttles and another BP disaster -- the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 people -- as cases of simply ignoring `` heavy warnings '' from experts . \nWhen the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board looked into the 2005 refinery fire it noted that BP had the same problems with `` safety culture '' that NASA had before Columbia . \n`` The Texas City disaster was caused by organizational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP Corporation , '' the board 's final report said . \n`` Warning signs of a possible disaster were present for several years , but company officials did not intervene effectively to prevent it . '' \nThere have been times when warnings of disaster are heeded . \nThe Y2K computer bug is noteworthy for prevention , Clarke said . \nMany people scoffed and criticized the government for making such a big deal of something that turned out to be a fizzle . \nBut that 's because of all the effort to prevent the disaster , Clarke said . \nUnfortunately , safety costs money , so it 's usually not a priority , Clarke said . \nMost of the time `` you ca n't get anybody to listen , '' he said . \n`` We 're very reactive about disasters in the United States . '' \nPeople do n't think about them until afterward , he said , and then they say : `` You should have seen that coming . '' \n"}
{"id": "2168", "time": "2010-07-11", "text": "A summary of events Sunday , July 11 , Day 82 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that began with the April 20 explosion and fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP PLC , which is in charge of cleanup and containment . \nThe blast killed 11 workers . \nSince then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well . \nOil spewed largely unchecked once again into the Gulf of Mexico as BP crews worked to replace a leaky cap with a new containment system they hope will finally catch all the crude from the busted well . \nRobotic submarines removed the cap Saturday that had been placed on top of the leak in early June . \nBP says it 's possible the new , tighter cap would be in place Monday , but it could take more time . \nOn Sunday , officials said the work was going according to plan . \nBP hopes the capping operation will be done within three to six days . \nThere 's no guarantee that such a delicate operation nearly a mile below the water 's surface will go according to plan . \n`` It 's not just going to be , you put the cap on , it 's done . \nIt 's not like putting a cap on a tube of toothpaste , '' Coast Guard spokesman Capt. James McPherson said . \nAnd the hurricane season that lasts through November could interfere . \nThere are no storms forecast now , but if one blows through , the ships collecting the oil may have to leave and crude would spew again for days into the water . \nIf the new cap withstands the pressure of the oil , the Gulf region could get its most significant piece of good news since the explosion . \nBut it would be only a temporary solution . \nHope for permanently plugging the leak lies with two relief wells , the first of which should be finished by mid-August . \nObama adviser David Axelrod says the administration is confident that BP 's latest effort to contain the gushing oil will work . \nHe acknowledged BP 's engineers are in `` uncharted waters '' when it comes to dealing with the leak . \nAxelrod appeared on `` Fox News Sunday '' and ABC 's `` This Week .

{"id": "2102", "time": "2010-07-29", "text": "WASHINGTON -- In 1969 , Sen. Gaylord Nelson was so moved after seeing the devastation of an oil spill off the California coast near Santa Barbara that he called for a national teach-in on the environment . \nThe following year the resulting '' Earth Day '' kick-started the modern environmental movement and shaped the way Americans thought about their air , water and soil . \nForty years later , the magnitude of the Gulf oil spill far exceeds Santa Barbara 's spill of up to 100,000 barrels , but there has n't been a comparable societal transformation . \nLast week , legislation imploded in the Senate to reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming , derailing environmentalists ' top goal , and no national consensus has emerged to move America off oil and other fossil fuels into clean energy . \nEven a new more modest Senate bill , aimed at boosting energy efficiency and preventing oil spills , faces an uncertain future . \nNelson , a Wisconsin Democrat who had long championed the environment , laid out the idea of a teach-in during a speech in Seattle . \nHe wrote the speech on napkins while flying there , recalls his daughter , Tia Nelson . \nThe senator 's call inspired the first Earth Day , with millions participating across the country , including 2,000 college campuses and 10,000 elementary and high schools . \nCongress adjourned so lawmakers could give speeches . \nIn 1970 , President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act into law . \nWorries about air pollution , the dangers of DDT and polluted rivers from industrial wastes played a part . \nBut the Santa Barbara spill was the catalyst . \nIt `` triggered a social movement and helped to create a new politics , the politics of ecology , '' mystery novelist Ross Macdonald once wrote . \nIn contrast , President Barack Obama last month used an Oval Office speech to push for clean energy , but Republicans accused him of trying exploit the Gulf tragedy for political gain . \nThe president took it from both sides , as some liberal commentators faulted him for failing to specifically back a cap on carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming . \nThe Gulf spill is estimated between 94 million and 184 million gallons , far worse than Santa Barbara 's total . \nBut the 10-day spill from a well blowout six miles offshore covered miles of California 's sandy beaches with a thick , oily sludge . \nPictures of dead seals , dolphins and thousands of birds captured the nation 's attention . \n`` Santa Barbara 's psychological effect was huge , and it really got into the American mind in ways that clean air and clean water and other things had a hard time doing because they were n't personified , '' says Oliver A. Houck , who teaches environmental law at Tulane University in New Orleans . \n`` So why has n't BP yet had the same transformative effect ? \nWhen Santa Barbara came along it was a big deal . \nWhen BP comes along , there are so many big deals that it has a hard time competing for attention . \nThat said , I think it 's got an enormous national play . '' \nThe Santa Barbara spill featured its own version of Tony Hayward , the former chief executive of BP who angered people early on with comments such as `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean , '' playing down the potential environmental impact . \nIn February 1969 , Fred Hartley , the Canadian-born head of Union Oil Co. , which owned the Santa Barbara well , told a Senate hearing in Washington : `` I am always tremendously impressed at the publicity that the death of birds receives vs. the loss of people in our country in this day and age . '' \nNoting there had been no loss of human lives from the Santa Barbara well blowout , Hartley added , `` Relative to the number of deaths that have occurred in this fair city due to crime ... it does seem that we should give this thing a little perspective . '' \nHartley rejected calls to halt offshore drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel , citing arguments similar to those employed by opponents of the Obama administration 's moratorium . \nHartley said he told Ronald Reagan , California 's governor then , that it would be like `` making a decision to shut down the whole university educational system because there is a riot in San Francisco . '' \nLois Capps , now a Democratic congresswoman representing Santa Barbara , was a young stay-at-home mother in 1969 who would often take her two children to the beaches there . \n`` It shaped my views along with everyone in the region , '' she says . \n`` It was such a devastating event . \nThe spill was much closer to the shore , so we felt its impact sooner and more directly than this long , drawn-out affair we 're having in the Gulf . '' \nCapps says there has been a strong reaction in Congress to the BP Gulf spill , with dozens of hearings and several pieces of legislation making their way through the House and Senate . \nBut it 's too early to draw conclusions about a societal shift , she says . \n`` It does n't happen overnight , '' Capps says . \n`` I think these things build like a tidal wave . '' \nGaylord Nelson 's speech calling for a teach-in came eight months after the January 1969 spill , and the resulting Earth Day did n't take place until more than a year later -- April 1970 . \nAnd it was not until 1981 that Congress imposed a ban on offshore drilling along most of the nation 's coastal waters , an action widely attributed to the memories of the Santa Barbara spill a dozen years earlier . \nThe moratorium endured for a quarter century , until Congress lifted it in 2008 . \n`` I think we 're going to see a really significant response to what happened in the Gulf played out over time , '' says Sarah Chasis , ocean initiative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council . \n`` I think it 's going to affect people 's consciousness , thinking , the way they approach issues for a long time . '' \nThere are signs this is starting to happen . \nAn Associated Press poll last month found that 72 percent of Americans rated the environment as extremely important or very important -- up from 64 percent in May and 59 percent in April . \nActor Ted Danson , a board member for the international ocean conservation group Oceana , says the focus has until now been stopping the leak . \n`` I am hopeful . \nI think the time will come , '' Danson says . \n`` Oil is a very , very powerful lobby . \nAnd the basic feeling out in the world , and I think mostly created by people whose interests are in oil , is that alternative energy is a very sweet , kind , loving thought , but certainly its day has not come . \nWe need oil . '' \nJames `` Bud '' Bottoms , a Santa Barbara resident who co-founded `` Get Oil Out '' in 1969 , says the Gulf spill reminded him of those days . \n`` The same thing happened here , '' says Bottoms , now 82 . \n`` We stood there on our banks and saw our harbors and beaches black , about two or three inches of thick goo . \nWe stood here and cried along our beach . \nWe thought our lives were over here in Santa Barbara . '' \nBottoms penned a children 's book in 1969 called `` Davey and the GOM , '' which was n't published until 2008 . \n`` GOM '' stands for `` Giant Oil Monster . '' \nIt 's also the acronym the offshore drilling industry and government regulators use for something else : The Gulf of Mexico . \n"}
{"id": "1806", "time": "2010-07-20", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- Oil from BP 's blown out well is seeping into the Gulf of Mexico but more slowly this time , and the U.S. government appears confident the cap that stopped the flow last week is n't creating a more dangerous situation . \nThe government said Monday that oil was seeping into the Gulf after days of warning that the experimental cap on the oil well could cause more leaks . \nBut it declared the development insignificant and forged ahead with BP 's plan for finally sealing the hole in the ocean floor . \nEngineers have been checking -- using underwater cameras and monitoring pressure and seismic readings -- to see whether the well would hold or spring a new leak , perhaps one that could rupture the sea floor and make the disaster even worse . \nSmall amounts of oil and gas started coming from the cap late Sunday , but `` we do not believe it is consequential at this time , '' retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . \nAlso , seepage from the sea floor was detected over the weekend less than two miles away , but Allen said it probably has nothing to do with the well . \nOil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . \nAt briefing in Washington , Allen said BP could keep the cap closed at least another 24 hours as long as the company remained on alert for leaks . \nSince the cap was put in place Thursday , beachgoers have reported less oil fouling the shore . \nBob Broadway , 41 , of Huntsville , Ala. , said his vacation spot in Orange Beach , Ala. , has improved from a month ago . \nThen , he said , the oil was thick `` like chocolate '' and the beach smelled like `` an old mechanic 's garage . '' \n`` The beach looks better now than before , '' he said Monday . \nBP and the government had been at odds over the company 's desire to simply leave the cap in place and employ it like a giant cork until a relief well being drilled deep underground can be used to plug the well permanently . \nAllen initially said his preference was to pipe oil through the cap to tankers on the surface to reduce the slight chance that the buildup of pressure inside the well would cause a new blowout . \nThat plan would require releasing millions more gallons of oil into the ocean for a few days during the transition -- a spectacle BP wants to avoid . \nOn Monday , Allen said unless larger problems develop , he 's not inclined to open the cap . \nAlso on the table : Pumping drilling mud through the top of the cap and into the wellbore to stop up the oil flow . \nThe idea is similar to the failed top kill plan that could n't overcome the pressure of the geyser pushing up . \nBP said it could work now because there 's less oil to fight against , but it was n't clear how such a method would affect the cap 's stability . \nAllen said the relief well was still the plan for a permanent fix . \nBP and the government are still trying to understand why pressure readings from the well are lower than expected . \nAllen offered two possible explanations : The reservoir the oil is gushing from is dwindling , or there is an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . \nWork on a permanent plug is moving steadily , with crews drilling into the side of the ruptured well from deep underground . \nBy next week , they could start blasting in mud and cement to block off the well for good . \nKilling the well deep underground works more reliably than bottling it up with a cap . \nSomewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have gushed into the Gulf over the past three months in one of America 's worst environmental crises . \nBP PLC said the cost of dealing with the spill has now reached nearly $ 4 billion . \nThe company said it has paid $ 207 million to settle claims for damages . \nAlmost 116,000 claims have been submitted and more than 67,500 payments have been made . \nJuly 17 , 2010 : The containment stack is shown at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \n"}
{"id": "59", "time": "2010-07-20", "text": "June 26 : President Obama and British Prime Minister Cameron talk at the conclusion of the G20 conference in Ontario , Canada . \nAFP In an effort to defuse what will likely be the biggest point of contention in their Tuesday White House meeting , British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to tell President Obama that the release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was `` wrong . '' \nIn their first White House meeting , the two leaders are also expected to discuss Afghanistan , BP 's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf and its alleged role in the release of al-Megrahi . \nIn an interview with BBC news , Cameron , who was elected prime minister in May , said he `` deeply regrets '' the pain the decision caused , but asserted that the release of al-Megrahi in August of last year was the decision of the Scottish government alone . \n`` All I know is , as leader of the opposition , I could not have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong , '' be told the BBC . \nAl-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the December 1988 bombing that killed 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie , Scotland . \nAl-Megrahi , who suffered from prostate cancer , was released in August 2009 by Scottish officials on `` compassionate grounds '' after he was given only 3 three-months to live . \nAl-Megrahi received a hero 's welcome when he returned to his native Libya -- where he is still living -- almost one year later . \nJust as British-owned BP sealed the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , the company came under fire again , but this time for allegations that BP , which has lucrative oil contracts in Libya , lobbied the British government in 2007 to proceed with a UK-Libya prisoner transfer agreement . \nBP has acknowledged it warned the Labor government of a possible `` negative impact on UK commercial interests , '' but denies there were any discussions with either the UK or Scottish government about al-Megrahi . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Saturday there was no evidence BP had any connection with al-Megrahi 's release , but there is little doubt Prime Minister Cameron , who travels to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leadership Tuesday , will be peppered with BP questions . \nJust last week New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called on the company to suspend oil drilling plans in Libya until the company 's role in the release of al-Megrahi is investigated . \n`` The bottom line is simple : If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it just might be a corrupt deal between BP , the British government and Libya , '' said Schumer , who lost numerous constituents in the December 21 , 1988 , bombing , `` Back in 2007 , BP and the Libyan government struck a $ 900 million oil deal that the prime minister , Tony Blair , helped coordinate , '' said Schumer in a news conference with reporters . \n`` But the deal ran into roadblocks , and BP admits that it pushed the British government to expedite a prisoner exchange agreement with Libya to smooth the way for an oil deal . \nWe then know that the British government agreed to release al - Megrahi based on a fraudulent doctor 's prognosis that he only had three months to live . \nAll of a sudden , once Megrahi is released , all the roadblocks to that oil deal are removed and , lo and behold , the oil deal is finally approved . \nIf anyone thinks this is a coincidence , I have them a bridge to sell them in Brooklyn , '' the senior senator from New York charged . \nIn his interview with BBC , Cameron said on the topic , `` I have no idea what BP did . \nI am not responsible for BP . '' \nBut BP and the oil spill the in the gulf have strained relations between the U.S. and U.K. since the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion on April 20th . \nAnd as British prime minister , Cameron has had to lead the defense of the British-owned company amid harsh criticism from the American government and its citizens affected by the spill . \nJune was an especially tough month for relations . \nAs tens of thousands of barrels of oil continued to spill into the Gulf , President Obama , who early on in the environmental disaster referred to the company as `` British Petroleum , '' said he would have fired BP CEO Tony Hayward . \nThe president also embraced the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend and criticized BP for spending money on a PR campaign . \nThe angry words from Washington produced a backlash in the U.K. , where millions of British retirees depend on BP , the world 's third-largest oil company , for their pensions . \nAnd Cameron had promised to press Obama during their one-on-one first meeting during the G8\\/G20 in Toronto , for a dollar amount so BP would have an idea of the final costs related to the oil spill . \nNo such request was made , at least publicly . \nRelations between the two countries seem to have simmered since Hayward was pulled from handling the oil spill 's day-to-day operations and President Obama sat down with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg . \nThe administration 's meeting with BP executives in June led to the company 's announcement of a $ 20 billion escrow fund over 4 years , to pay claims to Gulf Coast residents and business owners affected by the spill . \nFollowing the four hour meeting with senior administration officials , the chairman also announced the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders and the creation of a $ 100 million fund to assist out of work oil workers following the government 's six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nTuesday 's Oval Office meeting will be the second time the two world leaders are meeting , and the first time in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said of all topics to be discussed , Afghanistan topped the U.S. 's list of priorities . \nThere are now approximately 10,000 British troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO led effort and the British have seen an increase in causalities as of late . \nThe U.K. hopes to have withdrawn all its forces by 2015 . \nAsked if Obama would try to dissuade Cameron from naming a target date , Gibbs said , `` it is hard to look that far into the future . \nObviously , the president has committed to July of 2011 as a date of our transition and begin to , based on -- judging that based on the conditions on the ground to begin removing some of the troops that -- that the president added as a part of our increased resources there over the past couple years . '' \nFollowing their Oval Office sit down , Obama and Cameron will participate in an East Room joint press conference . \nThe events speak to the often described `` special relationship '' between the U.S. and U.K. , but its a welcome Prime Minister Cameron 's predecessor did not receive . \nPresident Obama welcomed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to the White House just six weeks after being sworn in himself , but the meeting between the president and the prime minister of one of the U.S. 's biggest allies was lackluster . \nMany Brits considered it a snub that Brown was only received for an Oval Office sit down meeting -- no joint press conference in the East Room or Rose Garden as his predecessor Tony Blair frequently participated in during his tenure with former President George W. Bush . \nOf course , Blair 's relationship with Bush was questioned back at home with many charging Bush treated Blair as a `` lap dog . '' \nAccording to Heather Conley of Center for Strategic and International Studies , a think tank in Washington , in forging his relationship with this U.S. president , Cameron needs to strike a balance between the perceived `` subordinate , ` poodle ' relationship '' he had with Bush , and Gordon Brown 's `` dour , technocratic approach . '' \n`` It remains to be seen if the two leaders will develop that ` special ' chemistry that has been historically evident between American and British leaders but appears to be somewhat elusive between President Obama and other world leaders , '' said Conley . \nConley added that Cameron should be given credit , after only two months on the job , for making some `` gutsy political calls '' like publicly apologizing for British actions related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland ; announcing a significant reduction in government spending as well as increasing taxes to reduce the U.K. 's budget deficit ; announcing that British forces will leave Afghanistan no later than 2015 ; and last , but certainly not least , politically navigating the fallout over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAs part of his schedule while in the states , according to the British embassy , the prime minister will have breakfast with Vice President Joe Biden , travel to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leaderships , as well as have a sit down with Arizona Republican Senator John McCain . \nAlso on Tuesday , Cameron will have his first sit-down interview with a U.S. television outlet since becoming prime minister -- with ABC 's Diane Sawyer . \nOn Wednesday , the Prime Minister will travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before proceeding to the Pentagon for military briefings on Afghanistan . \nHe will then travel to New York for meetings with U.S. business leaders , and with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon . \nHe also will have dinner with the Mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg . \n"}
{"id": "1322", "time": "2010-07-18", "text": "July 17 , 2010 : The containment stack is shown at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nNEW ORLEANS -- BP and the Obama administration offered significantly differing views Sunday on whether the capped Gulf of Mexico oil well will have to be reopened , a contradiction that may be an effort by the oil giant to avoid blame if crude starts spewing again . \nPilloried for nearly three months as it tried repeatedly to stop the leak , BP PLC capped the nearly mile -LRB- kilometer -RRB- - deep well Thursday and wants to keep it that way . \nThe government 's plan , however , is to eventually pipe oil to the surface , which would ease pressure on the fragile well but would require up to three more days of oil spilling into the Gulf . \n`` No one associated with this whole activity ... wants to see any more oil flow into the Gulf of Mexico , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said Sunday . \n`` Right now we do n't have a target to return the well to flow . '' \nAn administration official familiar with the spill oversight , however , told The Associated Press that a seep and possible methane were found near the busted oil well . \nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity Sunday because an announcement about the next steps had not been made yet . \nThe concern all along -- since pressure readings on the cap were n't as high as expected -- was a leak elsewhere in the wellbore , meaning the cap may have to be reopened to prevent the environmental disaster from becoming even worse and harder to fix . \nThe official , who would not clarify what is seeping near the well , also said BP is not complying with the government 's demand for more monitoring . \nWhen asked about the official 's comments , BP spokesman Mark Salt would only say that `` we continue to work very closely with all government scientists on this . '' \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's spill response chief , insisted Sunday that `` nothing has changed '' since Saturday , when he said oil would eventually be piped to surface ships . \nThe government is overseeing BP 's work to stop the leak , which ultimately is to be plugged using a relief well . \nAllen decided to extend testing of the cap that had been scheduled to end Sunday , the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said . \nThat means the oil will stay in the well for now as scientists continue run tests and monitor pressure readings . \nThe official did n't say how long that would take . \nOfficials at the Department of Homeland Security referred questions to a statement issued by Allen ; neither he nor BP officials could explain the apparent contradiction in plans . \nSuttles ' comments carved out an important piece of turf for BP : If Allen sticks with the containment plan and oil again pours forth into the Gulf , even briefly , it will be the government 's doing , not BP 's . \nThe company very much wants to avoid a repeat of the live underwater video that showed millions of gallons of oil spewing from the blown well for weeks . \n`` I can see why they 're pushing for keeping the cap on and shut in until the relief well is in place , '' said Daniel Keeney , president of a Dallas-based public relations firm . \nThe government wants to eliminate any chance of making matters worse , while BP is loath to lose the momentum it gained the moment it finally halted the leak , Keeney said . \n`` They want to project being on the same team , but they have different end results that benefit each , '' he said . \nOil would have to be released under Allen 's plan , which would ease concerns that the capped reservoir might force its way out through another route . \nThose concerns stem from pressure readings in the cap that have been lower than expected . \nScientists still are n't sure whether the pressure readings mean a leak elsewhere in the well bore , possibly deep down in bedrock , which could make the seabed unstable . \nOil would be have to be released into the water to relieve pressure and allow crews to hook up the ships , BP and Allen have said . \nSo far , there have been no signs of a leak . \n`` We 're not seeing any problems at this point with the shut-in , '' Suttles said at a Sunday morning briefing . \nAllen said later Sunday that scientists and engineers would continue to evaluate and monitor the cap through acoustic , sonar and seismic readings . \nThey 're looking to determine whether low pressure readings mean that more oil than expected poured into the Gulf of Mexico since the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 people and touching off one of America 's worst environment crises . \n`` While we are pleased that no oil is currently being released into the Gulf of Mexico and want to take all appropriate action to keep it that way , it is important that all decisions are driven by the science , '' Allen said in a news release . \n`` Ultimately , we must ensure no irreversible damage is done which could cause uncontrolled leakage from numerous points on the sea floor . '' \nBoth Allen and BP have said they do n't know how long the trial run will continue . \nIt was set to end Sunday afternoon , but the deadline -- an extension from the original Saturday cutoff -- came and went with no word on what 's next . \nAfter little activity Sunday , robots near the well cap came to life around the time of the cutoff . \nIt was n't clear what they were doing , but bubbles started swirling around as their robotic arms poked at the mechanical cap . \nTo plug the busted well , BP is drilling two relief wells , one of them as a backup . \nThe company said work on the first one was far enough along that officials expect to reach the broken well 's casing , or pipes , deep underground by late this month . \nThe subsequent job of jamming the well with mud and cement could take days or a few weeks . \nIt will take months , or possibly years for the Gulf to recover , though cleanup efforts continued and improvements in the water could be seen in the days since the oil stopped flowing . \nSomewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons -LRB- 356 million and 697 million liters -RRB- have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nThe spill has prevented many commercial fishermen from their jobs , though some are at work with the cleanup . \nSome boat captains were surprised and angry to learn that the money they make from cleanup work will be deducted from the funds they would otherwise receive from a $ 20 billion compensation fund set up by BP . \nThe fund 's administrator , Kenneth Feinberg , told The Associated Press on Sunday that if BP pays fishermen wages to help skim oil and perform other cleanup work , those wages will be subtracted from the amount they get from the fund . \nLongtime charter boat captain Mike Salley said he did n't realize BP planned to deduct those earnings , and he doubted many other captains knew , either . \n`` I 'll keep running my boat , '' he said Sunday on a dock in Orange Beach , Alabama , before heading back into the Gulf to resupply other boats with boom to corral the oil . \n`` What else can I do ?

'' \nSo far , at least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the nation 's worst-ever offshore oil spill . \nVirtually every lawsuit names as defendants BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. , well contractor Halliburton Co. and Cameron International , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer . \nThe plaintiffs make up the entire mosaic of the Gulf Coast : shrimpers and oystermen , charter boat captains , beach resort and condo owners , restaurants and bars , seafood suppliers , bait and tackle shops , even tourist attractions like Key West 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum . \nMost of the parties claim severe economic losses from the oil spill , ranging from the fish they can no longer catch to tourists who never arrived to rent rooms . \nThere are also a few wrongful death and injury lawsuits filed , mainly in state courts , by workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion and relatives of some of the 11 men who died . \nAnd some BP investors also have sued , claiming the company 's mistakes led to a sharp drop in its stock price . \nA federal judicial panel is meeting Thursday in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of the lawsuits for pretrial decisions before a single judge , a development that most observers say is a foregone conclusion . \nBP and the other companies favor federal court in Houston -- near their major U.S. operations -- while a majority of plaintiffs ' attorneys have suggested New Orleans , closer to the broken well and to many of the hardest-hit victims . \nCourts in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama also are being suggested as venues . \nIt 's difficult to estimate potential damages that BP could be forced to pay , or what shape a settlement might take . \nBut legal experts say BP alone is looking at some $ 2 billion in costs just to defend itself , with the $ 20 billion fund set aside to pay oil spill claims and cleanup costs potentially not enough to foot the entire bill . \n`` There 's no way it 's going to be enough , '' said Victor Diaz , a Miami attorney experienced in similar large-scale cases such as those involving faulty Chinese drywall . \n`` We still do n't know what will happen later , what the second and third wave of damages might be . \nWhat happens if six months later , some fish species is wiped out ? '' \nOne example of post-spill lawsuits : the owners of a Louisiana shrimp boat claim in a new lawsuit they are suffering health problems including headaches , nausea and shortness of breath after working for BP in the collecting and burning of oil in the Gulf . \nBP 's liability is already larger than the Exxon Valdez case , which ultimately led to a $ 500 million payout to affected fishermen and residents . \nOther large `` mass tort '' cases include drug maker Merck & Co. 's agreement in 2008 to a $ 4.85 billion settlement of some 50,000 cases stemming from its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx . \nAlso , Pharmaceutical company Wyeth initially settled claims over its diet drug fen-phen for $ 3.75 billion in 1999 , but that soared to more than $ 21 billion by 2004 as more claims were filed . \nAsbestos , which has caused widespread lung disease and other ailments , is the longest-running mass lawsuit case in U.S. history , costing a variety of companies more than $ 70 billion and involving more than 730,000 claims since the 1970s , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Rand Corp. . \nAnd tobacco companies have been slapped with thousands of lawsuits over the dangers of cigarette smoking . \nThey won most of them until the major companies agreed in 1998 to a 25-year , $ 206 billion settlement with 46 states who sued over the costs to their health programs . \nThe BP case will differ in many ways from those involving drug companies , automakers and asbestos manufacturers , where people died or suffered illnesses directly caused by the product . \nIn an oil spill , oystermen whose beds were choked off by oil might have relatively easy claims to prove , but what about a beachfront hotelier whose business fell off , or a property owner whose house may suddenly be worth much less ? \n`` People who have those indirect claims are going to have a difficult time under any situation , '' Hollabaugh said . \n`` Where does it end ? \nYou could say the oil spill has harmed our whole country . '' \nMany of the lawsuits are proposed class actions , in which a plaintiff such as a commercial fisherman or a property owner seeks to represent everyone else in the same situation . \nOne task for the judge appointed to preside over the consolidated cases is sorting out which of those overlap , and which should be deemed class actions . \nOne wild card is the claims process created by BP and President Barack Obama 's administration . \nThat process , administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , promises oil spill victims quicker access to money for what BP calls `` legitimate '' claims than the traditional legal process . \nFeinberg is touting the plan as a generous alternative to a lawsuit , telling one audience in Washington that although legal action remains an option , `` You 're crazy to do so . '' \nFeinberg made similar arguments in convincing most survivors and victims ' families to join the federal 9\\/11 compensation fund rather than sue airlines or other companies individually over the terror attacks . \nSome plaintiffs ' attorneys have raised questions about how the claims process can guarantee a fair result . \nBut Howard Erichson , a law professor at Fordham University , said people also are taking their chances with the court system . \n`` Litigation is expensive , it 's time-consuming , it is unpredictable , '' Erichson said . \n`` The results often vary in unpredictable ways . \nPlaintiffs in mass tort litigation end up losing a lot of the money to legal fees and expenses . \nIf the compensation fund is fair , I 'm all for it . '' \nAnother unknown is whether BP and the other Deepwater Horizon companies will work together to defend themselves or sue each other . \nMuch depends on the outcome of a Justice Department criminal investigation that could point the finger more heavily at one or the other ; Transocean is already asking a federal judge in Houston to limit its liability to $ 27 million under a century-old law meant to cut losses for shipping companies when vessels like the floating Deepwater Horizon rig are sunk . \nSomewhat forgotten in all the economic litigation are the rig victims and their families . \nMichelle Jones , the wife of lost rig worker Gordon Jones , wants to keep her lawsuit separate so it does not get lost in the shuffle . \n`` While the damages incurred by the fishermen and property owners is significant , the stakes in Jones ' case involves everyday living expenses and the education costs for her two children , '' Michelle Jones ' attorney wrote in a federal court filing . \n`` After losing her husband , and her sons losing their father , she may have to wait years .

'' \nThe Coast Guard initially reported that an oil sheen a mile long and 100 feet wide had begun to spread , but hours later said crews were unable to find any spill . \nCoast Guard Petty Officer Steve Lehmann in New Orleans said Friday morning that an 87-foot Coast Guard cutter patrolling the area has not reported any signs of leaks . \nA helicopter was to survey the site later in the day . \nHouston-based Mariner did not know what caused the fire . \nThe 13 workers who were pulled from the water told rescuers that there was a blast on board , but Mariner 's Patrick Cassidy said he considered what happened a fire , not an explosion . \nPlatforms are vastly different from oil rigs like BP 's Deepwater Horizon . \nThey are usually brought in after wells are already drilled and sealed and the oil is flowing at a predictable pressure . \nA majority of platforms in the Gulf do not require crews on board . \n`` A production platform is much more stable , '' said Andy Radford , an API expert on offshore oil drilling . \nMany platforms , especially those in shallower water , stand on legs that are drilled into the sea floor . \nLike a giant octopus , each spreads numerous pipelines and can tap into many wells at once . \nThe Deepwater Horizon was drilling a well a mile beneath the sea , which made trying to plug it after it blew out an incredible challenge , with BP trying techniques never tested . \nThe platform that caught fire , meanwhile , was operating in 340 feet of water in a shallow area of the Gulf known as a major source of gas . \nResponding to any oil spill in such a shallow spot would be much easier than in deep water , where crews depend on remote-operated vehicles to access equipment on the sea floor . \nPlatforms do not have blowout preventers like deep water rigs that are supposed to shut down wells if there is problem . \nBut they are usually equipped with a series of redundant valves that can shut off oil and gas at different points along the pipeline . \nMariner Energy officials said there were seven active production wells on its platform , and they were shut down shortly before the fire broke out . \nThe platform was still intact and a small portion appeared burned , Cassidy said . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the company told him the fire began in 100 barrels of light oil condensate . \nPhotos showed at least five ships floating near the platform . \nThree were shooting great plumes of water onto the machinery , an image similar to when the Deepwater Horizon exploded . \nCrews decided to let that blaze burn itself out , and the rig sank into the Gulf two days after the blast . \nOn the Mariner Energy platform , the fire was out less than 12 hours . \nA Homeland Security update obtained by The Associated Press said the platform was producing 58,800 gallons of oil and 900,000 cubic feet of gas per day . \nThe platform can store 4,200 gallons of oil . \nThe workers aboard the platform were found huddled together , holding hands and wearing life jackets . \nA captain of the Crystal Clear , a 110-foot boat that rescued them , said his craft was 25 miles away when it received a distress call . \nWhen Capt. Dan Shaw arrived at the scene , the workers had been in the water for two hours and were thirsty and tired . \n`` We gave them soda and water , anything they wanted to drink , '' Shaw said . \n`` They were just glad to be on board with us . '' \nShaw said workers told him the blast was so sudden that they did not have time to get into lifeboats . \nThey did not mention what might have caused it . \n`` They just said there was an explosion , there was a fire , '' Shaw said . \n`` It happened very quick .

'' \nBut others say that the latest fire is no cause for concern -- and may even support arguments against the ban . \nCharlotte Randolph , president of the Lafourche , La. , Parish and an outspoken critic of the moratorium , said the outcome of Thursday 's platform fire proved that the oil and gas industry has effective safety procedures . \n`` The people were safely recovered . \nThe oil did not spill . \nIt 's everything the Deepwater Horizon was not , '' she said . \nThe current drilling ban , which does n't apply to oil platforms like the one affected by Thursday 's fire , has halted drilling at 33 ocean wells , but there still are more than 7,300 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico , 58 percent of them in deep waters , according to the American Petroleum Institute . \nThere are about 3,400 platforms operating in the Gulf , pumping about a third of America 's domestic oil . \nPlatforms are vastly different from oil rigs like BP 's Deepwater Horizon . \nThey are usually brought in after wells are already drilled and sealed and the oil is flowing at a predictable pressure . \nA majority of platforms in the Gulf do not require crews on board . \nThe initial reports of Thursday 's platform fire triggered a collective panic , but unlike the April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig -- which killed 11 people and led to the largest offshore oil spill in the nation 's history -- this fire killed no one and sent no crude gushing into the water . \nThe latest fire `` is another reminder that drilling accidents happen all too frequently . \nWe can not afford to lose any more human lives , nor can we tolerate further damage to the Gulf and its irreplaceable ocean ecosystems , '' said Jacqueline Savitz of the environmental group Oceana . \nRep.

{"id": "282", "time": "2010-11-08", "text": "April 21 : This file photo shows BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig burning after an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , off the southeast tip of Louisiana . \nScientists recently discovered certain elements from the remains of the spill moved exceptionally quickly through the area 's ecosystem . \nAP WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have for the first time tracked how certain nontoxic elements of oil from the BP spill quickly became dinner for plankton , entering the food web in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe new study sheds light on two key questions about the aftermath of the 172 million-gallon spill in April : What happened to the oil that once covered the water 's surface and will it work its way into the diets of Gulf marine life ? \n`` Everybody is making a huge deal of where did the oil go , '' said chief study author William `` Monty '' Graham , a plankton expert at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama . \n`` It just became food . '' \nThe study did n't specifically track the toxic components of the oil that has people worried . \nIt focused on the way the basic element carbon moved through the beginnings of the all-important food web . \nGraham said the `` eye-opening '' speed of how the oil components moved through the ecosystem may affect the overall health of the Gulf . \nMichael Crosby of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida did n't take part in the study but said what fascinated him was that the carbon zipped through the food web faster than scientists expected . \nThat in itself is n't alarming , but if the nontoxic part of the oil is moving so rapidly through the food web , Crosby asks : `` What has happened to the toxic compounds of the released oil ? '' \nGraham said it was too hard to study the toxins in tiny plankton , which are plant and animal life , usually microscopic . \nSo he had to go with an indicator that 's easier to track : the ratio of different types of carbon in microbes and plankton around and even under the BP oil slick . \nThat important ratio jumped 20 percent , showing oil in the food web . \nBy late September the carbon ratios in microscopic life had returned to normal , Graham said . \nGraham emphasized that the results of his research do n't mean the plankton , the fish that feed on it or the people who eat Gulf seafood are at any risk . \nWhat he found , he said , is merely a biomarker that shows the movement of spill-related carbon through the food chain . \nMuch of the plankton he studied was `` swimming around and doing great '' and in equal or higher numbers than before the spill , he said . \nGraham 's study , released Monday , is published in Environmental Research Letters . \nIt was mostly funded by the National Science Foundation , with additional money from the state of Alabama and BP 's Gulf Research Initiative , which distributed money through the Northern Gulf Institute in Mississippi . \nFor Graham it 's noteworthy how voracious the oil-munching bacteria were : `` The microbes came to the rescue . '' \nAfter they snacked on the surface oil , other microscopic sea life ate the microbes and were , in turn , chomped on by zooplankton , tiny animals . \nLarry McKinney , director of a Gulf research institute at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi , said the study confirms what scientists had expected . \nThe big question is will it affect eggs and larvae and next year 's production of shrimp , crabs and fish , McKinney said . \n"}
{"id": "2167", "time": "2010-05-09", "text": "May 6 : The oil containment box is lowered into the Gulf at the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig collapse . \nAP As a massive oil leak spit thousands of gallons more crude into the Gulf of Mexico , a big box that BP hoped would be its savior sat idle hundreds of feet away , encased in ice crystals . \nThe company 's first attempt to divert the oil was foiled , its mission now in serious doubt . \nMeanwhile , thick blobs of tar washed up on Alabama 's white sand beaches , yet another sign the spill was worsening . \nIt had taken about two weeks to build the box and three days to cart it 50 miles out and slowly lower it to the well a mile below the surface , but the frozen depths were just too much . \nBP officials were not giving up hopes that a containment box -- either the one brought there or another one being built -- could cover the well . \nBut they said it could be days before another attempt to capture the oil and funnel it to a tanker at the surface would be tried . \n`` I would n't say it 's failed yet , '' BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said . \n`` What I would say is what we attempted to do ... did n't work . '' \nThere was a renewed sense of urgency as dime - to golfball-sized balls of tar began washing up on Dauphin Island , three miles off the Alabama mainland at the mouth of Mobile Bay and much farther east than the thin , rainbow sheens that have arrived sporadically in the Louisiana marshes . \n`` It almost looks like bark , but when you pick it up it definitely has a liquid consistency and it 's definitely oil , '' said Kimberly Creel , 41 , who was hanging out and swimming with hundreds of other beachgoers . '' \n... I can only imagine what might be coming this way that might be larger . '' \nAbout a half dozen tar balls had been collected by Saturday afternoon at Dauphin Island , Coast Guard chief warrant officer Adam Wine said in Mobile , and crews in protective clothing patrolled the beach for debris . \nAuthorities planned to test the substance but strongly suspected it came from the oil spill . \nIn the nearly three weeks since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers , about 210,000 gallons of crude a day has been flowing into the Gulf . \nUntil Saturday none of the thick sludge -- those iconic images of past spills -- had reached shore . \nIt had taken more than 12 hours to slowly lower to the seafloor the peaked box the size of a four-story house , a task that required painstaking precision to accurately position it over the well for fear of damaging the leaking pipe and making the problem worse . \nNothing like it had been attempted at such depths , where water pressure can crush a submarine . \nCompany and Coast Guard officials had cautioned that icelike hydrates , a slushy mixture of gas and water , would be one of the biggest challenges to the containment box plan , and their warnings proved accurate . \nThe crystals clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box , BP 's Suttles said , like sand in a funnel , only upside-down . \nOptions under consideration included raising the box high enough that warmer water would prevent the slush from forming , or using heated water or methanol . \nEven as officials pondered their next move , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said she must continue to manage expectations of what the containment box can do . \n`` This dome is no silver bullet to stop the leak , '' she said . \nThe captain of the supply boat that carried the hulking , concrete-and-steel vault for 11 hours from the Louisiana coast last week was n't giving up hope . \n`` Everybody knew this was a possibility well before we brought the dome out , '' Capt. Demi Shaffer , of Seward , Alaska , told an Associated Press reporter stationed with the 12-man crew of the Joe Griffin in the heart of the containment zone . \n`` It 's an everyday occurrence when you 're drilling , with the pipeline trying to freeze up .

Bobby Jindal said Saturday . \nThe project would cost $ 200 million and take four to six months to complete its first phase , adding 43 miles to extend the Chandeleur island chain off the state 's eastern coastline in both directions , said Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser , speaking at a press conference with Jindal . \nHowever , even a few days of dredging would improve coastal protections , he added . \nBP will be asked to fund the project , Jindal said . \n`` It would be so much easier to clean oil off this -LRB- dredged -RRB- sand than to deal with in our marshes , '' Jindal said . \nState and parish officials are seeking expedited permitting from the Environmental Protection Agency , and will also need approval from the U.S. Coast Guard , Nungesser said . \nA BP well 50 miles off Louisiana 's coast has leaked oil into the Gulf of Mexico for more than two weeks , ever since a rig working the site caught fire and sank . \nThe slick has reached the Chandeleur Islands , and a heavy patch of oil is four or five miles off the entrance to Southwest Pass , the commercial shipping route into the Mississippi River , Nungesser said . \nOn Saturday , BP said a containment device it had lowered onto the larger of two leaks had run into a hitch , after the opening at the top clogged with crystallized gas and water . \nThe company plans to take two days to remove the hydrates and determine next steps . \nOne option includes injecting methanol , a chemical used as antifreeze , to prevent hydrates from forming , said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer . \nContainment dome technology has never been used at such depths before . \nJindal said the dredging plan is one way Louisiana can `` prepare for the worst-case scenario '' in case the well continues to leak for another three months until BP can drill a relief well cutting off the flow of oil . \nPlaquemines Parish had drafted plans as far back as 2008 to expand its barrier islands to protect the coast against storm surges , but was unable to secure federal funding needed to begin the project , a parish spokesman said . \nNungesser said Saturday that the dredging the parish hopes BP will fund can also serve as storm protection once the threat from the oil slick passes . \n"}

'' \nIn Britain , newspapers and politicians on Friday slammed the Obama administration 's treatment of the company . \nThe timing of the match fed the fire . \nThe Times of London ran a cartoon that showed soccer player Obama `` booting '' a ball with a BP logo on it . \nHis uniform showed the president was sponsored by `` Mid Term Elections Inc. '' Facing public pressure , Obama has taken a tougher tone toward BP in recent days . \nHe said earlier in the week that he 'd fired BP CEO Tony Hayward and claimed that he was scouting for an `` ass to kick . '' \nU.S. senators called on BP to stop dividend payments , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed that call on Friday . \nTimes Editor James Harding told Fox News it sends a troubling signal when the president is in `` ass-kicking mode . '' \n`` It does n't help anyone when you start getting personal , '' he said . \nOfficials insist things are n't that bad . \nMartin Longden , a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington , said there 's a `` huge amount of understanding for where the administration is here '' and that the match is unrelated . \n`` I do n't think the two do play into each other in any meaningful way , '' he said . \nDoes that mean there 's no sense of rivalry ? \nThe Embassy is opening up its doors to staff members , families and a few `` football aficionados '' to watch the game Saturday -- the American staff members are invited , but only so they can be shamed . \n`` They want them to be there to witness England 's triumph , '' Longden said . \nNile Gardiner , director of The Heritage Foundation 's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom , said the BP issue has developed into a `` major confrontation '' between London and Washington . \nBut he said the rage is mostly political and that the relationship between the American and British people will remain strong . \n`` You are going to see that in the aftermath of tomorrow 's World Cup match , no matter what the result , '' he said . \nGardiner , who came to the United States from Britain eight years ago , will be rooting for England . \n"}
{"id": "847", "time": "2010-06-11", "text": "GRAND ISLE , La. -- GRAND ISLE , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The astonishing news that the oil leak at the bottom of the sea may be twice as big as previously thought could have major repercussions for both the environment and BP 's financial health , killing more marine life and dramatically increasing the amount the company must pay in fines and damages . \nScientists now say the blown-out well could have been spewing as much as 2 million gallons of crude a day before a cut-and-cap maneuver started capturing some of the flow , meaning more than 100 million gallons may have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico since the start of the disaster in April . \nThat is more than nine times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , previously the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe larger estimates , while still preliminary and considered a worst-case scenario , could contribute to breathtaking liabilities against BP . \nPenalties can be levied against the company under a variety of environmental protection laws , including fines of up to $ 1,100 under the Clean Water Act for each barrel of oil spilled . \nBased on the maximum amount of oil possibly spilled to date , that would translate to a potential civil fine for simple discharge alone of $ 2.8 billion . \nIf BP were found to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct , the civil fine could be up to $ 4,300 per barrel , or up to $ 11.1 billion . \n`` It 's going to blow the record books up , '' said Eric Schaeffer , who led the Environmental Protection Agency 's enforcement office from 1997 to 2002 . \nA larger spill also could lead to increased environmental hazards , with shrimp , crabs and fish such as marlin and swordfish especially hard hit . \n`` Certainly if there are greater volumes of oil than were originally estimated , that does n't bode well , '' said Jim Franks , a fisheries biologist at the University of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast Research Laboratory . \n`` Do we expect twice the impact ? \nI do n't know how to judge that , but that much more oil could not be good at all for fish and wildlife resources . \nI would anticipate far-reaching impacts . '' \nDays after the spill began , government officials told the public that the ruptured well a mile below the Gulf was leaking 42,000 gallons a day . \nThen , officials said it was actually five times bigger . \nThat estimate did n't last long either . \nThe new estimates are based on spillcam video as well as such things as satellite , sonar and pressure readings . \nThe lead scientist in the effort said the most credible range at the moment is between 840,000 gallons and 1.68 million gallons a day . \nAnother part of the equation is how much more oil started to leak last week after the riser pipe was cut , a step that BP and government officials said could increase the flow by 20 percent . \nThe pipe cut was necessary to install a cap over the well ; the cap has captured an estimated 4 million gallons so far . \nIf the higher-end estimates prove accurate , the leak amounts to an Exxon Valdez every five days or so . \nAt that rate , in just over three weeks from now it will eclipse the worst oil spill in peacetime history , the 1979 Ixtoc disaster in Mexico , which took 10 months to belch out 140 million gallons of oil into the Gulf . \nAnd there 's more bad news . \nThe oil gushing from the Gulf contains large amounts of natural gas . \nSamantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia , said that can contribute significantly to oxygen levels plummeting in the water as microbes eat the methane clouds . \nIn addition to the potential for billions in fines , BP is responsible for paying all cleanup costs and up to $ 75 million for economic damages . \nBut it could face far heavier expenses if gross negligence is found or if it is determined that there was a violation of a federal safety , construction or operating regulation , Schaeffer said . \n`` You bet the trial lawyers are sharpening their swords around that language , '' he said . \nAnd that 's not including the tens of billions of dollars in shareholder wealth that has already evaporated with the plunge of BP 's stock since the disaster . \nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg became a lonely defender of BP , declaring the world should not rush to point fingers at the British oil giant . \nThe billionaire tycoon often sides with CEOs and businesses entangled in public relations disasters . \n`` The guy that runs BP did n't exactly go down there and blow up the well , '' Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show . \n`` And what 's more , if we want them to fix it and they 're the only ones with the expertise , I think I might wait to assign blame . '' \nThat the BP oil spill may be twice as bad as earlier estimates was hard news to hear but no surprise to Christian Delos Reyes , a 39-year-old oyster dredger . \n`` Crabs start real small . \nYou know they 're all going to die . \nIt 'll kill all the oysters . \nIn my opinion , I do n't think it 'll ever be all right , '' Reyes said . \n`` I think it 's destroyed .

{"id": "1663", "time": "2010-06-29", "text": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Minerals Management Service -- well , the name anyway -- now sits on the scrap heap of discarded monikers alongside ValuJet , Blackwater and Enron Field . \nNot that a new name makes it any easier for the Obama administration to convince a skeptical Congress that the agency will be any better at policing offshore drilling . \nThe new name , the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- or BOE for short -- is designed to emphasize regulatory and enforcement responsibilities of the troubled agency , which is part of the Interior Department . \nThe change comes in the wake of the disastrous BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nMMS had been panned for its lax oversight of offshore drilling . \nA recent report by the department 's inspector general said that its drilling regulators have been so close to the industry that they 've accepted gifts from oil and gas companies and even negotiated to go work for the companies . \nMichael R. Bromwich , the new head of the MMS -- er , BOE -- assured Congress that the change is much more than cosmetic . \n`` I think it 's substantive , '' Bromwich said . \n`` Regulation and enforcement have been added to the title of the agency because those elements , I think , by consensus have been lacking in the approach of the agency . '' \nOne marketing expert told The Associated Press that the Obama administration has made a mistake by changing the name at a time when the agency is still the focus of negative attention . \nThe danger , said Kelly O'Keefe , managing director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Brandcenter , is that the new name gets tarnished with the old baggage . \n`` If you 're trying to dodge a negative situation , it is a very bad idea to do that in the middle of that negative situation , '' O'Keefe said . \n`` Because what happens is the bad news is n't over -- it certainly is n't for MMS or BP . '' \n`` It 's really hard to pull a fake-out , to say , ` Hey , we 're something different now , ' '' O'Keefe added . \n`` We tend to see through that . '' \nOr , as `` The Daily Show '' host Jon Stewart deadpanned last week , `` Are we really that stupid ? '' \n`` This is n't just a name change or branding exercise , '' said Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff . \nThe new name , she said , reflects Interior Secretary Ken Salazar 's mission for the agency as it undergoes reorganization . \nSalazar plans to break up the agency into three separate entities to eliminate conflicts of interest . \nGovernment agencies have been changing their names since the beginning of the republic . \nIn 1789 , just a few months into its existence , the Department of Foreign Affairs became the State Department . \nAccording to the State Department website , that switch was made because the agency took over several new domestic responsibilities , such as custody of the Great Seal of the United States . \nFor most of its existence , the Army was known as the Department of War . \nIn 1947 , it was converted to the Department of the Army and grouped with the Navy and newly created Air Force under a new National Military Establishment , headed by the new secretary of defense . \nCongress changed the National Military Establishment into the Department of Defense two years later , with significantly more authority for the defense secretary . \nIn its 1947 report on the legislation unifying the military services , the Senate Committee on Armed Services said it had been guided by `` the basic objectives of our government -LRB- 1 -RRB- to maintain the peace and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to remove the causes of war . \nIn support of those objectives it is essential that there be established a structure fully capable of safeguarding our national security promptly and effectively . '' \nHarvey Sapolsky , retired director of security studies and professor emeritus of public policy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said ridding the term `` war '' back then was not about making the department sound less bellicose . \n`` We might see differences in ` war ' and ` defense , ' but I do n't think they did , '' he said . \nInstead , the change was motivated by efficiency , coordination and creating an Air Force . \nThree decades after the Department of War was no more , the government excised `` welfare '' from another department 's name . \nIn 1980 , the new Department of Education was born , while the old Health , Education and Welfare Department became the Health and Human Services Department . \n`` Welfare '' was nowhere to be found in the title of either department -- 16 years before President Bill Clinton signed legislation to fulfill a campaign promise to `` end welfare as we know it . '' \nSometimes the rebranding can mean adding a key word . \nLast week , President Barack Obama signed an executive order renaming the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . \nThe new name , the President 's Council on Fitness , Sports and Nutrition , was made to emphasize healthy eating habits , dovetailing with first lady Michelle Obama 's campaign against childhood obesity . \nThe council has a jazzed-up website , with photos , videos and the words `` You 're it . \nThat was n't even its first name change . \nWhen President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the council in 1956 , he called it the President 's Council on Youth Fitness . \nWhen it comes to MMS , Stewart questioned the need for a new name . \n`` Why do n't we just rename the water in the Gulf ` H20 Black ' ?

Thad Allen , the federal government 's point man for the spill response , said the storm was n't expected to affect two relief wells being drilled , considered the best hope of plugging the leak . \nEven 12-foot waves are n't enough to stop the tanker that is sucking up large quantities of oil through the cap on the well , or a second vessel that is burning off hundreds of thousands of gallons at the surface , Allen said . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also said Monday that the weather could push the oil farther into the ecologically delicate Barataria Bay , home to a diverse group of wildlife . \nOther officials echoed that worry . \nRough seas already have forced barges to leave their posts as a barrier against the oil near the bay . \n`` We 've already lost over 68 days of decent weather and this is going to be an active hurricane season , '' Jefferson Parish Council Chairman John Young said Monday . \n`` They 're going to start coming yet there continues to be a lack of a sense of urgency . '' \nFor now , Alex is on track to stay well away from the spill before making landfall with hurricane-force winds near the U.S.-Mexico border , possibly by Thursday . \n`` We are watching very , very closely , '' said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \n`` As it stands right now , absent the intervention of a hurricane , we 're still looking at mid-August '' for completing the relief well . \nEarlier Monday , a BP executive said the well would be done by early August . \nAll of the uncertainty of what Alex and other storms could do to BP 's containment effort gave new urgency to the company 's efforts to make its operations at the well as hurricane-resistant as possible . \nThe company said it hopes to install a new oil-capturing system by next week that would allow BP to disconnect the equipment faster if a hurricane threatens and hook it back up quickly after the storm passes . \nRight now , BP would need five days to pull out if there is a hurricane . \nThe new system being developed , which uses a flexible hose , would cut that to two days . \nThe containment system now in place is capturing nearly 1 million gallons per day from the well , which is spewing as much as 2.5 million gallons a day , according to the government 's worst-case estimate . \nIn other developments , BP said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the catastrophe has cost it $ 2.65 billion so far . \nThe oil giant has also said it would set up a $ 20 billion fund to compensate people and businesses for their losses . \nBP has lost more than $ 100 billion in market value since the deep-water drilling platform it was operating blew up April 20 , killing 11 workers . \n"}

\nSARAH PALIN , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : I did . \nI kind of have a big beef with you too though , Bill , if you do n't acknowledge that President Obama is wrong on his call for a need for energy policy . \nCertainly we need that , but he is wrong not to acknowledge that we still need on a three-legged stool the conventional sources of energy to be drilled here . \nOtherwise , Bill , we are going to be dropped to our knees and bowing to the Saudis and Venezuela and places like Russia that will keep producing oil and petroleum products , and we will have to ask them to produce for us because we will still be dependent upon these sources of energy . \nIn addition though , too , shifting more towards the renewables which , of course , we need . \nAnd the other leg of that stool is conservation . \nPresident Obama , it scares me , it saddens me that the CEO of our nation does not understand that inherent link between the conventional sources of energy that we 're dependent upon and our security , our prosperity , our freedom . \nO'REILLY : OK , what was the -- when you were the governor of the state , you dealt with oil companies all the time . \nWhat was the most difficult thing that you had to deal with when you were having meetings with them face to face ? \nPALIN : Believing that their perception of what the circumstances were in any situation that we dealt with them , whether it be a spill or lax infrastructure maintenance or the value of the resource that was being sold . \nIn any of those issues , it was believing what they were telling me and my administration in terms of their perspective on what the facts were . \nNow , here 's where the problem lies with President Obama in waiting so long , you know , eight weeks before meeting with the CEO of BP and with the high-ranking officials that have been calling the shots . \nHe has allowed this industry player to get to define the facts . \nSo they are just in this position of having astronomical maximum liability exposure . \nHe 's allowed them to define the facts of this spill . \nYou can never be allowed to do that as a CEO and be on a level playing field , being equals there at the table when you allow one side of the table , in this case BP , in dealing with this spill to define the facts . \nO'REILLY : All right . \nBut 49 percent , according to a poll today , we 'll have later , 49 percent of Americans still want BP to run the show . \nAnd only 45 percent want the government to run the show . \nSo most Americans are n't down with the Obama administration calling the shots . \nNow , President Obama basically is , as Charles Krauthammer pointed out , a dreamer . \nI mean , he wants , I think , good for the nation as far as energy is concerned . \nYou made a very valid point . \nWe ca n't throw the oil people under the bus . \nIf we do that , our economy is going to tank totally . \nAnd if we spend billions of dollars on pie in the sky stuff that does n't work , we 're going to go bankrupt . \nSo what is your solution here , governor ? \nWhat would you do tonight ? \nTell the nation tonight what you would have said your main point in that speech . \nPALIN : Stopping the gusher . \nThat 's the No. 1 priority of the nation . \nO'REILLY : But nobody knows how to do it . \nPALIN : We need to make sure that all technology is being thrown at this problem . \nO'REILLY : Nobody knows how to do it . \nPALIN : Well , we have n't had the assurance that president -- we have n't had the assurance by the president that that has been his top priority . \nInstead , what his top priority is , Bill , is cap and tax . \nIt is using this crisis , not letting it go to waste , but to use this crisis to increase the cost of energy . \nO'REILLY : All right , if that happens , there will be an outcry . \nPALIN : And that is going to stall any kind of economic recovery that we have . \nO'REILLY : Are you telling me that you do n't think the president 's top priority is stopping that leak ? \nIs that what you are telling me ? \nPALIN : What I 'm telling you is that is not what I am hearing and what the American public is hearing from the top official in our government . \nAnd that 's why those poll numbers show that , no , the public , we do n't know where to turn . \nIf we ca n't trust BP to be able to fix this leak , we know we ca n't trust government because they 've had eight weeks of overseeing , of regulating and kind of coaching this whole process , this whole issue of stopping the leak . \nAnd they have n't succeeded in doing it . \nPALIN : We have to know -- we have to know that President Obama 's No. 1 priority is to stop the leak . \nO'REILLY : But I 'm assuming that it is . \nAnd I am assuming that it is . \nBut , look , the reason I 'm pleased to have you on the program tonight is that there is not a governor in the United States who has more experience than you do dealing with the oil companies . \nYou 've already said you ca n't believe them , that their word does n't mean much when you are debating issues as far as the oil company 's interest and the interest of the people . \nYou ca n't believe them . \nNow , the oil company BP says we do n't know how to stop the leak . \nWe 're going to try X. We 're going to dig another well . \nWe 're going to do this . \nWe do n't know . \nWe do n't know . \nObama obviously does n't know how to stop the leak . \nDo you know how to stop it ? \nPALIN : Well , then what the federal government should have done was accept the assistance of foreign countries , of entrepreneurial Americans who have had solutions ... PALIN : They ca n't even get a phone call returned , Bill . \nThey are known in the Norwegian . \nThey are known for -- for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills . \nThey offered to help and , yet , no , they too , with a proverbial ca n't even get a phone call back . \nThat is what the Norwegians are telling us , and the Dutch are telling us . \nAnd then the entrepreneurial Americans , the company in Maine that has the boom and the absorbents , those companies that are waiting for the Obama administration eight weeks later for the regulators to come in and say , OK , we 'll purchase from you now . \nWe 'll do all that we can . \nThat 's where some of the frustration is . \nNow , we saw the same thing though with Katrina , did n't we ? \nSo , I 'm not going to point fingers and make this a partisan issue at all , point fingers at different administrations . \nBut it is that inherent problem that we have with government , not necessarily being prepared , because our priorities in government are wrong . \nNational security , safety of the people , needs to be the top priority . \nThat 's where we need to be funding instead of funding these other things on the periphery that really just get in the way of the private sector 's progress , their ability to produce and to thrive and to prosper , Instead , our priorities in the national government have been screwed up . \nNow , as governor of Alaska , what I did in dealing with the oil companies , and I 'll bet you , 75 percent of my time was being taken up by energy issues here in this state . \nI had to set up our Petroleum Systems Integrity Office so that we could be there on the front lines making sure what the oil companies were telling us was legit , when they were dealing with their corroded pipes that we found out and other lax maintenance issues . \nPALIN : It took us putting that as the highest priority to protect our resources , to protect our environment , including not just the physical environment but the human environment here . \nO'REILLY : All right . \nWell , that 's a good point . \nThere was n't anybody from the management service or whatever -- Mineral Management Service out on the pipeline checking it out . \nThat 's for sure . \nHey , Governor , always a pleasure . \nThanks for coming on . \nO'REILLY : Go ahead , real quick . \nWe ca n't -- we ca n't afford though to -- we ca n't afford to demonize these energy producers to such an extent though that they go under . \nWe do need to work with them though , but we need to verify everything it is and hold them accountable for all that they have done in this situation . \nO'REILLY : All right , governor . \nContent and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. . \nAll materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , displayed , published or broadcast without the prior written permission of Roll Call . \nYou may not alter or remove any trademark , copyright or other notice from copies of the content . \n"}

'' \nHe later said he was very sorry for speaking `` clumsily .

'' \nTo make matters worse , Ridge figures his house on the water in Myrtle Grove has lost half it 's value due to the oil spill . \n`` They can say he did n't mean it that way , but that 's how they think of us , '' Ridge said . \n`` They ca n't keep their foot out of their mouth , '' he added referring to Hayward 's comments . \nIn Alabama , Terry Hanners , who owns a small construction company in Gulf Shores , said the chairman 's remark revealed something about BP 's frame of mind . \n`` These BP people I 've met are good folks . \nI 've got a good rapport with them , '' said Hanners , 74 . \n`` But BP does not care about us . \nThey are so far above us . \nWe are the nickel-and-dime folks of this world .

'' \nThe president assured the public that the $ 20 billion amount does not represent a `` cap '' on damages that BP may be liable for , but noted that it was substantially larger than the $ 75 million amount the firm is liable for under federal law . \nObama said the account offers `` substantial assurance '' that claims will be honored . \n`` BP 's liabilities for this spill are significant and they acknowledge that fact , '' Obama said . \n`` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable . \nAnd I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . '' \nObama also said the company had agreed to set up a separate $ 100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers laid off as a result of his six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nThe deal with the White House arranges for the company responsible for the largest manmade environmental disaster in U.S. history to set aside the money in a fund to be administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg . \nFeinberg oversaw payments to families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and is currently President Obama 's `` pay czar , '' setting salary limits for companies getting the most aid from a $ 700 billion government bailout fund . \nThe announcement follows an Oval Office address to the nation Tuesday night in which the president said he was meeting with BP executives to inform them that they are to `` set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness . '' \nObama said the fund will not be controlled by BP but by an `` independent , third party . '' \nThe meeting with Svanberg , CEO Tony Hayward and other BP executives included several administration officials -- Homeland Secretary Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Energy Secretary Steven Chu , Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , Attorney General Holder , Vice President Joe Biden , Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett , It was Obama 's first meeting with BP officials since the spill . \nWhile Hayward has served as the voice of the company , the White House has been emphasizing the role of the company 's chairman , Svanberg , instead . \nThe BP decision to cancel dividend payments means investors will lose out on the $ 2.6 billion payment scheduled for June 21 and even more money over the rest of the year . \nFor the president , the tough diplomacy with a few officials behind closed doors is a bookend to his attempt to reach millions at once . \nUsing a delivery in which even the harshest words were uttered in subdued tones , Obama did not offer much in the way of new ideas or details in his speech to the nation Tuesday night . \nInstead , he mainly recapped the government 's efforts , insisted once again that BP will be held to account and tried to tap the resilience of a nation in promising that `` something better awaits . '' \nRepublicans criticized him for using the speech to push energy legislation but also chided him on Wednesday for taking 58 days to hold a high-level meeting with BP executives . \nThe Republican National Committee released a web video titled , `` What Took So Long ? '' \ndrawing attention to all the fundraisers , golf outings and meetings with the celebrities the president has participated in since the April 20 explosion . \nThe escrow account was something many lawmakers had called for . \nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and 53 other Democratic senators had requested BP set up a $ 20 billion account , but in a letter issued Monday said that does not limit the firm from future expenses . \nAfter the administration reached a deal with BP for the escrow account , a senior treasury official told Fox News that Feinberg would start administering the account immediately , though he would continue to oversee bailed-out banks . \nThe official said Feinberg would transition away from those duties over the summer . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "1774", "time": "2010-06-16", "text": "June 15 , 2010 : President Obama speaks from the Oval Office on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nPresident Obama is drawing bipartisan criticism for using the BP oil spill to revive an energy regulation bill that 's been on the back burner since last year , with lawmakers saying the so-called `` cap-and-trade '' package does nothing to stop the leak or mitigate the damage . \nObama , trying to take control of a crisis that has slowly eroded support for his administration , addressed the nation from the Oval Office Tuesday night to rally support for his efforts to tackle the spill . \nHe pointed to the relief efforts already underway and said the government would hold BP responsible . \nBut later in his 18-minute speech , he turned to focus on the need to `` seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels '' and tout Democrats ' climate legislation . \n`` We ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy , because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security and our environment are far greater , '' Obama said in the first Oval Office address of his presidency . \nWhile the president was taking the long view , lawmakers said that 's not the kind of response Gulf residents suffering immediate economic and environmental damage need . \n`` If my house is on fire , I do n't need the fire chief telling me I should not have built the house out of wood . \nI need somebody to put the fire out , '' Republican Alabama Gov. Bob Riley told Fox News on Wednesday . \n`` We have a crisis here . \n... Last night , we were going through again the same type of rhetorical persuasion that the president is very good at , but not now . '' \nSen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif . \n, was quoted by The San Francisco Chronicle saying , `` the climate bill is n't going to stop the oil leak . '' \nStopping the leak should come first , she said . \nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he agrees with Feinstein and that the energy policy proposed by Obama will not help Gulf residents in the near-term . \n`` What they 're doing here in effect is holding the Gulf hostage to a national energy tax , '' he told Fox News . \nThe speech came 57 days after the April 20 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and sparked the crisis , in which millions of gallons of oil already have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe speech also served as a prelude to Obama 's meeting Wednesday with BP executives at the White House . \nObama plans to press executives to set up an escrow account to pay economic damages to Gulf residents . \nIn his speech , Obama called on all Americans to contribute to `` a new future that will benefit all of us . '' \nHe used similar language to kick-start action on his health care overhaul last year . \n`` As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good , middle-class jobs , but only if we accelerate that transition , '' Obama said . \n`` Only if we seize the moment . \nAnd only if we rally together and act as one nation -- workers and entrepreneurs ; scientists and citizens ; the public and private sectors . '' \nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . \n, on Tuesday praised Obama 's comments on his energy agenda . \n`` I firmly believe that a diverse energy strategy will help our nation reduce pollution , create millions of clean energy jobs that can never be outsourced and lower our dependence on oil , '' Reid said in a written statement . \nHe said he looks forward to passing a bipartisan energy bill this year and urged Republicans to work with Democrats on the issue . \nThe climate bill most likely to pass the Senate is one sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , I-Conn . \n, and John Kerry , D-Mass . \nThey said on Tuesday that their bill will save energy and create jobs . \n`` It will create 440,000 additional jobs annually through 2020 and 540,000 additional jobs through 2030 , '' Kerry said . \nLieberman said one analysis shows the plan would save 2 million barrels of oil a day by 2030 -- in part by getting heavy trucks to run on natural gas . \nHe said that inaction at this point would lead to sustained dependence on oil and `` risk repetition of what 's happening in the Gulf today . '' \nBut Republicans were outraged that climate change legislation would be discussed in the same breath as the Gulf oil crisis . \n`` Instead of leveraging this crisis to manufacture knee-jerk political support for cap-and-trade energy taxes , President Obama should focus on providing the people of the Gulf with real and honest solutions to this horrible environmental disaster that this administration has been slow in waking up to , '' Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said in a written statement . \n"}

'' \nBP said it will suspend its dividend for the rest of this year and set up the $ 20 billion fund to assure victims of the Gulf oil spill that they will be compensated for their losses . \nThe British oil giant also will cut spending and sell some assets to deal with the cleanup and compensation costs , which have already hit $ 1.75 billion . \nBP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg announced the moves Wednesday after emerging from the White House , where he and other BP executives met for four hours with Obama . \nThe `` small people '' of the Gulf Coast have a humongous message for oil giant BP : They 're tired of the company 's big-time executives making insensitive comments . \nSvanberg told reporters in Washington : `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care , but that is not the case with BP . \nWe care about the small people . '' \nJustin Taffinder of New Orleans was not amused . \n`` We 're not small people . \nWe 're human beings . \nThey 're no greater than us . \nWe do n't bow down to them . \nWe do n't pray to them , '' Taffinder said . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward expects to tell Congress he is `` personally devastated '' by the Gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger Americans feel toward him and his company . \nThe explosion and sinking of the rig `` never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , '' he said in testimony to be delivered to a House panel Thursday . \n`` My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . '' \nA copy of Hayward 's testimony was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press . \nBP began burning oil siphoned from the ruptured well as part of its plans to more than triple the amount of crude it can stop from reaching the sea , the company said . \nBP PLC said oil and gas siphoned from the well first reached a semi-submersible drilling rig on the ocean surface around 1 a.m. . \nOnce that gas reaches the rig , it will be mixed with compressed air , shot down a specialized boom made by Schlumberger Ltd. and ignited at sea . \nIt 's the first time this particular burner has been deployed in the Gulf of Mexico . \nJournalists covering the oil spill have been yelled at , kicked off public beaches and islands and threatened with arrest in the nearly three weeks since the government promised improved media access . \nAdm. Thad Allen issued a May 31 directive to BP and federal officials ensuring media access to sites along the coast . \nBP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles followed up with a letter to news organizations , saying the company supports people 's rights to share their thoughts with reporters . \nBut those efforts have done little to curtail the obstacles , harassment and intimidation tactics journalists are facing while covering the spill . \nMarine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange -- and troubling -- phenomena . \nFish and other wildlife are fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast . \nBut that is not the hopeful sign it might appear to be , researchers say . \nThe animals ' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted , and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen . \nAlso , the animals could easily get devoured by predators . \nAfter 50 years of watching wetlands created by the fertile Mississippi River turn into open water , Louisiana residents finally got what they 'd long awaited : A U.S. president saying he 'll fight to save what little is left along their eroding coast . \nThough details were vague , President Barack Obama 's pledge to restore the Gulf Coast 's degraded coast line has multibillion-dollar implications for the region 's culture and economy and could preserve wildlife endangered by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nIn an Oval Office address Tuesday night , Obama said he was committed to making sure southern Louisiana , which is hemorrhaging a football field of marshland every 38 minutes , and other coastlines are saved . \n"}
{"id": "213", "time": "2010-05-31", "text": "BP PLC CEO Tony Hayward talks to reporters as he visits a Coast Guard command center in Venice , La. , Sunday , May 30 , 2010 . \nAP PORT FOURCHON , La. -- PORT FOURCHON , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The 40-foot-long corrugated steel boxes , resembling oversized white shipping containers , are stacked two high and three wide atop a barge at Port Fourchon , the oil industry 's hub on the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe words `` Martin Quarters '' painted in black offer the only clue that they 're not stuffed with cargo . \nThis barge is a floating hotel , or `` flotel , '' set up by BP and several subcontractors to accommodate more than 500 workers hired to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nTemporary housing is the only way to station workers at Port Fourchon , a massive shipyard that serves offshore oil rigs and is surrounded by ecologically sensitive marshes and beaches . \n`` There are no permanent residents here on the port , '' said Dennis Link , a manager from a BP refinery who 's handling logistics at the 1,300-acre site that 's easily accessible by ship , but reachable on land only by a state road that snakes through the bayous . \nWith the ambitious `` top kill '' having failed over the weekend and a relief well at least two months away , BP was ramping up its efforts to clean up the Louisiana coast . \nAnother temporary fix -- an effort to saw through the pipe leaking the oil and cap it -- could be tried as soon as Wednesday . \nIn the meantime , more than 125 miles of the state 's coastline already have been hit with oil , including the resort of Grand Isle near Port Fourchon . \nThe cleanup , relief wells and temporary fixes were being watched closely by President Barack Obama 's administration . \nObama planned to meet for the first time Tuesday with the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill , while Attorney General Eric Holder was headed to the Gulf Coast to meet with state attorneys general . \nOn Monday afternoon , the living quarters on the flotel sat empty . \nGenerators pumped in cool air and powered the lights , and at the foot of each bunk sat a towel , washcloth and individually wrapped bar of soap . \nIf necessary , four tents on dry land nearby can house 500 more workers . \nWorkers will likely be trucked in on the two-lane state road . \nThe accommodations on the barge are Spartan , but comfortable -- similar to military barracks . \nEach pod contains 12 bunks , with a bathroom for every four . \nPer Coast Guard standards , each resident gets 30 square feet of space in the quarters . \nThe barge has 10 washers , 10 dryers and a kitchen , although food will be served in a tent on land . \nThe quarters are typically floated alongside offshore oil rigs to supplement housing on the drilling operations . \nThe flotel could be moved if significant amounts of oil wash up at another location . \nAnother flotel sits about 15 miles away , off Grand Isle , and BP plans to establish them elsewhere along the coast . \nPort Fourchon and Grand Isle were quiet Monday , with only a handful of people seen walking on the beaches by an Associated Press reporter and photographer flying over in a helicopter . \nBP is hiring local workers and ones from other states , and Link acknowledged that some from Louisiana might prefer a long drive home each to staying on the flotel . \nFor Chad Martin , co-owner of Martin Quarters , business is booming . \nHis company has 200 living quarters , and 60 were available when a BP subcontractor called . \nThe oil giant rented every single one . \nBut Martin understands the gravity of the situation . \n`` This is not the way to get work , '' he said Cleanup efforts are being ramped up while BP also tries the latest in a series of patchwork fixes , this one a cut-and-cap process to put a lid on the leaking wellhead so oil can be siphoned to the surface . \nThe risky procedure could , at least temporarily , increase the oil flowing from the busted well . \nUsing robot submarines , BP plans to cut away the riser pipe this week and place a cap-like containment valve over the blowout preventer . \nOn Monday , live video feeds showed robot submarines moving equipment around and using a circular saw-like device to cut small pipes at the bottom of the Gulf . \nBP failed to plug the leak Saturday with its top kill , which shot mud and pieces of rubber into the well but could n't beat back the pressure of the oil . \nThe oil company also announced plans Monday to try attaching another pipe to a separate opening on the blowout preventer with some of the same equipment used to pump in mud during the top kill . \nThe company also wants to build a new freestanding riser to carry oil toward the surface , which would give it more flexibility to disconnect and then reconnect containment pipes if a hurricane passed through . \nNeither of those plans would start before mid-June and would supplement the cut-and-cap effort . \nBut the best chances for sealing off the leak are two relief wells , the first of which wo n't be ready until August . \nThe spill has already leaked between 19.7 million and 43 million gallons , according to government estimates . \nFor the relief well to succeed , the bore hole must precisely intersect the damaged well , which experts have compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate more than two miles into the earth . \nIf it misses , BP will have to back up its drill , plug the hole it just created , and try again . \n`` The probability of them hitting it on the very first shot is virtually nil , '' said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , who spent most of his 39 years in the oil industry in offshore exploration . \n`` If they get it on the first three or four shots they 'd be very lucky . '' \nThe trial-and-error process could take weeks , but it will eventually work , scientists and BP said . \nThen engineers will then pump mud and cement through pipes to ultimately seal the well . \nOn the slim chance the relief well does n't work , scientists were n't sure exactly how much -- or how long -- the oil would flow . \nThe gusher would continue until the well bore hole collapsed or pressure in the reservoir dropped to a point where oil was no longer pushed to the surface , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . \nBP said it does n't know how much oil is in the reservoir because it was starting to collect and analyze data on its size when the rig exploded April 20 . \nIn Patzek 's mind , failing to get the relief wells to work is n't an option . \n`` I do n't admit the possibility of it not working , '' he said . \n"}

Thad Allen , the national incident commander leading the government 's response to the spill , said Thursday that the condition of the wellbore , or the hole drilled to reach the oil field , is still unknown and is the reason that other failed efforts to cap the well were n't more rigorous . \n`` This document raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it . \nIt is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill , '' Markey said in a statement released with the document . \n`` BP needs to tell us what it will do if the wellbore is compromised and 100,000 barrels per day of oil spills into the ocean . \nAt this point , we need real contingency planning , '' Markey added . \n"}

'' \nBut BP spokesman Robert Wine said the break is Hayward 's first since the Deepwater Horizon rig that BP was leasing exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea gusher . \n`` He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend . \nI 'm sure that everyone would understand that , '' Wine said . \nIt 's questionable whether Hayward 's day off will change much of the clean-up effort on the ground . \nThousands of boats are on the water trying to collect the oil -- either to use or to burn . \nAbout 50 miles off Louisiana 's coast , a newly expanded containment system is capturing or incinerating more than 1 million gallons of oil daily , the first time it has approached its peak capacity , according to the Coast Guard . \nBP hopes that by late June it will keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from the broken pipe from hitting the ocean . \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates told `` Fox News Sunday '' that not all of the 17,500 National Guard that are awaiting deployment have been put into operation . \nBut even the Pentagon is limited in its ability to help . \n`` We have offered whatever capabilities we have . \nWe do n't have the kinds of equipment or particular expertise . \nI have authorized the mobilization of up to 17,500 National Guard troops in the four states that are -- that are most affected . \nWe have a standing offer . \nIf there 's anything people think we can do , we absolutely will do it , '' Gates said . \nThe spill is causing 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil to contaminate the Gulf of Mexico each day . \nOver 62 days , that 's anywhere from 2.1 million to 3.72 million gallons . \nBut one scientist said it would take the spill more than 700 million years for the amount of oil in the Gulf to equal the amount of water -- about 650 quadrillion gallons . \n`` This is not the death of the Gulf of Mexico , '' George Crozier , director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , told the Mobile -LRB- Ala. -RRB- Press-Register . \n`` If you went Gulf-wide with this and stirred it up in the Gulf of Mexico , I 'm not sure we could find it . '' \nBP has also paid out $ 104 million to Gulf residents harmed as a result of the spill . \nIt has also established a $ 20 billion fund , which Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , likened to a White House `` shakedown '' before retracting his comment in the face of outrage among his congressional caucus and others . \nDemocrats have already put Barton 's apology to BP into advertising for its midterm elections this fall . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "1278", "time": "2010-06-20", "text": "June 17 : Rep. Joe Barton asks a question at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , on Capitol Hill . \nReuters Rep. Joe Barton 's apology to BP Chief Tony Hayward for what he called a White House `` shakedown '' for demanding a $ 20 billion fund for damage claims has turned into a political football that Democrats are hoping to exploit . \nRepublicans were deeply embarrassed by Barton 's apology to BP during a House hearing Thursday , demanding that the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee retract his mea culpa or lose his seniority . \nBarton returned to the committee room and did just that . \nBut like the spill in the Gulf of Mexico , the lid was blown , and Republicans have been in damage control ever since . \n`` I could n't disagree with Joe Barton more . \nB.P. does n't need an apology . \nThey need to apologize to us , and they certainly need to cover all the costs of the cleanup and the economic damages as well . \nAnd they 're going -- they 're going to , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky . \nImmediately after Barton 's remarks , the Democratic National Committee created a television ad showing Barton making his apology while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran ads on Facebook . \nWhite House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel kept up the assault on Sunday . \n`` You can say it 's a political gift for us , and it is , '' Emanuel told ABC 's `` This Week . '' \n`` That 's not a political gaffe . \nThose were prepared remarks . \nThat is a philosophy . \nThat is an approach to what they see . \nThey see the aggrieved party here is BP , not the fishermen . '' \nEmanuel went further , linking Barton to any number of Republican candidates who think that `` government is the problem . '' \n`` This is not just one person . \nRand Paul , running for Senate in Kentucky , what did he say ? \nHe said the way BP was being treated was un-American , '' Emanuel said . \n`` Other members of the Republican leadership have come to the defense of BP and attacked the administration for forcing them to set up an escrow account and fund it to the level of $ 20 billion . '' \nEmanuel acknowledged that the Minerals Management Service , an agency within the Department of Interior , was lax in regulating the oil giant . \nNonetheless , he said , `` I think what Joe Barton did is remind the American people , in case they forgot , this is how the Republicans would govern . '' \nRepublicans , however , were not ready to lie down and take the onslaught . \nMcConnell said Obama is one of the largest recipients of BP donations . \nHe accused the administration of exploiting the spill to pass energy legislation . \nMcConnell added that the Democratic philosophy is that government is too big to fail . \n`` The president has been advocating expansion of government across the board in virtually every area . \nIf you 're going to advocate expansion of the government , then you look not so good when the government you 're already in charge of does n't function very well , '' he said . \n`` You know , the president himself is in charge of developing a contingency plan to deal with oil spills . \nWhat happened to it ? \nWe know there are skimmers around the world that could be sent here . \nThe administration has a role to play in this and they have n't done a very good job so far , '' McConnell added . \nSen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , also called Barton 's comment `` absolutely wrong , '' but warned against the administration `` running with this as the issue . '' \n`` Let 's not forget , we had 11 people die , and we have an environmental disaster unfolding and an economic disaster unfolding . \nLet 's not be distracted by saying , you know , Joe Barton made this gaffe or this inappropriate comment . \nLet 's focus on what we need to do , which is getting relief to the Gulf , making sure that they have every asset possible , and making sure we have a claims compensation system that works for them , '' she said on CNN . \nWith the glare of the spotlight on Barton 's words , Ken Feinberg , the man in charge of administering the $ 20 billion escrow fund for local businesses affected by the spill , suggested that the apology lacks merit to begin with . \n`` I do n't think it 's a shakedown ... But I do n't think it helps to politicize this program . \nThese people in the Gulf are in desperate straits , '' Feinberg said , noting that to its credit , BP was cooperating in paying out claims , having distributed $ 100 million so far . \nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , a Republican , added that the $ 20 billion is being set aside in $ 5 billion increments , which protects BP from having to give up so much working capital it ca n't carry out its pledge to clean up the Gulf . \n`` It 's good for BP . \nBP -- that was to their advantage to get taken out of the claims business . \nThe $ 20 billion , once it was done where BP could continue to operate as a going concern and pay their bills that they owe Louisiana , Mississippi , and Florida and Alabama , that also was a good deal for BP , '' said Barbour , who appeared with Feinberg on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' \nBarbour said that while he does n't think Barton 's apology was `` accurate , '' he does think the administration is going to try to redirect attention toward `` anything but this oil spill . '' \n`` They want to change the subject . \nAnd I can understand that , '' he said . \nBarbour added that he 's not afraid of being accused of being too close to the oil company now known for the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . \n`` You 're looking at a guy that has already told you 15 times today BP is responsible to pay every penny of this . \nWe expect them to pay every penny of this . \nWe 're going to demand they pay every penny of this . \nAnd if that makes me cozy with BP , it 's because I want to make sure that my people stay in their wallet and their checkbook .

'' \nOut at sea , the crew of the semi-submersible drilling vessel Helix Q4000 waited hours longer than expected to hoist the containment device from the deck of the Joe Griffin supply boat because dangerous fumes rose from the oily water . \nJoe Griffin Capt. Demi Shaffer told an Associated Press reporter aboard his boat the fear was that a spark caused by the scrape of metal on metal could cause a fire . \nCrew members wore respirators while they worked . \nConditions were safe enough to allow the crane to lift the device into the Gulf after 10 p.m. CDT , dark oil clinging to its white sides as it entered the water and disappeared below the surface . \nThe box -- which looks a lot like a peaked , four-story outhouse , especially on the inside , with its rough timber framing -- must be accurately positioned over the well , or it could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nBP spokesman Doug Suttles said he is not concerned about that happening . \nUnderwater robots have been clearing pieces of pipe and other debris near where the box will be placed to avoid complications . \n`` We do not believe it could make things worse , '' he said . \nOther risks include ice clogs in the pipes -- a problem that crews will try to prevent by continuously pumping in warm water and methanol -- and the danger of explosion when separating the mix of oil , gas and water that is brought to the surface . \n`` I 'm worried about every part , as you can imagine , '' said David Clarkson , BP vice president of engineering projects . \nIf the box works , a second one now being built may be used to deal with another , smaller leak from the sea floor . \nThat leak is coming from a cutoff valve that should have stopped the well from blowing out but did not . \nThe spill has the Minerals Management Service re-examining whether such valves , known as blowout preventers , are reliable enough , Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank said Friday . \nMeanwhile , a huge oil slick is floating in the Gulf , and residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida are anxiously waiting to learn when it might come ashore . \nSeas were calm Friday , and the Coast Guard hoped to continue skimming oil from the ocean surface , burning it at sea and dropping chemicals from the air to break it up . \nOil from the spill is extending west around the Mississippi Delta , according to a radar image taken Wednesday night by a Canadian satellite . \nThat extension looks like a finger reaching out from the main patch , imaging expert Hans Graber of the University of Miami said Friday . \nThe main oil slick has been shifting to the northwest , encroaching on Chandeleur Sound , which lies between the delicate Chandeleur Islands and Mississippi Delta wetlands , he said . \nA federal judicial panel in Washington has been asked to consolidate at least 65 potential class-action lawsuits claiming economic damage from the spill . \nCommercial fishermen , business and resort owners , charter boat captains , even would-be vacationers have sued from Texas to Florida , seeking damages that could reach into the billions . \n`` It 's just going to kill us . \nIt 's going to destroy us , '' said Dodie Vegas , who owns a motel and cabins in Grand Isle , La. , and has seen 10 guests cancel . \n"}

'' \nBy Sunday , the box the size of a house could be capturing up to 85 percent of the oil . \nSo far about 3 million gallons have leaked in an environmental crisis that has been unfolding since a deepwater drilling platform exploded April 20 , sending toxic oil toward a shoreline of marshes , shipping channels , fishing grounds and beaches . \nEleven workers were killed in the accident . \nThe lowering of the containment device was a slow-moving drama playing out 50 miles from Louisiana 's coast , requiring great precision and attention to detail . \nIt took about two weeks to build the 40-foot box , and the effort to lower it by crane and cable to the seafloor began late Thursday night . \nAfter it hit bottom Friday afternoon , the crane gradually eased off to allow it to settle . \n`` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Salvin said . \nThe task became increasingly urgent as toxic oil crept deeper into the bays and marshes of the Mississippi Delta . \nA sheen of oil began arriving on land last week , and crews have been putting out floating barriers , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to keep it from coming ashore . \nBut now the thicker , stickier goo -- arrayed in vivid , brick-colored ribbons -- is drawing ever closer to Louisiana 's coastal communities . \nThere are still untold risks and unknowns with the containment box : The approach has never been tried at such depths , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine , and any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nThe seafloor is pitch black and the water murky , though lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working . \nIf the box works , another one will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak at the bottom of the Gulf . \nAt the same time , crews are drilling sideways into the well in hopes of plugging it up with mud and concrete , and they are working on other ways to cap it . \nThe well has been spewing about 200,000 gallons a day in the nation 's biggest oil spill since the nearly 11 million gallons lost in the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . \nThe cause of the blast has not been determined , but investigators have been focusing on the so-called blowout preventer . \nFederal regulators told The Associated Press that they are going to examine whether these last-resort cutoff valves on offshore oil wells are reliable . \nAt Hopedale , a fishing community in St. Bernard Parish , La. , that has been a staging area for efforts to protect inlets and bayous , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal stepped out of a helicopter and held aloft a tennis ball-size hunk of tarry oil he said a fisherman had retrieved near the mouth of the Mississippi River . \nOil was reported moving west of the Mississippi toward fishing and resort villages on the Louisiana coast . \nAfter a flyover , Jindal described the orange and brown goo surrounding Louisiana 's Chandeleur Islands as resembling `` a ring around your bathtub . '' \nSeveral members of Congress flew over the spill and then visited Hopedale on Friday as well . \nU.S. Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n, chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee , said hearings on the explosion will start next week . \n`` Lives were lost , livelihoods ruined , '' Markey said . \n`` The lessons that will be learned will become laws . '' \nBP plans to sell the petroleum it recovers after separating out the large amounts of natural gas and seawater -- something that industry experts said should not present much of a problem . \n`` That 's something they do for every oil well , '' said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of petroleum geoscience programs at the University of Houston . \n`` They 'll refine it and crack it and everything , and by the time it gets in your gas tank , you 'll never even know it was in the water . '' \nThe oil 's planned destination , BP 's Texas City , Texas , refinery , has its own checkered history . \nAn explosion there in 2005 killed 15 people and injured 170 . \nRegulators last October hit BP with a record $ 87 million fine for safety violations . \nMay 6 : The oil containment box is lowered into the Gulf at the site of the Deepwater Horizon rig collapse . \nMay 5 : A ship enters the Gulf of Mexico carrying the oil containment vessel to the rig collapse site . \n"}

'' \nIt 's clear the president and the radical environmentalists in his administration do n't feel the same way . \nAnd joining me now with more is the former speaker of the House , Fox News contributor , co-producer of the documentary , `` Nine Days That Changed the World , '' former speaker , Newt Gingrich . \nNEWT GINGRICH , FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : Good to be with you . \nHANNITY : All right . \nFirst of all , what do you make of the -- it really is frustrating to me because none of this grandstanding is going to help plug the damn hole . \nAnd none of this is going to clean up the Gulf , save jobs , save tourism , fishing . \nSo I found this whole exercise today frankly obnoxious and I think it has to be related to the campaign 138 days from now . \nGINGRICH : Well , I -- look , there 's so many different things wrong right now that it 's a little hard to put them all on one TV show . \nGINGRICH : By what -- yes , I mean -- well , just to start with this compensation fund . \nIs this an effort by BP to avoid potentially lawsuits of much more money ? \nHow did they arrive at $ 20 billion ? \nWas Obama the person who picked $ 20 billion ? \nHow would he know ? \nShould it have been $ 10 billion or $ 40 billion ? \nIs the president really going to appoint a political crony to run this compensation fund ? \nI mean , has America degenerated into a Venezuelan-style country where the leader gets to pick somebody to hand out $ 20 billion and we think that 's not going to be corrupt ? \nAll of this is outside the law . \nWe have bank -- we have laws for suits that the Congress could create and the president could sign ; a bill that have some kind of compensation process . \nBut to have it handled by press release ? \nThis is the kind of stuff that 's going to convince every major business in the world to avoid the United States , to invest outside the United States because our political class seems to have lost any sense of balance and any sense of the rule of law . \nHANNITY : If we want stay just technically for a second on the law and stay away from the politics for a minute , we already have a law . \nIt 's the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . \nAnd it very specifically says that -- that the company responsible will be responsible and will have liability for all removal costs . \nAnd then they have a cap of 75 million unless there 's some type of negligence proven . \nSo BP did not have to do this . \nAnd there 's questions about whether or not in the end they 're going to be able to fund all this or go bankrupt . \nGINGRICH : Well , but first of all I think you have to assume that BP is going to be proven negligent . \nThis was a terrible mistake . \nAnd it 's clearly BP 's fault . \nHANNITY : Well , but the words in the law are gross negligence and willful misconduct . \nBut every step of the way our federal government had to approve everything that BP was doing . \nGINGRICH : OK , yes , but Sean , you know , I spent three years at Tulane in New Orleans . \nMy younger daughter Jackie Kushner was born in New Orleans . \nGINGRICH : Would you like to go to -- would you like to go to a jury trial in Louisiana right now as BP and have the U.S. attorney -- have the U.S. attorney charge you with gross negligence ? \nWould you like to bet on your odds of getting off ? \nThey 're going to -- they 're going to lose this . \nHANNITY : They probably would . \nBut we 've got to be fair and objective here . \nAnd the fair objective is , is that the government approved the lease . \nThe government has an inspection process which we 've since realized they 've ignored . \nThe government approved every action that they took out there in the Gulf . \nGross negligence would also -- or malfeasance would also -- that burden would be on the government , too , would it not ? \nThe government would have to prove it . \nBut look , I believe both bureaucracies have been incompetent . \nI believe the BP bureaucracy was incompetent . \nGINGRICH : And has been every -- and has been every single day since the disaster . \nI believe the United States government is incompetent and has been every single day since the disaster . \nIf you listen to Governor Jindal , he -- or you listen to James Carville , a Democrat -- they 're vivid in their description of how bad the government has been . \nI think the president is desperately playing PR games but he 's killing jobs while he does it . \nHe killed jobs the other day , by putting in a freeze that was totally unnecessary on current activity in the Gulf . \nThey had 30,000 wells in the Gulf . \nThey 've had one problem in the last -- since World War II out of 30,000 wells . \nThe president is going to kill the industry in Louisiana if he 's not careful . \nYou have -- in fact it turned out today in the lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal that the experts the White House claimed favored their position have unanimously repudiated it and said that it 's false , they did n't do it , and in fact , they think this makes it more dangerous because it sends all of the people out of the Gulf who know what they 're doing . \nHANNITY : Look , and for my mind , there 's plenty of time for finger - pointing . \nThere 's plenty of time for blaming . \nThere 's going to be plenty of time for lawsuits . \nBut we 're not -- even to this stage , 60 days into this , we are not taking the action that is necessary to help solve the problem . \nIf you look at the front cover of Drudge , it links to a story `` Against Governor Jindal 's wishes , crude sucking barges were stopped by our Coast Guard . '' \nWe still have not put a lift on the Jones Act and we still have 13 countries that we have now learned from three days in after the explosion that offered help , that we have n't accepted their help and assistance for this . \nThat seems to me -- our priorities seem all screwed up here . \nAnd that 's what 's frustrating . \nGINGRICH : I think -- I think the Obama administration handling of phase II . \nPhase I is a disaster which is BP 's fault . \nPhase II is the cleanup . \nI think the Obama administration has handled this worse and more incompetently than any major crisis I can remember in recent American history . \nEverything you just said is true . \nI have a number of friends in Louisiana who 've been keeping me briefed . \nAnd their level of anger at this administration is almost unspeakable . \nBecause they see things like , the Corps of Engineers blocking the Coast Guard . \nIt turns out that building berms to block the oil was in the Coast Guard 's original plan . \nAnd yet the Corps of Engineers has blocked another branch of the federal government . \nThe point you just made , many foreign countries offered to loan us technical skills . \nIt was n't taken advantage of . \nThe point I just made : You look at the president 's commission , there is no deep drilling expert on the entire commission . \nGINGRICH : And the president has this -- he has an affectation or an affection for academic professors who write books , but he does n't understand about the real world and real effectiveness . \nHANNITY : Do you agree with me that I think the biggest problem we have here is that the environmental movement that pushed us offshore because we could n't drill in ANWR or in shallower waters -- the environmental movement that would n't allow us to burn which was pre-approved , that would n't allow chemical disbursements , we could n't put aside our political differences to allow the Dutch skimmers that would have taken out 20,000 tons of sludge a day , probably from the first week moving forward . \nDo you think that they 're controlling everything here ? \nDo you think there 's another hidden agenda here that the president is so beholden to them that he does n't -- GINGRICH : I think he 's -- I think this is just pure incompetence . \nGINGRICH : I do n't think it 's an agenda . \nI think it 's incompetence . \nWell , this is -- this is incompetence that we will pay for for decades . \nAll right , we 'll take a break . \nI have a lot of questions for you when we get back . \nHANNITY : And we continue now with former Speaker of the HouseNewt Gingrich . \nMr. Speaker , there is -- we have the show on Capitol Hill today . \nAnd Joe Barton , congressman , said you know what ? \nThis is a shakedown . \nWe have a lot of other congressmen , you know , debating whether or not the White House is exceeding their constitutional authority by demanding that BP put all this money in escrow when in fact we have a law in place . \nDoes that question mean anything to you ? \nGINGRICH : Well , sure it does . \nI think the reports I 've seen so far , that the president 's claiming that he was responsible for this . \nBP is claiming they were going to do it anyway . \nBut let 's say the president was responsible . \nBy what right does a politician decide that $ 20 billion is the right number ? \nWhy was n't it 30 or 40 ? \nHANNITY : Well , that 's a down payment . \nHANNITY : They left open the door . \nIt 's going to be a heck of a lot more . \nGINGRICH : I think it will be a lot more . \nBut I just think the idea that if the president is directly engaged in extorting money from a company , this is like General Motors and Chrysler where the administration basically stole money from the creditors who own stock and who had bonds to give that money to their union allies . \nAnd what it 's going to -- what it says to the world is , be very careful about investing in the United States because the political class may take the money away from you if the trial lawyers do n't get it first . \nI think that kills more jobs . \nMakes it harder to recover . \nHANNITY : Look , we 're 138 days out of an election . \nI think this is going to be a huge political liability for the president and all those people that have supported him all along the way since he 's been elected in 2008 . \nIf you had to go back to day one in all of this , and I 'm not saying 20\\/20 hindsight , what would you have done ? \nIf you were in charge and if you were put in charge tomorrow , what would you do ? \nBecause obviously it 'd be a little bit different . \nGINGRICH : Look , look . \nThose are two totally different situations . \nWhat the president should have done at the end of the first week was assign people to reach out across the planet to find every technical expert available on two topics . \nOne is , what do you do about capping the well and stopping the oil flow ? \nAnd the other is , what do you do about cleanups ? \nNow the first thing you 'll discover is most of the experts are in the private sector , which of course if you are a left-wing Democrat it 's very hard to imagine . \nSo you 've actually have to reach out to all the people who actually do this work for a living because they 're the only people with real experience . \nThe second thing I would do is you 'd call as many experts as you could to a meeting in Washington . \nYou 'd have Shell executives who 17 years ago used super tankers to clean up the Middle East . \nYou would have the Dutch facilities , you 'd have the Norwegian and Swedish facilities , you have the Japanese facilities . \nYou get them all in a room and you say , `` We need a plan to throw everything we can to cleaning up the oil so it does n't reach the shore . '' \nAnd you go to overkill . \nYou do more than you need do to stop the oil from coming back into the United States and hitting the shore . \nThe next you do is you order the Corps of Engineers to get out of the way . \nWhen you realize the Corps of Engineers took longer to do an environmental assessment of buildings some islands , barrier islands , than it took the oil to reach shore . \nI mean if your environmental assessment takes longer than it takes to damage the environment , that 's a bureaucracy that 's stupid beyond belief . \nGINGRICH : And it 's a good argument for fundamentally overhauling the Corps of Engineers . \nSo there were a number of action items that could have been done from day one . \nAnd you would have integrated , frankly , Governor Jindal in the decision-process . \nAnd the president should have been having a video conference every morning with the Gulf Coast governors to get -- and eyes on assessment by the people elected by the local community . \nHANNITY : What would you do now ? \nI mean at this point , this late in the game , oil coming onshore , the hole has still not been plugged , where -- would you start there then at this moment ? \nGINGRICH : You 've got to now , I think , good move in parallel on three fronts . \nYou 've got to do whatever it takes to plug the hole and you 've got to do them in parallel . \nYou ca n't do one thing and then wait a week and do another thing and then wait a week and do another thing . \nYou say , `` Tell me every possible device we could use . \nGet all of them here simultaneously . '' \nEven though that means you 're wasting some money get them here at once and let 's go at it head-on as fast as we can the way we fought World War II , which is to throw everything at a problem until you drown it . \nThe second you got to do , call the countries that have given you ideas and opportunities and say yes , let 's stop the oil still coming out from getting to the beaches . \nAnd most of the oil , remember , is still offshore and you could be cleaning it up . \nHANNITY : All right , Mr. Speaker , appreciate you being with us . \nI ca n't believe the president still does n't seem to get . \n-- Watch `` Hannity '' weeknights at 9 p.m. ET ! \nContent and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. . \nAll materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , displayed , published or broadcast without the prior written permission of Roll Call . \nYou may not alter or remove any trademark , copyright or other notice from copies of the content . \n"}

'' \nThe design was used on the well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 , killing 11 workers and causing America 's worst offshore oil spill . \nThe only other major well design , which is more expensive , includes more safeguards against a natural-gas blowout of the kind that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon . \nA Wall Street Journal analysis of records provided by the U.S. Minerals Management Service shows that BP used the less costly design -- called `` long string '' -- on 35 percent of its deepwater wells since July 2003 , the earliest date the well-design data were available . \nAnadarko used it on 42 percent of its deepwater Gulf wells , though it says it does n't do so in wells of the type drilled by BP . \nBP chief executive officer Tony Hayward said in a statement that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations `` These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , '' Hayward said . \n`` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . '' \nBoth companies used the design much more often , on average , than other major Gulf drillers . \nOut of 218 deepwater wells in the Gulf drilled since July 2003 , 26 percent used the long-string design . \nIt derives its name from its use of a single , long `` string '' of pipe from the sea floor to the bottom of the well . \nOther big drillers use long-string design less frequently than BP , according to the Journal 's data analysis . \nRoyal Dutch Shell PLC used long string designs on 8 percent of its wells and Chevron Corp. on 15 percent . \nAustralian firm BHP Billiton PLC used long string on 4 percent of its wells . \n"}

{"id": "697", "time": "2010-06-18", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Vast amounts of natural gas contained in crude escaping from the blown Gulf of Mexico oil well could pose a serious threat to marine life by creating `` dead zones '' where oxygen is so depleted that nothing lives . \nThe danger presented by the methane has been largely overlooked , with early efforts to monitor the oil spill focusing on the more toxic components of oil . \nBut scientists are increasingly worried about the gas that can suffocate sea creatures in high concentrations . \nAt least 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas -- and possibly almost twice that amount -- have leaked since April 20 . \nThat 's based on estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey 's `` flow team '' that 2,900 cubic feet of natural gas are escaping for every barrel of oil . \n`` This is the most vigorous methane eruption in modern human history , '' said John Kessler , a Texas A&M University oceanographer . \nScientists , including those working with the flow team , estimate that methane makes up between 40 percent and 70 percent of what is spilling into the Gulf . \nSmall microbes that live in the sea have been feeding on the oil and natural gas in the water and are consuming larger quantities of oxygen , which they need to digest food . \nAs they draw more oxygen from the water , it creates two problems . \nWhen oxygen levels drop low enough , the breakdown of oil grinds to a halt ; and as it is depleted in the water , most life ca n't be sustained . \nMethane is a colorless , odorless and flammable substance that is a major component in the natural gas used to heat people 's homes . \nPetroleum engineers typically burn off excess gas attached to crude before the oil is shipped off to the refinery . \nThat 's exactly what BP is doing with gas it started capturing from the leak 15 days ago . \nA BP spokesman said the company was burning about 30 million cubic feet of natural gas daily on a ship at the surface , adding up to about 450 million cubic feet since the containment effort started . \nBut that figure does not account for gas that eluded containment efforts and wound up in the water , leaving behind huge amounts of methane . \nScientists are still trying to determine how it could damage the Gulf and its creatures . \nThe high-pressure seafloor leak is spewing like a fire hose , causing oil and gas to dissolve into tiny droplets that are less likely to rise to the surface . \nAdding to the effect , more than a million gallons of chemical dispersants have been pumped into the gusher by BP -- a bid to stop oil from reaching the coast that comes at the expense of the Gulf 's deeper waters . \nThe National Science Foundation funded research on methane in the Gulf amid concerns about the depths of the oil plume and questions what role natural gas was playing in keeping the oil below the surface , said David Garrison , a program director in the federal agency who specializes in biological oceanography . \n`` This has the potential to harm the ecosystem in ways that we do n't know , '' Garrison said . \n`` It 's a complex problem . '' \nIn early June , a research team led by Samantha Joye of the Institute of Undersea Research and Technology at the University of Georgia investigated a 15-mile-long plume drifting southwest from the leak site . \nThey said they found methane concentrations up to 10,000 times higher than normal , and oxygen levels depleted by 40 percent or more . \nThe scientists found that some parts of the plume had oxygen concentrations just shy of the level that tips ocean waters into the category of `` dead zone '' -- a region uninhabitable to fish , crabs , shrimp and other marine creatures . \nKessler has encountered similar findings . \nSince he began his on-site research on Saturday , he said he has already found oxygen depletions of between 2 percent and 30 percent in waters 1,000 feet deep . \nShallow waters are normally more susceptible to oxygen depletion . \nBecause it is being found in such deep waters , both Kessler and Joye do not know what is causing the depletion and what the impact could be in the long - or short-term . \nIn an e-mail , Joye called her findings `` the most bizarre looking oxygen profiles I have ever seen anywhere . '' \nRepresentatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration acknowledged that so much methane in the water could draw down oxygen levels and slow the breakdown of oil in the Gulf , but cautioned that research was still under way to understand the ramifications . \n`` We have n't seen any long-term changes or trends at this point , '' said Robert Haddad , chief of the agency 's assessment and restoration division . \nHaddad said early efforts to monitor the spill had focused largely on the more toxic components of oil . \nHowever , as new data comes in , he said NOAA and other federal agencies will get a more accurate read on methane concentrations and the effects . \n`` The question is what 's going on in the deeper , colder parts of the ocean , '' he said . \n`` Are the -LRB- methane -RRB- concentrations going to overcome the amount of available oxygen ? \nWe want to make sure we 're not overloading the system . '' \nBP spokesman Mark Proegler disputed Joye 's suggestion that the Gulf 's deep waters contain large amounts of methane , noting that water samples taken by BP and federal agencies have shown minimal underwater oil outside the spill 's vicinity . \n`` The gas that escapes , what we do n't flare , goes up to the surface and is gone , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "1075", "time": "2010-06-18", "text": "June 17 : BP CEO Tony Hayward testifies during a House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee hearing on the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon Explosion and oil spill , on Capitol Hill in Washington . \nAP NEW ORLEANS -- BP 's chairman said Friday that CEO Tony Hayward is on his way out as the company 's point man on the Gulf oil spill crisis , a day after Hayward enraged members of Congress by offering few answers about how the environmental disaster happened . \nOther BP officials , however , said the switch had been previously announced and will not take place for some time . \nBP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg told Britain 's Sky News television on Friday that Hayward `` is now handing over the operations , the daily operations to -LRB- BP Managing Director -RRB- Bob Dudley . '' \nBP had said this month that Dudley would take over the long-term response to the spill once the leak was stopped , but millions of gallons continue to spew and that milestone remains months away . \nSvanberg 's statement sowed confusion , with other BP officials saying Hayward remains in charge . \n`` Until the acute part of this crisis is over , until the leak is capped , Tony Hayward is still very much in charge in the response of this crisis , '' BP spokesman Robert Wine said . \nWine said Hayward `` will at some point hand over the management of the aftermath , '' and that Dudley is putting together a team that will `` make sure that the long-term impacts are met with as well as the legal , political repercussions from this crisis . '' \nThere is no date for the handover , Wine said , because `` clearly the well is still leaking . '' \nThe chairman 's comments overshadowed some positive news in the cleanup effort . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced earlier Friday that a newly expanded containment system is capturing or incinerating more than 1 million gallons of oil daily , the first time it has approached its peak capacity . \nAnd the system will soon grow . \nBy late June , the oil giant hopes it can keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from hitting the ocean . \nBut the massive leak , set off by an oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers nearly two months ago , will not be stopped completely until at least August . \nBP has been hammered for its response , in part because of comments by Hayward that Gulf Coast residents horrified by the spill consider insensitive . \nHayward shocked residents in slick-hit Louisiana by saying , `` I would like my life back . '' \nThe Briton was quoted by the Times of London suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims -- a statement that gained significance Friday when a House committee said BP has paid less than 12 percent of claims submitted . \nPresident Barack Obama has suggested he would fire Hayward if he could . \nOn Thursday , Hayward told lawmakers on a U.S. House investigations panel that he was out of the loop on decisions surrounding the blown well . \nBoth Democrats and Republicans were infuriated when he asserted , `` I 'm not stonewalling . '' \n`` It is clear that Tony has made remarks that have upset people , '' said Svanberg , who made a misstep of his own this week when he said BP cares `` about the small people . '' \nBut he added that Hayward `` is also a man who has probably been on 100 hours of TV time and maybe 500 . '' \nDudley , an American-born oil man with more than 30 years in the industry , has been BP 's managing director since 2009 . \nHis responsibilities include broad oversight of the company 's activities in the Americas and Asia , and earlier this month he was named head of the company 's disaster management unit . \nThe company said in a June 4 news release that Dudley would manage the long-term day-to-day operations of the oil spill response `` once the spill was over , '' and that he would report to Hayward . \nBP said then that the shift was being planned because it wants Hayward to focus on running the company and Dudley to focus on managing `` the reputational impact , the financial obligations and restore trust and confidence of BP in America . '' \nSvanberg told Sky News that no matter who is heading BP 's oil spill response , `` as long as we do n't close the well and take care of this , there will be criticisms about many things . '' \nMany Gulf Coast residents and business owners who have been economically devastated by the spill are still waiting for compensation from BP . \nThe House Judiciary Committee said data it has collected shows that BP has paid $ 71 million out of an estimated $ 600 million in outstanding claims as of Tuesday . \nIt based the figure on data it collected from BP 's daily reports to the Coast Guard on claims and on discussions with BP . \nThe committee said not one of the 717 claims for bodily injury , or the 175 claims for diminished home property value , have been paid . \n`` I remain concerned that BP is stiffing too many victims and shortchanging others , '' said the committee 's chairman , Michigan Democrat John Conyers . \nBP spokesman Scott Dean said in an e-mail that the company had paid out $ 95 million as of Friday , and it had written about 30,000 checks to settle about half the 63,000 claims it has received . \nThe chief of the Independent Claims Facility -- the newly created office charged with distributing $ 20 billion in compensation from BP -- said a plan to handle the remaining damage claims will be in place in 30 to 45 days . \nKenneth Feinberg said he hopes to have a program going forward that would provide payment within 30 to 60 days of someone submitting a new claim . \nThose pledges do n't mean much to Jerry Forte , who filed a business claim with BP more than a month ago and has n't seen a dime . \nHis seafood processing business on the docks in Pass Christian , Miss. , used to bring in more than $ 1 million a year but now is practically shuttered . \n`` I 'm 99 percent down . \nThey took all the shrimp boats . \nI do n't have anybody shrimping , '' Forte said Friday . \n`` My bank accounts are all going down to nothing because we 're spending it all on bills , just waiting on BP . '' \nThe slow claims process is just one of many criticisms lawmakers and the public have had with BP 's response to the spill -- and many of the toughest complaints have been directed at Hayward . \nRep. Bart Stupak , D-Mich . \n, said the CEO 's `` evasive and obstructive '' responses during Thursday 's congressional testimony further damaged BP 's reputation . \n`` Whether this change in Gulf leadership for BP will be productive remains to be seen , '' Stupak said in a statement . \n`` I expect that Mr. Dudley will take a much more cooperative and open approach to answering our questions and responding to the needs of the Gulf region . \nIf not , his tenure will likely be as short lived as Mr. Hayward 's . '' \nAlso Friday , an oil company that owns a quarter of BP 's blown-out oil well , blasted BP for `` reckless decisions and actions '' that led to the well 's explosion . \nChairman and CEO Jim Hackett 's statement came after some elected officials said Anadarko should help pay for the massive cleanup and spill-related claims . \nCompany spokesman John Christiansen said the comments were in response to `` a week 's worth of testimony '' and other information and data compiled on the disaster . \nThe recent oil containment efforts are a rare bit of good news for BP and suggest that its engineers are getting better at trapping oil after a two-month string of failures with equipment that clogged , proved ineffective or was simply abandoned . \n`` This is a significant improvement moving forward , '' said Adm. Allen , the top federal official in charge of the spill . \nBut there 's still much that can go wrong , from strained hoses breaking to ships colliding in the crowded seas over the leak . \nA bolt of lightning hit a drill ship this week , starting a fire and halting oil collection for hours . \nStopping the leak will require a pair of relief wells that are not expected to be ready until August , although drilling has gone faster than expected . \n`` Certainly stopping it is the first step and the important thing anyone can do , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental studies at Louisiana State University . \n`` Mother Nature can handle a lot of insult . \nIt 's just when you pile it and pile it and pile it . '' \nEven if the new containment systems are a success , it could take months for those living along the Gulf Coast to notice any improvement . \nExperts say oil could be washing up for another six months , and it may take years for wildlife populations harmed by the spill to rebound to levels seen before the leak . \nTo collect oil , BP now has a containment cap sitting over a well bore that is siphoning oil and gas to a drill ship on the ocean surface . \nSeparate lines are pulling oil and gas from beneath a stack of pipes above the seafloor to a drilling rig where the flow is burned . \nEngineers have been working since Wednesday to bring that system to full speed . \nThe ability to contain oil should grow as BP and the federal government move toward getting oil-trapping equipment in place that could better withstand Gulf hurricanes . \nIn addition , BP wants to take off the existing cap in July and replace it with one of three possible designs that would offer a tighter seal and siphon oil to two ships waiting above . \nCutting back on the flow would give cleanup crews some breathing room . \nFor example , the Coast Guard has put an emphasis on skimming the heavy oil as close to the damaged well as possible , before it breaks into thousands of smaller , unpredictable slicks that meander with the weather and can elude or outpace skimmers as they are pushed to shore . \nBut if the oil flow was substantially reduced , about 15 offshore skimmers could start chasing ribbons of oil -- sometimes as long as 60 miles -- that spread away from the leak site , said Coast Guard Rear Adm. James Watson , who coordinates day-to-day oil spill operations . \nWatson was n't ready to make any plans just yet . \n`` I 've tempered my optimism over time with this spill , '' he said . \n"}
{"id": "1306", "time": "2010-09-02", "text": "Aug. 3 : In this image taken from video provided by BP PLC , the new 75-ton cap sits atop the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP NEW ORLEANS -- Engineers removed a temporary cap Thursday that stopped oil from gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from BP 's blown-out well in mid-July . \nNo more oil was expected to leak into the sea , but crews were standing by with collection vessels just in case . \nThe cap was removed as a prelude to raising the massive piece of equipment underneath that failed to prevent the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe government wants to replace the failed blowout preventer first to deal with any pressure that is caused when a relief well BP has been drilling intersects the blown-out well . \nOnce that intersection occurs sometime after Labor Day , BP is expected to use mud and cement to plug the blown-out well for good from the bottom . \nThe April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to 206 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's well . \nBP was leasing the rig from owner Transocean Ltd. . \nAs the cap was slowly removed at 4:25 p.m. CDT , hours after a pipe latched to the top of it , there was no sight of anything spewing into the water . \nUndersea video feeds showed the cap suspended in the water . \nBP planned to place the cap on the seafloor nearby . \nWith the cap gone , the old blowout preventer can be removed and a new one put in place before engineers try to seal the well for good deep underground . \nOnce the blowout preventer is removed , a lot will be riding on the stability of a plug that was created when mud and cement were pumped down into the well from the top . \nEssentially , the pressure exerted downward served to counter the pressure coming up . \nBut Rice University engineering professor George Hirasaki said there is still uncertainty about whether the cement settled everywhere it needed to in order to keep oil and gas from finding its way up . \n`` Just because it did n't flow when they tested it does n't mean the cement displaced all of the oil and gas , '' Hirasaki said . \nThat 's why many people have felt that finishing a relief well and pumping mud and cement in through the bottom would be the ultimate solution to the crisis , said Hirasaki , who was involved in the oil containment effort in the Bay Marchand field off Louisiana after a rig burned in the early 1970s . \nThe government still plans on ordering BP PLC , the majority owner of the well , to do the so-called bottom kill operation . \nBut it believes the wisest course is to put on a new blowout preventer first to deal with any pressure that is caused when the relief well intersects the blown-out well . \nAnother potential risk : What happens if the crane attached to the blowout preventer accidentally drops the 50-foot , 300-ton device onto the wellhead ? \nBy itself , that might not cause more oil to spew , as long as the plug held , but it would make it difficult to continue the operation , Hirasaki said . \n`` It would crush everything , '' he said . \n`` It would be hard to place another blowout preventer on top of it . \nRight now the wellhead condition is in good condition . \nBut if you dropped it , everything could be opened up . '' \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the oil spill response , told reporters Wednesday during a visit to BP 's U.S. offices in Houston that engineers believe the crane will be able to handle the weight of the blowout preventer and some fragile pipe that is believed to be lodged inside . \nBut if the crane were to swing like a pendulum , that could cause problems , which is why officials have been waiting for rough seas at the site to calm down before continuing with removal of the blowout preventer . \nWith the cap now removed , the Helix Q4000 will soon latch its hooks onto the blowout preventer and wait for instructions to begin lifting it up . \nEngineers are prepared to exert a tremendous amount of pressure to get the blowout preventer free , but they must be careful not to damage it because it is a key piece of evidence in ongoing investigations . \nAllen said there is no `` significant risk '' of more oil leaking into the environment . \nBut he said that after the cap and blowout preventer are removed , `` The goal there will be to secure the annulus as quick as we can . '' \nThe annulus is an area between the inner piping and the outer casing . \nBased on an updated timeline Allen released Wednesday , the blowout preventer could begin being raised late Thursday or early Friday . \nBut Allen cautioned that timeline could be stretched again if high seas continue to kick up . \nThe final plugging of the well is n't expected until after Labor Day . \nA 12-person government evidence team is waiting to take possession of the blowout preventer when it reaches the surface . \n"}

'' \nMany influential investors appear to agree . \nAccording to Thomson Reuters , 23 firms with $ 1 billion or more invested in the stock market , including BlackRock Investment Management , Managed Account Advisors and Rydex Security Global Investors , more than doubled their holdings of BP stock from July through September . \nAt $ 44.11 , BP 's stock price has risen 63 percent from its low of $ 27.02 on June 25 . \nIt 's still down 27 percent from its close of $ 60.48 on April 20 , the day of the spill . \nThe well was capped on July 15 . \nThe AP analysis shows the company is likely to face $ 38 billion to $ 60 billion in spill-related costs . \nA settlement with the federal government could reduce that amount , while a successful class-action lawsuit could add billions more . \n-- The $ 10.7 billion that BP already has paid to plug its well , clean up the spilled oil and pay damage claims and other costs . \n-- A $ 20 billion fund that BP set up in August for individuals and private businesses that were affected by the spill . \nThe fund , known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , pays for environmental damage , personal injury , cleanup and lost earnings . \nThe fund so far has paid $ 2.7 billion to address nearly 168,000 claims . \nNearly half a million individuals and businesses have filed claims , and those that settle with the fund give up their right to sue the company . \nIf any of the $ 20 billion is left over , it goes back to BP . \n-- Fines : The Justice Department is suing BP for violating the Clean Water Act . \nFines are based on how much oil was spilled . \nThe government 's estimate of 4.9 million barrels means BP faces between $ 5.4 billion and $ 21.1 billion in fines . \nThe upper limit applies if investigators conclude BP acted with gross negligence . \nThe government has a history of settling with companies for as little as 50 cents on the dollar in order to avoid lengthy disputes , says Eric Schaeffer , former head of the Environmental Protection Agency 's enforcement division . \n-- Legal fees : BP has hired lawyers , engineers and geologists to defend the company . \nThese experts could cost as much as $ 2 billion , according to Mitratech Inc. , a consulting firm that handles legal and trial logistics for Fortune 500 companies . \n-- Lawsuits : The toughest costs to estimate are future settlements and judgments from the hundreds of lawsuits filed against BP , including any class actions . \nShrimpers , oystermen , charter-boat operators , restaurant workers and real-estate developers are suing BP for lost business . \nOil rig workers and cleanup crews are making personal injury claims . \nAnd Gulf states and local governments are expected to sue for lost tax revenue and environmental damages . \nAlabama is seeking an initial $ 148 million from BP . \nAnalysts at Citigroup say settlements , judgments and punitive damages from these suits will total as much as $ 6 billion . \nLegal experts caution that the unpredictability of juries makes it difficult to estimate the cost of losing a class-action lawsuit . \nA successful class-action could easily double the Citigroup estimate for total legal liabilities , says Alexandra Lahav , a University of Connecticut professor who studies such lawsuits . \nBP may be able to spread the spill 's costs around . \nMinority partners Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and MOEX 2007 LLC own 35 percent of the operation , and rig owner Transocean Ltd. also may be asked to pay . \n`` Companies have the incentive to settle with BP to put the matter behind them , '' FBR analyst Robert MacKenzie says . \nHe expects BP to get as much as $ 2 billion from Transocean and as much as $ 4 billion from Anadarko . \nSince the spill , BP has moved aggressively to shore up its finances . \nThe company suspended its quarterly dividend of 84 cents a share , which cost it $ 10.5 billion last year . \nIt also raised $ 21 billion in asset sales that include : $ 7 billion for its stake in Pan American Energy ; $ 7 billion for oil fields in the U.S. , Canada and Egypt ; $ 1.9 billion for its Colombian exploration business ; and $ 1.8 billion for assets in Vietnam and Venezuela . \nBP also raised $ 3.5 billion in an Oct. 1 . \nFrom April through June , when BP 's stock was tanking , Fred Fromm , who manages a natural resources fund for Franklin Templeton Investments , scooped up 170,000 shares . \nTheir value climbed by more than $ 2 million in the third quarter . \nA few weeks after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , scientists worried the oil slick would reach the Gulf 's Loop Current , which sweeps around Florida and up the East Coast . \nBeaches would be damaged along the way . \nBut BP got lucky . \nGulf winds kept shifting , which kept the oil concentrated in the waters south of Louisiana , said David Hollander , a University of South Florida chemical oceanographer . \nAnd hurricanes mostly avoided the region . \nScientists disagree about how much oil remains in the Gulf , but already the streaky sheens of oil on the surface are mostly gone . \nThe more oil that remains , the greater the potential for environmental lawsuits . \nWhatever remains , `` it wo n't impact their long-term ability to do business , '' says Citigroup oil analyst Mark Fletcher . \nExxon dealt with lawsuits for decades after its Valdez supertanker ran aground and spilled 11 million gallons of crude into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . \nThe spill cost Exxon $ 4.5 billion -- nearly half of which went to clean up the oil . \nThe rest was spent on payments to residents and businesses , punitive damages and settlements with the government . \nExxon never lost its perch among industry leaders , and BP wo n't either , says Citigroup 's Fletcher . \nBP remains among the top oil drillers in a world that runs on petroleum , and that may be the best way to judge the company 's lasting power . \n`` Did -LRB- Valdez -RRB- stop anyone from buying Exxon gasoline ? \nExxon 's results are better than anyone 's on a multiyear basis , '' Fletcher said . \n"}

'' \nOnly a fraction of the estimated 69 million to 131.5 million gallons of oil that have spewed into the Gulf have been recovered . \nAbout 10 million gallons of oil have been burned off , and 25 million gallons of oil-water mix have been mopped up . \nThe mainstays of the two-month-long cleanup effort are oil booms , mechanical skimmers and oil dispersants -- the same tools used to fight the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . \nImprovements to these methods have been incremental and few new ones have been developed , critics say , because oil companies have no financial incentive . \n`` The technology rapidly advanced for drilling , because there was money to be made , '' said Tim Robertson , general manager of Nuka Research & Planning , which specializes in oil spill response planning , and who worked on Seldovia , Alaska 's response during the Exxon spill . \n`` There was nothing similar that applies to oil spill recovery . '' \nFive companies -- Shell Oil , ExxonMobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron Corp. , BP America -- together spent about $ 33.8 billion to explore for new oil and gas in the past three years , according to answers the companies provided this month to a House Energy & Commerce subcommittee . \nBut their spending on research for safety , accident prevention and spill response is `` paltry '' by comparison , said Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D-Mass -RRB- , who chairs the subcommittee and introduced a bill Friday that would redirect $ 50 million per year in oil and gas royalty payments for research into new spill response technology . \nIn answers to Congress , most of the companies said they could not segregate costs for the safety - and spill-related research . \nFor example , ConocoPhillips said it spent $ 1.3 million over three years on research on safer drilling technologies , but did not specify how much it spends on accident prevention and spill-related research . \nExxonMobil said it spends $ 50 million a year on oil spill response , drilling and deepwater development research activities . \nThe company says it has maintained an internal spill research program for 40 years . \nBP said the company spent $ 29 million over three years on safer drilling operations research . \nBut spokesman Robert Wine said BP does not research oil spill cleanup technology . \nInstead , he said BP supports oil spill response organizations , such as the nonprofit Marine Spill Response Corp. . \nMSRC 's overall spending was $ 88 million in 2008 , the most recent year for which its IRS filing was available . \nBut it has no budget for research , MSRC spokeswoman Judith Roos told USA Today . \nRoos did not respond to calls and e-mails from The Associated Press . \nThe oil and gas industry now is taking steps to explore new technology . \nAnd BP has pledged $ 500 million for research efforts . \nFor its part , the federal government has spent relatively little to advance cleanup technology for spills . \nCongress appropriated only about one-sixth of the $ 30 million in research grants to universities authorized under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 after the Exxon Valdez , according to the Coastal Response Research Center . \nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- which was known as the Minerals Management Service until this month -- collects $ 13 billion a year in oil drilling royalties . \nBut the agency has been spending between $ 6 million to $ 7 million a year since 1995 on oil spill research . \nAnd the Coast Guard 's annual oil spill research budget has steadily dropped from about $ 5.6 million in 1993 to about $ 500,000 for each of the past four years . \nU.S. Rep. Brian Baird -LRB- D-Wash . -RRB- \n, who recently held hearings on oil spill cleanup technologies , said there has n't been much federal spending for cleanup because the political pressure is to drill for more oil . \n`` Our priorities have been about how to extract more oil in greater volumes and for greater profits , and there have n't been corresponding priorities on how to do so safely and how to prepare if there is an accident , '' he said in an interview . \nBP also has scrambled to try different cleanup techniques since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and creating one of the U.S. 's worst environmental disaster . \nThe company recently ordered 32 centrifuge devices made by a company co-founded by Hollywood actor Kevin Costner , who had invested about $ 24 million in the project . \nThe company says the largest of the devices can process about 210,000 gallons a day , separating gunk from water . \nDeployed on barges , the centrifuges are intended to help skimmers work more efficiently by letting them unload the oil and water mix and cleaning it at sea instead of returning to port each time the tank is full . \nAdvances in drilling technology have enabled a boom in exploration and drilling in deep waters , where lower temperatures and higher pressures require sophisticated equipment . \n`` We 've pushed the envelope more and more on offshore drilling in deep waters , '' said Nancy Kinner , co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center , a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nYet , she said , not much is known about how to collect oil from deep sea spills or how chemical dispersants used to break up oil behave at such depths . \nOil spill experts say that despite some improvements in containment booms and skimmers , they 're still limited in what they can do . \nBooms generally work best in calm weather and waves , and need lots of maintenance . \nIn Barataria Bay , absorbent boom placed around numerous marshy islands did n't stop oil slicks from reaching wetlands . \nSome sections of boom were torn apart or doubled over . \nThe stems of marsh grasses and other vegetation near the edge were stained dark brown with oil . \n`` In many case , all we have is that very basic technology and of course we use it , '' said Dennis Takahashi Kelso , vice president of the Ocean Conservancy and former Alaska Commissioner of Environmental Conservation during the Exxon Valdez spill . \n"}

Thad Allen , head of the U.S. Coast Guard , told a conference call Saturday that `` any exact estimation of what 's flowing out of those pipes down there is impossible '' because the site is about a mile underwater . \nFrustrated fishermen eager to help contain the spill had to keep their boats idle as another day of rough seas kept crews away from the slick , and President Barack Obama planned a Sunday trip to the Gulf Coast . \nDocuments also emerged showing BP PLC downplayed the possibility of a catastrophic accident at the offshore rig that exploded . \nBP operated the rig , which was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nHow far the spill will reach is unknown , but the sheen already has reached into precious shoreline habitat and remains unstopped , raising fears that the ruptured well could be pouring more oil into the gulf than estimated . \nThe Coast Guard has estimated that about 200,000 gallons of oil are spewing out each day -- which would mean 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers . \nThe environmental mess could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster , when an oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons off Alaska 's shores in 1989 . \nThe slick nearly tripled in just a day or so , growing from a spill the size of Rhode Island to something closer to the size of Puerto Rico , according to images collected from mostly European satellites and analyzed by the University of Miami . \nOn Thursday , the size of the slick was about 1,150 square miles , but by Friday 's end it was in the range of 3,850 square miles , said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing . \nThat suggests the oil has started spilling from the well more quickly , Graber said . \n`` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , '' Graber told The Associated Press on Saturday . \nLouisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , cautioned that the satellite imagery could be deceiving . \nHe said satellites ca n't measure the thickness of the sheen and makes it difficult to judge how much oil is on the water . \nAnother issue is that the oil slicks are not one giant uniform spill the size of an island . \nInstead , they are `` little globs of oil in an area of big water , '' Overton said . \nExperts also cautioned that if the spill continues growing unchecked , sea currents could suck the sheen down past the Florida Keys and then up the Eastern Seaboard . \nThe Florida Keys are home to the only living coral barrier reef in North America , and the third largest coral barrier reef in the world . \nAbout 84 percent of the nation 's coral reefs are located in Florida , where hundreds of marine species live , breed and spawn . \n`` If it gets into the Keys , that would be devastating , '' said Duke University biologist Larry Crowder . \nIan R. MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University , said his examination of Coast Guard charts and satellite images indicated that 8 million to 9 million gallons had already spilled by April 28 . \nAlabama 's governor said his state was preparing for a worst-case scenario of 150,000 barrels , or more than 6 million gallons per day . \nAt that rate the spill would amount to a Valdez-sized spill every two days , and the situation could last for months . \n`` I hope they can cap this and we talk about ` remember back when , '' ' Gov. Bob Riley said late Friday , `` but we are taking that worst-case and building barriers against it . '' \nHowever , officials with the Coast Guard brushed off such fears and said the estimates were imprecise . \nBP suggested in a 2009 exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well that an accident leading to a giant crude oil spill -- and serious damage to beaches , fish and mammals -- was unlikely , or virtually impossible . \nThe plan for the Deepwater Horizon well , filed with the federal Minerals Management Service , said repeatedly that it was `` unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities . '' \nThe company conceded a spill would impact beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , but argued that `` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' \nThe spill -- a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide -- threatens hundreds of species of wildlife , including birds , dolphins , and the fish , shrimp , oysters and crabs that make the Gulf Coast one of the nation 's most abundant sources of seafood . \nAlthough the cause of the explosion was under investigation , many of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed in the wake of the explosion claim it was caused when workers for oil services contractor Halliburton Inc. improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . \nThe Coast Guard said Saturday it had shut down two offshore platforms and evacuated one of them near the spill as a safety precaution . \nA sheen of oil from the edges of the slick was washing up at Venice , La. , and other extreme southeastern portions of Louisiana . \nAnimal rescue operations ramped up as crews found the first oiled bird offshore . \nSeveral miles out , the normally blue-green gulf waters were dotted with sticky , pea - to quarter-sized brown beads the consistency of tar . \nHigh seas were forecast through Sunday and could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds , creeks and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . \nWith the wind blowing from the south , the mess could reach the Mississippi , Alabama and Florida coasts by Monday . \nAmid increased fingerpointing , the government desperately cast about for new ideas for dealing with the growing environmental crisis . \nObama halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . \nOfficials have said stemming the flow of oil is their top priority , but the seas have been too rough and the winds too strong to burn off the oil , suck it up effectively with skimmer vessels , or hold it in check with the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast . \nThe floating barriers broke loose in the choppy water , and waves sent oily water lapping over them . \nBP also sought ideas from some of its rivals and was using at least one of them Friday -- applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface . \nThat had never before been attempted at such depths . \nBP and federal authorities said the dispersant was released overnight at the site of the leak , nearly 5,000 feet underwater , and they were evaluating the effort Saturday . \nMany of the oil-cleaning boats remained tied to the docks Saturday in Venice , partly because of the weather . \nHowever , charter boat captain Eddie Cerise said he was just awaiting instructions from BP so he could help with containment . \nHe said he attended a safety class , though he had hoped for more practical information -- like what to do if oil gets into his boat -- than what he was taught . \n`` Basically they say if you walk up on an alligator , do n't kick it , if you see something you do n't recognize , do n't do it , '' he said . \nThe weather also was keeping skimmers and other larger vessels stuck in harbor , said Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley , a spokesman for a command center in Robert , La. `` Waves are going anywhere from 5 feet to 8 feet high and getting bigger , '' he said . \n`` It definitely makes it more difficult .

'' \nIt has n't quite become a total disaster yet . \nBut it 's hard to imagine it not being devastating , said Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills . \nThe Louisiana State University professor has been testing samples of the spilled crude . \nHe compared what 's brewing to another all-too-familiar Gulf Coast threat : `` This has got all the characteristics of a Category 5 hurricane . '' \nIf conditions do n't change quickly , devastation of the highest magnitude is headed for somewhere along the coast , said Overton , who works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nMore than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the blown-out well at the site of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded April 20 and sank two days later . \nCrews are using at least six remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , but so far they 've been unsuccessful . \nMeanwhile , high winds and waves are pushing oily water over the booms meant to contain it . \nBesides BP , a slew of federal and state agencies are scrambling to minimize the onslaught of damage . \nExperts in oil spills have drills every few years to practice their response for spills of `` national significance . '' \nOne of those practice runs took place just last month in Maine . \nThe Gulf of Mexico leak is a `` combination of all the bad things happening '' and makes it far worse than any disaster imagined in the drills , said Nancy Kinner , director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire . \n`` This is relentless , '' Kinner said . \nMost Americans think of Exxon Valdez when it comes to spills . \nBut the potential and likelihood here `` is well beyond that , '' said University of Rhode Island ocean engineering professor Malcolm Spaulding . \nBecause the Deepwater Horizon well has not been capped and may flow for months more , it should be compared to a bigger more dangerous one from a well explosion in 1979 , said Tunnell . \nThat was Ixtoc 1 , off the coast of Mexico . \nIt was the worst peacetime oil spill on record . \nThe current spill `` is kind of a worst case scenario , '' Tunnell said . \nWhat makes this spill relentless and most similar to Ixtoc 1 is that it 's an active well that keeps flowing . \nThe Exxon Valdez was a tanker with a limited supply of oil . \nThe rig 40 miles from the Gulf Coast may leak for months before a relief well can be drilled to stop the flow , Kinner said . \nAnd LSU 's Overton said : `` I 'm not very optimistic that they 'll be drilling a relief well in three months . '' \nThe type of oil involved is also a major problem . \nWhile most of the oil drilled off Louisiana is a lighter crude , this is n't . \nIt 's a heavier blend because it comes from deep under the ocean surface , Overton said . \n`` If I had to pick a bad oil , I 'd put this right up there . \nThe only thing that 's not bad about this is that it does n't have a lot of sulfur in it and the high sulfur really smells bad . '' \nThe first analysis of oil spill samples showed it contains asphalt-like substances that make a major sticky mess , he said . \nThis is because the oil is older than most oil in the region and is very dense . \nThis oil also emulsifies well , Overton said . \nEmulsification is when oil and water mix thoroughly together , like a shampoo , which is mostly water , said Penn State engineering professor Anil Kulkarni . \nIt `` makes a thick gooey chocolate mousse type of mix , '' Kulkarni said . \nAnd once it becomes that kind of mix , it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil , does n't rinse off as easily , ca n't be eaten by oil-munching microbes as easily , and does n't burn as well , experts said . \nThat type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean-up weapons , Overton and others said . \nUnder better circumstances , with calmer winds and water , the oil might have a chance of rising without immediately emulsifying , but that 's not happening here , Kulkarni said . \nIt 's pretty much mixed by the time it gets to the surface . \nThe wind and waves are also pushing the oil directly toward some of the most sensitive coastal areas : the marshlands of Louisiana and surrounding states . \nAnd there are three types of beaches : sandy , rocky and marshy . \nSandy beaches , like those in Florida , are the easiest to clean , Overton said . \nBy far the hardest are marshlands and that 's where the oil is heading first . \nMarshes are so delicate that just trying to clean them causes damage , Kinner said . \nOnce the oily mess penetrates , grasses must be cut . \nBut it also penetrates the soil and that is extremely difficult to get out , she said . \nThe normal bacteria that eats oil needs oxygen to work , and in the soils of the marsh , there 's not enough oxygen for that process , she said . \nIt 's also the time of year in the Gulf of Mexico when fish spawn , plankton bloom and the delicate ecosystem is at a vulnerable stage . \nHurricane season is fast approaching in June and experts are sure the oil will still be flowing by then . \nThough it might seem counterintuitive , a big storm could help by dispersing and diluting the worst of the oil , Overton said . \n`` A hurricane is Mother Nature 's vacuum cleaner , '' Overton said . \nNormally it cleans things up . \nBut that 's not a solution with a continuing spill . \n"}

'' \nOfficials were first notified Wednesday night about the oil on Freemason Island in the Chandeleur chain , and it was confirmed Thursday , a Coast Guard official told FoxNews.com . \nWinds in the Gulf region are expected to pick up Saturday into Sunday causing the spill to be tougher to contain . \nWorkers , meanwhile , gathered Thursday to begin lowering a giant concrete-and-steel box over the blown-out oil well at the bottom of the sea in a risky and untested bid to capture most of the gushing crude and avert a wider environmental disaster . \n`` We have n't done this before . \nIt 's very complex and we ca n't guarantee it , '' BP spokesman David Nicholas warned . \nThe 100-ton containment vessel is designed to collect as much as 85 percent of the oil spewing into the Gulf and funnel it up to a tanker . \nIt could take several hours to lower it into place by crane , after which a steel pipe will be installed between the top of the box and the tanker . \nThe whole structure could be operating by Sunday . \nThe technology has been used a few times in shallow waters , but never at such extreme depths -- 5,000 feet down , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine . \nThe box -- which looks a lot like a peaked , 40-foot-high outhouse , especially on the inside , with its rough timber framing -- must be accurately positioned over the well , or it could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nOther risks include ice clogs in the pipes -- a problem that crews will try to prevent by continuously pumping in warm water and methanol -- and the danger of explosion when separating the mix of oil , gas and water that is brought to the surface . \n`` I 'm worried about every part , as you can imagine , '' said David Clarkson , BP vice president of engineering projects . \nIf the box works , a second one now being built may be used to deal with a second , smaller leak from the sea floor . \n`` Hopefully , it will work better than they expect , '' first mate Douglas Peake told The Associated Press aboard the ship that brought the box to the site . \nThe well blew open on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded 50 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 workers . \nThe well has been spewing an estimated 200,000 gallons a day in the nation 's biggest oil spill since the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . \nOil slicks stretched for miles off the Louisiana coast , where desperate efforts were under way to skim , corral and set the petroleum ablaze . \nPeople in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida watched in despair . \n"}

Demi Shaffer told The Associated Press aboard his boat just after it set off . \nThe AP is the only news organization with access to the containment effort . \nA 12-man crew aboard a supply boat was carrying the precious cargo . \nThe 280-foot Joe Griffin , owned by Edison Chouest Offshore , also was involved in helping fight the fire that resulted from the oil rig explosion . \nThe vessel is named for a boat captain who worked with company founder Edison Chouest , when Chouest was still in the shrimping business . \nThe operator of the oil rig , BP PLC , has tried several high-tech undersea tactics to cap the leak . \nThe containment dome endeavor is unprecedented and engineers are fully aware of the risks . \nFirst , crews need to properly position the four-story structure above the well as it sinks deep into the mud at the bottom of the Gulf with the help of a remote-controlled robotic submarine . \nA steel pipe will be attached to a tanker at the surface and connected to the top of the dome to move the oil . \n`` It 's very dark down there ... and we will have lights on the -LRB- submersibles -RRB- , and we know exactly where to put this and guide it into place , '' said David Clarkson , BP 's vice president for project execution . \nThat process presents several challenges because of the frigid water temperature -- about 42 degrees Fahrenheit -- and exceptionally high pressure at those depths . \nThose conditions could cause the pipe to clog with what are known in the drilling industry as `` ice plugs . '' \nTo combat that problem , crews plan to continuously pump warm water and methanol down the pipe to dissolve the clogging . \nThey are also worried about volatile cocktail of oil , gas and water when it arrives on the ship above . \nEngineers believe the liquids can be safely separated without an explosion . \nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry tried to moderate expectations that the containment box would be a silver bullet . \n`` I know we are all hoping that this containment system will work , but I want to remind everybody that this containment system is a first of its kind deployed in 5,000 feet of water , '' Landry said . \nAsked to handicap the odds of success , Bob Fryer , a senior executive vice president for BP 's Deep Water Angola , offered up this assessment : `` This has never been done before . \nTypically you would put odds on something that has been done before . '' \nFryer also said BP is exploring a technique in which crews would reconfigure the well that would allow them to plug the leak , but that effort is a couple weeks off . \nThe containment effort comes as dozens of boats were deployed across the Gulf to fight back the slick at the surface , including setting fires to burn off oil and laying booms to soak up the crude and block it from reaching the coast . \nWhile people anxiously wait for the mess to wash up along the coast , globules of oil are already falling to the bottom of the sea , where they threaten virtually every link in the ocean food chain , from plankton to fish that are on dinner tables everywhere . \nHail-size gobs of oil with the consistency of tar or asphalt will roll around the bottom , while other bits will get trapped hundreds of feet below the surface and move with the current , said Robert S. Carney , a Louisiana State University oceanographer . \n`` The threat to the deep-sea habitat is already a done deal -- it is happening now , '' said Paul Montagna , a marine scientist at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi . \nScientists say bacteria , plankton and other tiny , bottom-feeding creatures will consume oil , and will then be eaten by small fish , crabs and shrimp . \nThey , in turn , will be eaten by bigger fish , such as red snapper , and marine mammals like dolphins . \nThe petroleum substances that concentrate in the sea creatures could kill them or render them unsafe for eating , scientists say . \n`` If the oil settles on the bottom , it will kill the smaller organisms like the copepods and small worms , '' Montagna said . \n`` When we lose the forage , then you have an impact on the larger fish . '' \nMaking matters worse for the deep sea is the leaking well 's location : It is near the continental shelf of the Gulf where a string of coral reefs flourishes . \nCoral is a living creature that excretes a hard calcium carbonate exoskeleton , and oil globs can kill it . \nScientists are watching carefully to see whether the slick will hitch a ride to the East Coast by way of a powerful eddy known as the `` loop current , '' which could send the spill around Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean . \nIf that happens , the oil could foul beaches and kill marine life on the East Coast . \nThe cause of the rig explosion is still not known , but investigators from multiple federal agencies are looking into the matter . \nThe rig owner , Transocean Ltd. , said in a filing with regulators Wednesday that it has received a request from the Justice Department to preserve information about the blast . \n"}
{"id": "1942", "time": "2010-06-21", "text": "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA -LRB- AP -RRB- -- When an Associated Press reporter went scuba diving in the oil-streaked Gulf of Mexico this month , people commenting on websites worried about his health . \nBut at the same time , the oil sure did n't bother some beachgoers in Alabama . \n`` I was in the water two hours yesterday , '' said Robert Theil , a French visitor to Orange Beach , as his sister acted as translator . \n`` I 'm not worried . \nIt would take a lot before it could hurt you . '' \nHealth officials say there seems to be little reason to worry at this point . \nBut some note that health effects months or years from now remain a question mark , particularly for the workers who are in the thick of it , cleaning up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf . \nPublic health officials and scientists will take up the topic at a two-day meeting beginning Tuesday in New Orleans , organized by the Institute of Medicine at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services . \nThe group will also talk about how best to watch for any potential problems . \nHHS has already set aside $ 10 million to study cleanup workers and Gulf residents over time . \nIn the meantime , some questions and answers : Q : Has anyone gotten sick from the oil spilled in the Gulf ? \nA : Yes , there have been reports of illnesses , but relatively few among people not involved in the spill cleanup . \nMost of the reported illnesses were related to odors or fumes . \nAlmost all were mild and temporary , and many were in early May , within the first few weeks of the April 20 explosion . \nThe reports are based on a doctor 's assessment , not on lab testing . \nAll but 35 of the 109 spill-related illnesses in Louisiana have been workers . \nAlabama has 29 reports of illnesses that might be related to the spill , and Florida and Mississippi have had none . \nQ : So , what about the air ? \nIt safe to breathe ? \nA : For those along the coast , for the most part , yes . \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has been monitoring the air since shortly after the spill ; readings posted Friday show mostly good air quality . \nSome earlier results have found low levels of pollutants that can cause temporary problems like headaches , nausea or irritation of the eyes , nose and throat . \nThe pollutants have periodically pushed an industrial smell onshore in some place -- one beachgoer compared it to a machine shop . \nBut an oily odor does not necessarily mean it 's harmful , said LuAnn White , director of Tulane University 's Center for Applied Environmental Public Health . \nOfficials continue to test . \n`` We are still concerned , '' said John Howard , director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health . \nAnd out on the water , tests have detected vapors from benzene , one of the chemicals in the oil that scientists say can cause cancer . \nThe good news is that benzene can evaporate or burn off quickly , so the concentrations are much lower toward land . \nQ : What about all those tar balls and splotches of oil on some beaches ? \nA : It 's best to avoid them . \nOil on bare skin should be washed off as soon as possible , health officials say . \nSoap and water , baby oil or petroleum jelly are the best way to remove it . \nLonger contact can cause skin to redden , swell and burn . \nThe problem can get worse if the skin is exposed to the sun . \nWhite compared it to spilling motor oil on your hands . \n`` Are you going to get sick ? \nBut do you want to do it ? \nI do n't think so , '' she said . \nBut another expert cautioned that some chemicals in the oil and dispersants used in the cleanup can be easily absorbed through the skin . \n`` People are n't paying close attention like they should , '' said Robert Herrick , an industrial hygiene expert at the Harvard School of Public Health . \nQ : Can I swim in it ? \nA : Better not . \nYou could get oil on your skin , and there 's the added possibility of accidentally swallowing whatever 's in the water . \nLouisiana beaches have been closed in Grande Isle and Fourchon , but because of cleanup efforts , not for health reasons . \nAlabama late last week lifted swimming advisories for beaches in Mobile County , but they remain in place for Baldwin County , near Florida . \nQ : Are people along the Gulf coast worried they 'll get sick ? \nA : Some are . \nThere apparently have n't been any surveys asking Gulf residents if they 're concerned about their health . \nBut calls to poison control centers have been lower than expected , and officials in some Gulf states say they 've heard more angst over the impacts on the environment and local business than about health . \n`` I look at it this way : It 's from the Earth . \nIf you drank it in your drinking water every day it would hurt you . \nBut spend a week in the water on vacation and it 's not going to , '' said Elaine Fox , who visited Orange Beach , Ala. , with a group from Family Church in West Monroe , La. . \nShe spent time photographing her pregnant daughter-in-law Christi Fox , 25 , who lounged in the surf draped in a white cloth covering a white bikini . \nA few tar balls stuck to her bathing suit as she walked back to their condominium . \nQ : How about the seafood ? \nIs it safe to eat ? \nA : The president thinks so . \nBarack Obama ate Gulf seafood during his last visit to Mississippi . \nHe declared that seafood from the region is safe , and also announced stepped-up inspections . \nParts of the Gulf with oil have been closed for fishing . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Food and Drug Administration are sampling fish from the Gulf and are to begin checking fish that come in to docks . \nHowever , inspectors have yet to make an appearance at docksides , and some restaurants have been putting up signs saying they do not sell Gulf seafood . \nSome critics say testing needs to improve . \nQ : Will there be long-term health effects ? \nA : They do n't know . \nSome health officials say they do n't think long-term illnesses are likely . \nBut they 've never seen pollution of this scale , and there are just too many unknowns to say for sure . \n`` It 's theoretically possible , but at this point of time not something people are predicting will happen , '' said Dr. Thomas Miller , an assistant state health officer with Alabama 's health department . \nSome chemicals in the oil are associated with a cancer risk . \nBut it can take decades for an environmental trigger to result in cancer . \nAnd when cancers do occur , it 's difficult to sort out the real cause -- for example , whether oil fumes inhaled over two months played a greater role than cigarette smoke inhaled in bars over the course of a lifetime . \n"}

'' \nOn top of that , BBC is airing a documentary Monday night featuring allegations by one Deepwater Horizon rig worker who said he spotted a leak in the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- two weeks prior to the explosion . \nTyrone Benton , a robot operator , said one of the robot 's cameras spotted a leak on a control pod of the BOP , which is an emergency shutoff valve fixed to the wellhead on the seafloor . \nBenton told BBC that supervisors shut down the one BOP and turned on another so that work would n't stop . \n`` They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production , '' Benton said . \n`` We are aware of the allegation , '' Williams said of Benton 's claims , adding that the details that led to the explosions and fire are still under investigation and BP has not spoken with every witness yet . \n`` The -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- was part of the Deepwater Horizon equipment which was owned and operated by Transocean . \nTransocean was responsible for both the operation and maintenance of the BOP on the drilling rig , '' she added . \nFox News ' Greg Palkot and The Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "915", "time": "2010-06-21", "text": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Overwhelmed and saddened by the gargantuan size of the Gulf oil spill ? \nA little mathematical context to the spill size can put the environmental catastrophe in perspective . \nViewing it through some lenses , it is n't that huge . \nThe Mississippi River pours as much water into the Gulf of Mexico in 38 seconds as the BP oil leak has done in two months . \nOn a more human scale , the spill seems more daunting . \nTake the average-sized living room . \nThe amount of oil spilled would fill 9,200 of them . \nSince the BP oil rig exploded on April 20 , about 126.3 million gallons of oil has gushed into the Gulf . \nThat calculation is based on the higher end of the government 's range of barrels leaked per day and the oil company BP 's calculations for the amount of oil siphoned off as of Monday morning . \nUsing the more optimistic end of calculations , the total spill figure is just shy of 68 million gallons . \nFor this by-the-numbers exercise , The Associated Press is using the higher figure . \nFor every gallon of oil that BP 's well has gushed into the Gulf of Mexico , there is more than 5 billion gallons of water already in it . \nAnd the mighty Mississippi adds another billion gallons every five minutes or so , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . \nSo BP chief executive officer Tony Hayward was factually correct last month when he said the spill was `` relatively tiny '' compared to what he mischaracterized as a `` very big ocean . '' \nBut another big number that Hayward provided on Thursday also offers some troubling news . \nHe said the reservoir of oil under the sea that is the source for the leak is believed to hold about 2.1 billion gallons of oil . \nThat leaves about 2 billion gallons left to spew . \nSo there are about 16 gallons of oil underneath the sea floor yet to gush for every gallon that has already fouled the Gulf . \nIf the problem were never fixed , that would mean another two years of oil spilling based on the current flow rate . \nMore not-so-dreadful context : The amount of oil spilled so far could only fill the cavernous New Orleans Superdome about one-seventh of the way up . \nOn the other hand , it could fill 15 Washington Monuments and two-thirds of the way up a 16th . \nIf the oil were poured on a football field -- complete with endzones -- it would measure nearly 100 yards high . \nIf you put the oil in gallon milk jugs and lined them up , they would stretch about 11,000 miles . \nThat 's a roundtrip from the Gulf to London , BP 's headquarters , and a side trip from New Orleans to Washington for Hayward to testify . \nBP has spent more than $ 54.8 million lobbying federal officials in Washington since 2000 ; that 's about 43 cents for every gallon of oil it has spilled . \nSince 2000 , the oil and gas industry -- along with their employees -- has contributed $ 154.2 million to candidates for federal office . \nThat 's $ 1.22 for each gallon of oil spilled . \nOf that money , 78 percent went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats . \nTake the 126.3 million gallons of oil spilled in the Gulf and convert it to gasoline , which is what Americans mostly use it for . \nThat produces 58.6 million gallons of gas -- the amount American drivers burn every three hours and 43 minutes . \nIt 's enough to fill up the gas tanks in nearly 3.7 million cars -- more than those in Louisiana and Mississippi combined . \nAt $ 2.75 a gallon for gas -- the national average -- that 's more than $ 161 million worth spilled into the Gulf . \nAssociated Press Writer Sharon Theimer in Washington contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "572", "time": "2010-06-28", "text": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The BP oil spill has hammered the fishing and tourism industries along the Gulf of Mexico . \nBut it appears the economic damage to the rest of the nation will be limited . \nAnalysts say the spill will reduce economic growth by only about one-half of 1 percentage point this quarter , and even less during the second half of the year . \nEven for an economy as large as the United States ' -- $ 14.6 trillion -- a $ 73 billion cut is barely a nick . \n-- Spending on tourism is moving elsewhere . \nBeachgoers who might have headed for Pensacola , Fla. , for example , are looking toward Atlantic coast sites such as Myrtle Beach , S.C. Gulf hotel rooms going unused by tourists are being booked by cleanup crews . \n-- Damage to Gulf fishermen may last , but , as with tourism , the Gulf 's commercial fishing makes up only a tiny fraction of the U.S. economy . \nAnd most fish eaten in the United States is imported , says Michael Feroli , an economist at JPMorgan Chase . \n-- The Gulf energy industry , which makes up about 10 percent of the regional economy , is not vital to the nation 's . \nThe six-month ban on deepwater drilling that a judge blocked Tuesday would only deduct about 0.03 percent from the U.S. economy . \n-- If deepwater drilling becomes too much of a financial burden and oil companies move their rigs abroad , coastal communities would be hurt in Louisiana and Texas would be hurt . \nBut the national impact would be slight because of how small a portion of U.S. oil consumption the Gulf supplies , says Ed Friedman , economist at Moody 's Analytics -- less than 10 percent . \nThe local communities will suffer damage to their economies and environments for years , even if the spill is capped later this summer . \nWells Fargo economist Mark Vitner estimates that up to 250,000 Gulf jobs in fishing , tourism and energy will be lost in the second half of the year . \nThe new jobs in cleanup wo n't make up for what 's been lost , and will probably pay less , Vitner and others say . \nConsumers in the region will spend less as a result . \nThat will lower the U.S. economy 's growth rate in the July-to-September quarter by a slight 0.2 percentage point , Vitner said . \nHe envisions little or no effect on growth in the fourth quarter of the year , assuming the leak is plugged by then . \nSome cleanup jobs are paying $ 15 to $ 18 an hour . \nBy contrast , the thousands of rig workers idled by the deepwater drilling moratorium earn up to $ 1,800 a week -- roughly $ 45 an hour , trade groups estimate . \nThat amounts to a collective loss of tens of millions of dollars in pay . \nFishermen earn less -- on average about $ 13 an hour , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says . \nBut the destruction of fishing industry jobs is still taking a heavy toll . \nTake Rocky Ditcharo , a dock owner in Plaquemines Parish , La. , whose family has been in the shrimping business for four generations . \nShrimpers sidelined by the spill are n't using his dock . \nNeither are boats involved in containing the spill by laying booms . \nDitcharo , 44 , survived Katrina and other hurricanes . \nBut he fears this may be the end of his business . \n`` I 'm in dire straits , '' he says . \nBP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for oil-spill victims . \nIn addition , it will pay $ 100 million into another fund to help oil workers sidelined by the moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nAnd President Barack Obama has pledged additional resources to the coastal states , though he has n't provided details . \nYet despite the promises by BP and the government to restore the region , economists say they fear some affected people and businesses will still be awaiting help years from now . \nVitner points to Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans , where many buildings and homes await restoration . \nBusinesses are still shuttered . \nVitner and others fear a similar scenario this time : A local economy remains devastated even as the national economy moves ahead . \n`` This particular situation is much more than can be measured by GDP , '' says Lynn Reaser , president of the National Association for Business Economics . \n`` It is a real tragedy for people 's livelihoods and culture in the region .

{"id": "441", "time": "2010-05-30", "text": "May 29 : This image made from video released by British Petroleum -LRB- BP PLC -RRB- shows the gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP In what is measuring up to be the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history , the government is nearly helpless to stop the oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 . \nThe White House said Sunday that it expects the spill to grow by 20 percent after BP gets started with its latest effort to contain the spill , beginning Monday or Tuesday . \nThe White House also said it is tripling its environmental cleanup crew . \nBut the additional spillage is opposite what BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said on `` Fox News Sunday '' -- that the decision to cut open the pipes in order to put a cap on the well will likely not add to the amount of oil flowing into the water . \n`` What we need is a clean cut across the top of that riser package at the bottom of the sea . \nThe amount of oil will not change . \nThe oil was coming out anyway from just above it at a broken area of the pipe at the end of the pipe . \nSo that is not going to change the flow , '' he said . \nPresident Obama 's top environmental adviser Carol Browner said Sunday the government is responding with what she called the largest environmental mobilization effort ever , but it looks like it could be up to BP to dig a new well before the gushing spill stops pouring into the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` There 's not just one being dug , there are two . \nBecause we insisted -- the government insisted that there be a second one in case something went wrong with the first one , '' Browner said on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' \nThat 's after BP 's `` top kill '' effort to plug the hole with hundreds of thousands of pounds of mud failed . \nBP is looking at the next alternative -- trying to grab the oil that 's spilling into the water and move it onto a vessel that will pull the oil onshore . \n`` Obviously that 's not the preferred scenario . \nWe always knew that the relief well was the permanent way to close this , to get it killed so there was n't oil coming up while the relief well was being drilled was the second option . \nNow we move to the third option which is to contain it , '' Browner said . \nThe federal government has placed 150 scientists on the case , and concerns have been raised to BP about putting additional pressure on the leaking well that could make the spill worse . \nThe government estimates that 12,000-19 ,000 barrels of oil are being released daily from 5,000 feet below the sea . \nEstimates are at about 18 million to 40 million gallons have been dumped into the Gulf since the explosion . \nDudley said after the last containment dome failed because ice crystals formed in the pipe , scientists learned to pump warm sea water down the column of the pipe to prevent the same kind of problems while trying to get the oil up into the vessel . \nDudley said he was hopeful the odds of success are greater than the 60 to 70 percent odds put on the top kill method . \n`` We feel like the percentages are better that we 'll be able to contain the oil . \nThe question is how much of the oil we 'll be able to contain , and the objective is to try to collect the majority of it through this vessel , '' he said . \nRep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n, chairman of the House energy committee investigating the oil spill , told CBS he has no faith in BP to get the gusher contained . \n`` I have no confidence whatsoever in BP . \nI think that they do not know what they are doing . \nThey started off talking about golf balls going in as a junk shot . \nPeople thought they would be dependent on MIT or Cal Tech instead of the PGA and golf balls . \nThat was in the first couple of weeks . \nSo I do n't think that people should really believe what BP is saying in terms of the likelihood of anything that they 're doing is going to turn out as they 're predicting , '' he said . \nBrowner said whatever the worst-case scenario , if there is any good news , it is that the environmental response is up and running , and systems have been put in place `` to manage and decrease the amount of oil that comes onshore . '' \nAmong those , Browner said 80 burns have been conducted to get the oil off the top of the water , but those are limited by weather . \nIn addition , booms have been set in place to capture the oil slicks before they come ashore . \nLastly , 1,400 vessels are using skimmers to try to get the oil out of the water . \n`` We are using skimmers that skim up the oil sheen , they bring up water , I think they over 11 billion barrels of oil and water that have been skimmed up , '' Browner said . \nBut Louisiana Sen. David Vitter and other lawmakers and state officials have complained that not enough booms have been put up to shield Louisiana 's shores , where 150 miles of coastline are already affected . \nHe said he is very dissatisfied with the administration 's response . \n`` The state and locals came up with a plan on emergency dredging barrier islands well over two weeks ago . \nFor over two weeks , the corps and other federal agencies dragged their feet . \n9:16:49 Then , they approved moving forward with 2 percent of that plan , '' he told CNN . \nVitter said the disaster has not turned him against offshore drilling -- that would be like saying he 's opposed to air travel after a plane crash . \nMore importantly , Vitter said , the key is to finding out what went wrong and making sure it does n't happen again . \nTo that extent the Republican senator is on the same page as the administration , though Vitter and Browner part ways on stopping deep water drilling until that investigation is complete , a situation Browner acknowledged only compounds economic troubles for the region and the country . \n`` In the Arctic they 've been shut down . \nIn the Gulf of Mexico they 've been shut down , including 33 rigs that were out there drilling right now , which we understand is going to be hard on those people , '' she said . \n`` We have to learn from this accident . \nIn the interim we have shut down all deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico until we have an answer to , one , how can you make sure that these operations are safe , that there are redundancies in place ? \n... Secondly , what happens when those redundancies do n't work ? '' \nIn the meantime , the nation 's top environmental advocate acknowledged that the devastation is beyond any scope the U.S. has ever seen . \n`` More oil is leaking into the Gulf of Mexico than as any other time in our history . \nIt means there 's more and more -- more oil than the Exxon Valdez , '' she said . \nFox News ' Malini Wilkes contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "3", "time": "2010-06-17", "text": "BP 's announcement on Wednesday that it will pay $ 20 billion into an escrow account may sound like a win for the USA and victims of the Gulf oil spill . \nIn fact , it could be a powerful new tool for the White House 's political machine , and is the latest manifestation of the Obama administration 's willingness to work outside the law . \nIt also lays bare Big Oil 's willingness to get cozy with the left . \nThere is no legal basis for the Obama administration to induce BP to pay $ 20 billion into a kitty to be controlled by one of its political appointees . \nWhile this may play well in populist circles , create the appearance of action , and was apparently easy to foist onto BP 's hapless management , it weakens the rule of law by essentially circumventing the law . \nThere is already a well-established legal process for remedying the economic cost of someone else 's negligence . \nEvery day , thousands of Americans sue other individuals or companies , either by themselves or via class actions that combine their efforts . \nThe design and rules of these legal processes are laid out in laws crafted by Congress and state legislatures . \nBP 's $ 20 billion was extracted outside of this legal framework for reasons that have not been explained . \nThere is a high risk that this fund will be doled out based on political , not legal criteria . \nRather than judges and juries making decisions , an economic commissar will . \nThis fits the emerging pattern of lawlessness in Mr. Obama 's Washington . \nBefore this , Exhibit A was the health care bill . \nThe procedure by which it was passed , and its more novel provisions -LRB- e.g. , compulsory insurance -RRB- , were conjured with general disregard of the Constitution and legal and legislative norms . \nMore recently , Mr. Obama 's technology guru at the White House unethically used the power of his office to browbeat private businesses into offering him discounts . \nAnd the man who will administer the new $ 20 billion fund , Kenneth Feinberg , is the government 's so-called `` Pay Czar , '' and has used questionable government power to dictate compensation levels for financial industry employees . \nLost in this mess is any reference to limits on government set forth in the Constitution or law . \nFor its part , BP has done a great disservice to its shareholders . \nDespite its charitable pay-in to a Democratically-controlled kitty , the company can still be sued separately by anyone with a grievance . \nCongress can theoretically change this so that compensation is managed through the fund . \nBut BP CEO Tony Hayward probably should have sought that before signing over his shareholders ' money . \nAt present , the $ 20 billion has won BP no legal protection and amounts only to history 's most expensive P.R. move . \nAs time goes by , Mr. Hayward comes increasingly to resemble the character James Taggart in the Ayn Rand novel `` Atlas Shrugged . '' \nBoth men came to run mighty businesses created by more talented managers . \nBoth were beguiled by cunning creatures of government who sought to bring wealth and wealth-creators under the heel of the state . \nJames Taggart sought the love of the aptly named lobbyist-turned-economic-dictator `` Wesley Mouch . '' \nHayward and his contemporaries throughout Big Oil crave a similar acceptance from those who plot their destruction , and on their way to that end , the erosion of the rule of law . \nIndeed , it is a canard of the left that Big Oil is a bulwark of capitalism and private property rights that hinders the march of progressivism . \nBP has sought cozy relations with liberal environmental groups . \nIt has donated $ 10 million to the Nature Conservancy and $ 2 million to Conservation International . \nIt has a partnership related to wind power with groups like the Sierra Club , the Natural Resources Defense Council , and the Union of Concerned Scientists . \nOther Big Oil giants play a similar game . \nIn 2008-09 , Chevron peppered Washington , D.C. subway stations with sanctimonious ads showing people vowing to lead green lifestyles and use less of Chevron 's own product . \nLast year , Chevron 's CEO agreed in a debate with the Sierra Club 's executive director that there ought to be a new energy tax . \nCurrently , Chevron 's website on corporate social responsibility has a link to the left wing Human Rights Campaign , whose notable contribution to the 2004 presidential race was printing stickers declaring `` George W. Bush : ` You 're Fired . '' ' \nAll of this brings to mind Winston Churchill 's definition of an appeaser as `` one who feeds the crocodile hoping it will eat him last . '' \nSo it is with those currently running Big Oil . \nUnfortunately , they are not only victimizing their shareholders , but everyone else in the radical environmentalists ' cross hairs , including Americans who do things like drive cars and heat their homes in winter . \nTwo solutions are wanting . \nFirst , voters could use elections this November to elect a conservative Congress that starts insisting Mr. Obama respect the rule of law and the limits of constitutional government . \nSecond , shareholders of oil companies could insist on a management able to focus more on long-term shareholder value -- and political strategies smarter than attempting to appease enemies committed to their demise . \nOtherwise , shareholders might suddenly find that those who are supposed to represent their interests have instead given $ 20 billion away to liberal politicians for nothing in return . \nChristian Whiton served in the administration of President George W.

'' \nShe was grabbed by Capitol police and taken from the room . \nMoments later , Hayward began his remarks , saying that the Gulf oil spill `` never should have happened '' and that he regretted the impact the spill has had on the environment and the people of the Gulf Coast . \nBefore Hayward 's testimony , lawmakers accused him of being oblivious to the risks of the company 's deep-water operations . \nSome of the sharpest criticism came from Rep. Bart Stupak , D-Mich . \n`` We are not small people . \nBut we wish to get our lives back , '' he told Hayward . \n`` I 'm sure you 'll get your life back , and with a golden parachute to England . '' \nIt was a reference to Hayward 's much-criticized earlier remark that some day he hoped to get `` my life back '' and to comments on the White House driveway on Wednesday by BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg that `` we care about the small people '' of the Gulf Coast . \nHayward sipped a beverage and jotted notes as one lawmaker after another scorched him . \nEarly on , attention shifted away from Hayward as lawmakers traded barbs over the agreement President Obama announced on Wednesday with BP for the establishment of a $ 20 billion relief fund . \nRep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , accused the White House of a `` $ 20 billion shakedown '' of BP by requiring the company to establish the huge fund to compensate those hurt by the oil spill . \n`` I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House '' on Wednesday , Barton said . \nBut Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n, fired back that the fund is `` not a shakedown . '' \n`` Rather , it was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country -- right now , the residents of the Gulf , '' he said . \n`` It 's BP 's spill , but it 's America 's ocean and it 's American citizens who are the ones being harmed . '' \nHayward expects to tell Congress he is `` personally devastated '' by the Gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger Americans feel toward him and his company . \nThe explosion and sinking of the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig `` never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , '' he said in testimony to be delivered to a House panel Thursday . \n`` My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . '' ' \n`` To be sure , neither I nor the company is perfect , '' Hayward said . \n`` But we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities . '' \nHe said the British-based company has spent nearly $ 1.5 billion since the April 20 explosion , and wo n't stop until the job is done . \nHayward also called the explosion `` a complex accident , caused by an unprecedented combination of failures . '' \nA group of protesters milled in the hallway outside the hearing room , including Diane Wilson , 61 , a fourth-generation fisher from Seadrift , Texas , near the Gulf Coast . \nWilson , appearing with a black-stained hand , said she wanted to send a message : `` Hayward should go to jail . '' \nShe was joined by Ann Wright , 63 , of Honolulu , Hawaii , who wore a BP hardhat , overalls and sunglasses adorned with dollar signs . \n`` BP does n't really care about this , '' she said , pulling out an oil-stained rubber ducky . \nThursday was Hayward 's inaugural appearance since the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \nHayward has said he 's got thick enough skin to handle the verbal assaults . \n`` I 'm so far unscathed , '' he told analysts in a recent conference call , referring to the general criticism he 's received . \n`` No one has actually physically harmed me . \nThey 've thrown some words at me . \nBut I 'm a Brit , so sticks and stones can hurt your bones but words never break them , or whatever the expression is . '' \nThe BP CEO follows a long list of corporate faces used as congressional punching bags . \nJust this year , executives from Goldman Sachs spent nine hours trying to fend off accusations from senators that they bilked investors , and Toyota President Akio Toyoda personally and repeatedly apologized for deadly defects in his company 's cars , only to have angry lawmakers forcefully respond that was hardly sufficient . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}

{"id": "1499", "time": "2010-06-17", "text": "Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas listens to opening statements from members of Congress , on Capitol Hill in Washington , Thursday , June 17 , 2010 , prior to BP CEO Tony Hayward testifying before an Energy and Environment subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing on the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill . \n-LRB- AP -RRB- Republicans have strongly rebuked one of their own , Texas Rep. Joe Barton , for accusing the White House of engaging in what he called a `` $ 20 billion shakedown '' of BP , with one lawmaker calling on Barton to resign his leadership position on a powerful committee . \nBarton apologized for his comment under pressure from the House Republican leaders who threatened to strip him of his post as the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee . \nHouse Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor , R-Va . \n, `` are in agreement that he was within a centimeter of losing his position , '' a senior GOP aide told Fox News . \n`` He could apologize immediately or lose his position . '' \nBarton had complained at a hearing earlier Thursday that the Obama administration was forcing BP to set up a $ 20 billion `` slush fund '' for oil spill victims . \nBarton said he was ashamed of the White House 's actions -- and he apologized to BP . \nThe comments got no backing from his fellow Republicans . \n`` Congressman Barton 's statements this morning were wrong , '' Boehner , Cantor and Rep. Mike Pence , R-Ind . \n, said in a written statement . \n`` BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion dollars for that purpose . '' \nRep. Jeff Miller , R-Fla . \n, said he was `` shocked '' by Barton 's `` reprehensible comments that the government should apologize for the ` shakedown ' of BP . '' \n`` I condemn Mr. Barton 's statement , '' Miller said in a written statement . \n`` Mr. Barton 's remarks are out of touch with this tragedy and I feel his comments call into question his judgment and ability to serve in a leadership position on the Energy and Commerce Committee . \nHe should step down as ranking member of the committee . '' \nThe unusual intraparty rebuke came after Barton issued an apology of sorts about his apology to BP -- then retracted that apology . \n`` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' ... and I retract my apology to BP , '' he said , adding that his remarks had been `` misconstrued . '' \n`` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , '' he said . \nOn Wednesday , President Obama announced that BP had agreed to set up a $ 20 billion relief fund that will be led by the administration 's `` pay czar , '' Kenneth Feinberg , who oversaw the $ 7 billion government fund for families of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . \nThe use of the BP escrow fund is intended to avoid a repeat of the painful aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska , when the fight over money dragged out in courts for roughly two decades . \nDemocrats quickly pounced on Barton 's initial apology to BP . \nVice President Biden called those remarks `` outrageous '' and the White House issued a statement calling on members of both parties to `` repudiate his comments . '' \n`` What is shameful is that Joe Barton seems to have more concern for big corporations that caused this disaster than the fishermen , small business owners and communities whose lives have been devastated by the destruction , '' the White House said in a written statement . \n`` Congressman Barton may think that a fund to compensate these Americans is a ` tragedy , ' but most Americans know that the real tragedy is what the men and women of the Gulf Coast are going through right now . '' \nWhen pressed at the hearing by a Democratic lawmaker on whether he thought the fund was a shakedown , Hayward said he did n't think it was a `` slush fund . '' \nBiden called Barton 's comments `` incredibly insensitive '' and `` out of touch . '' \nThe fund is intended `` to protect people who are drowning , '' Biden said at the daily White House briefing Thursday . \n`` What is wrong with that ? \nHow is that a shakedown ? \nI do n't know . \nI find it pretty astounding . '' \nCampaign for Fair Elections , a nonpartisan campaign reform advocacy group , blasted Barton for his comments , noting that he has received $ 27,000 from BP in campaign contributions since 1989 and $ 1.4 million from the oil & gas industry . \n`` It 's amazing that Rep. Barton would stand up for a multinational corporation that has wrecked the livelihoods of so many people along the Gulf Coast , '' said David Donnelly , campaign manager for the group . \n`` Comments like this make all Americans question whether Congress represents them or the special interests funding their campaign . '' \nDonnelly called on Barton to contribute BP 's campaign donations to the Gulf recovery effort . \nRep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . \n, defended the $ 20 billion fund during Thursday 's hearing , saying the fund `` is not a shakedown . \n`` Rather , it was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country -- right now , the residents of the Gulf , '' he said . \n`` It 's BP 's spill , but it 's America 's ocean and it 's American citizens who are the ones being harmed .

{"id": "816", "time": "2010-06-17", "text": "`` Chairman Stupak , Ranking Member Burgess , members of the Subcommittee . \nI am Tony Hayward , Chief Executive of BP plc. . \nThe explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened ? \nand I am deeply sorry that they did . \nNone of us yet knows why it happened . \nBut whatever the cause , we at BP will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again . \nSince April 20 , I have spent a great deal of my time in the Gulf Coast region and in the incident command center in Houston , and let there be no mistake ? \nI understand how serious this situation is . \nThis is a tragedy : people lost their lives ; others were injured ; and the Gulf Coast environment and communities are suffering . \nThis is unacceptable , I understand that , and let me be very clear : I fully grasp the terrible reality of the situation . \nWhen I learned that eleven men had lost their lives in the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon , I was personally devastated . \nThree weeks ago , I attended a memorial service for those men , and it was a shattering moment . \nI want to offer my sincere condolences to their friends and families -- I can only imagine their sorrow . \nMy sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . \nI want to speak directly to the people who live and work in the Gulf region : I know that this incident has profoundly impacted lives and caused turmoil , and I deeply regret that . \nIndeed , this is personal for us at BP . \nMany of our 23,000 U.S. employees live and work in the Gulf Coast region . \nFor decades , the people of the Gulf Coast states have extended their hospitality to us and to the companies like Arco and Amoco that are now part of BP . \nWe have always strived to be a good neighbor . \nWe have worked to hire employees and contractors , and to buy many of our supplies , locally . \nThe data described throughout this testimony is accurate to the best of my knowledge as of 7am , June 16 , 2010 , when this testimony was prepared . \nThe information that we have continues to develop as our response to this incident continues . \nI want to acknowledge the questions that you and the public are rightly asking . \nHow could this happen ? \nHow damaging is the spill to the environment ? \nWhy is it taking so long to stop the flow of oil and gas into the Gulf ? \nAnd questions are being asked about energy policy more broadly : Can we as a society explore for oil and gas in safer and more reliable ways ? \nWhat is the appropriate regulatory framework for the industry ? \nWe do n't yet have answers to all these important questions . \nBut I hear the concerns , fears , frustrations -- and anger -- being voiced across the country . \nI understand it , and I know that these sentiments will continue until the leak is stopped , and until we prove through our actions that we will do the right thing . \nOur actions will mean more than words , and we know that , in the end , we will be judged by the quality of our response . \nUntil this happens , no words will be satisfying . \nNonetheless , I am here today because I have a responsibility to the American people to do my best to explain what BP has done , is doing , and will do in the future to respond to this terrible incident . \nAnd while we ca n't undo these tragic events , I give you my word that we will do the right thing . \nWe will not rest until the well is under control , and we will meet all our obligations to clean up the spill and address its environmental and economic impacts . \nFrom the moment I learned of the explosion and fire , I committed the global resources of BP to the response efforts . \nTo be sure , neither I nor the company is perfect . \nBut we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities . \nWe are a strong company , and nothing is being spared . \nWe are going to do everything in our power to address fully the economic and environmental consequences of this spill and to ensure that we use the lessons learned from this incident to make energy exploration and production safer and more reliable for everyone . \nWe have been committed to responding to these tragic events and coordinating with the federal government from the beginning . \nOn April 21 , the Administration began holding meetings and regular calls with me and other members of BP 's leadership to discuss BP 's response effort , as well as federal oversight and support . \nEven before the Deepwater Horizon sank on the morning of April 22 , a Unified Command structure was established , as provided by federal regulations . \nCurrently led by the National Incident Commander , Admiral Thad Allen , the Unified Command provides a structure for BP 's work with the Coast Guard , the Minerals Management Service and Transocean , among others . \nWe are grateful for the leadership of President Obama , members of his cabinet , the state governors and local officials . \nAs the scope of the unfolding disaster became more apparent , we reached out to additional scientists and engineers from our partners and competitors in the energy industry , as well as engineering firms , academia , government and the military . \nAmong the resources that have been made available : Drilling and technical experts who are helping determine solutions to stopping the spill and mitigating its impact , including specialists in the areas of subsea wells , environmental science and emergency response ; Technical advice on blowout preventers , dispersant application , well construction and containment options ; Additional facilities to serve as staging areas for equipment and responders , more remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- for deep underwater work , barges , support vessels and additional aircraft , as well as training and working space for the Unified Command . \nWorking under the umbrella of the Unified Command , BP 's team of operational and technical experts is coordinating with many federal , state , and local governmental entities and private sector organizations . \nThese include the Departments of Interior , Homeland Security , Energy , and Defense , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , US Fish & Wildlife Service -LRB- USFW -RRB- , National Marine Fisheries Service -LRB- NMFS -RRB- , EPA , OSHA , Gulf Coast state environmental and wildlife agencies , the Marine Spill Response Corporation -LRB- MSRC -RRB- -LRB- an oil spill response organization -RRB- , as well as numerous state , city , parish and county agencies . \nSome of the best minds and the deepest expertise are being brought to bear . \nWith the possible exception of the space program in the 1960s , it is difficult to imagine the gathering of a larger , more technically proficient team in one place in peacetime . \nAnd including BP , industry and government resources , more than 27,000 personnel are now engaged in the response in various activities such as booming , skimming , surveying , clean-up operations , wildlife protection and rehabilitation and claims support . \nIn addition , we are helping to train and organize the more than 19,000 citizen volunteers who have come forward to offer their services . \nThe outpouring of support from government , industry , businesses and private citizens has truly been both humbling and inspiring . \nOur efforts in response to this incident are focused on two critical goals : Successfully stopping the flow of oil ; and Minimizing the environmental and economic impacts from the oil spill . \nThese are without a doubt complex and challenging tasks . \nWhile we have had to overcome hurdles , we are doing everything we can to respond as quickly and effectively as we can . \nFrom the beginning , we have been committed to a transparent response . \nWe know the public wants as much information as possible about this unprecedented event , and we continue to do our best to provide it so the public can understand the incident and its impacts . \nSubsea efforts to secure the well Our first priority is to stop the flow of oil and secure the well . \nWe are currently drilling two relief wells , which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well . \nThe first relief well is currently at a depth of 15,226 feet , and the second relief well is currently at 9,778 feet . \nSeparately , the goal has been to minimize or stop the flow of oil and gas before the relief wells are completed . \nFrom the beginning , we have implemented a multifaceted strategy , featuring a range of technological approaches . \nOur efforts to stop the well from the seabed included a number of interventions to the failed BOP , and the ` top kill ' procedure . \nWe understand the public 's frustration that these approaches did not stop the flow of oil . \nWe , too , were disappointed . \nAlthough we were not able to stop the well at the seabed , our efforts to contain the oil and gas have been more successful . \nWhile our first attempt with a Containment Dome was not successful due to gas hydrate formation , we learned lessons that have underpinned subsequent successes . \nSpecifically , we first deployed a Riser Insertion Tube Tool that overcame these gas hydrate problems and captured more than 2,000 barrels per day for ten days . \nOn June 3 , we replaced this with the Lower Marine Riser Package Cap , which had increased our collection to about 15,000 barrels per day . \nOn Wednesday morning , we were in the early stages of increasing oil and gas collection through our next containment step , the Q4000 Direct Connect . \nIt utilizes much of the subsea ` top kill ' equipment and takes oil directly from the failed BOP to the Q4000 on the surface . \nWe expect to optimize collection over the next few days to levels well above what was previously accomplished . \nIt is important to keep in mind that these techniques have never before been attempted 5,000 feet under water . \nOn the seabed , we have made unprecedented use of ROVs for a variety of tasks , including working on the BOP , positioning riser cutting devices and slings , connecting hoses , positioning containment devices and providing extensive surveying and monitoring . \nWe can not guarantee the outcome of these operations , but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry . \nWe continue to do more to increase our operational flexibility and collection capability . \nThis includes securing vessels with greater processing and storage capacity , adding shuttle tankers for transporting oil , procuring spares of critical equipment , installing permanent riser systems , and replacing the containment cap with a more secure system . \nWe will not rest with our containment efforts until the well is permanently killed . \nI know it feels like this all takes a long time but we are compressing operations that normally take months into days . \nIn addition to these containment operations , and with the approval of the Unified Command and in conjunction with the EPA , we continue injecting dispersant subsea using ROVs . \nDispersant acts by separating the oil into small droplets that can break down more easily through natural processes before they reach the surface . \nUse of dispersant subsea reduces the amount of oil traveling to the surface , which , in turn , reduces the amount of spray dispersant required at the surface . \nIn addition , dispersant use at the source requires approximately one quarter of the amount of dispersant that would be necessary for use on the surface . \nSonar testing and aerial photographs show encouraging results . \nThere has been a lot of discussion about the use of dispersants . \nOn June 4 , a federal panel of experts studying this issue recommended continued use of dispersants after analyzing potential risks and benefits for the environment . \nThe dispersant we are using -- Corexit -- is on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule , which is maintained by the EPA . \nWe will continue to work closely with the EPA to try to identify alternative dispersants and to monitor the situation closely . \nWe will only use dispersants in ways approved by the Unified Command , supported by the EPA and other relevant agencies . \nBP is a `` responsible party '' under the Oil Pollution Act . \nThis means that federal law requires BP , as one of the working interest owners of Mississippi Canyon 252 , to pay to clean up the spill and to compensate for the economic and environmental impacts of the spill . \nLet me be clear : BP has accepted this responsibility and will fulfill this obligation . \nWe have spent nearly $ 1.5 billion so far , and we will not stop until the job is done . \nIt is important to understand that this `` responsible party '' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill . \nInvestigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing , and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available . \nThe focus now is on ensuring that cleanup , and compensation for those harmed by the spill , are carried out as quickly as possible . \nOur cleanup efforts are focused on two fronts : in the open water and at the shoreline . \nOn the open water , more than 4,200 response vessels are in use , including skimmers , storage barges , tugs , and other vessels . \nThe Hoss barge , the world 's largest skimming vessel , has been onsite since April 25 . \nIn addition , there are 49 deepwater skimming vessels , which includes ten 210-foot MSRC Oil Responder Class Vessels , which each have the capacity to collect , separate , and store 4,000 barrels of oily water mix . \nTo date , over 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered . \nAs part of our response efforts , over 2,000 `` Vessels of Opportunity , '' independent vessel owners throughout the Gulf Coast are using their boats in a variety of oil recovery activities , including towing and deploying booms , supporting skimming and burn operations , finding and recovering tar balls and transporting general supplies and personnel . \nAlso on the open water , with the Coast Guard 's approval , we are attacking the spill area with EPA-approved biodegradable dispersants , which are being applied from both planes and boats . \nActions to protect the shoreline Near the shoreline , we are implementing oil spill response contingency plans to protect sensitive areas . \nAccording to the Coast Guard , the result is the most massive shoreline protection effort ever mounted . \nTo support rapid response , we have made available a total of $ 175 million to Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , as well as $ 70 million to assist these states in tourism promotion efforts . \nTo date , we have deployed over 2.5 million feet of containment boom and over 3.0 million feet of sorbent boom in an effort to contain the spill and protect the coastal shoreline . \nThe Department of Defense is helping to airlift boom to wherever it is currently needed across the Gulf coast . \nHighly mobile , shallow draft skimmers are also staged along the coast ready to attack the oil where it approaches the shoreline . \nWildlife clean-up stations have been mobilized , and pre-impact baseline assessment and beach clean-up has been completed in many locations , Shoreline cleanup assessment teams -LRB- SCAT -RRB- are being deployed to affected areas to assess the type and quantity of oiling , so the most effective cleaning strategies can be rapidly applied Our largest single project commitment to date is to fund the $ 360 million cost of six berms in the Louisiana barrier islands project . \nOn June 7 , we announced that we will make an immediate payment of $ 60 million to the state of Louisiana to allow the state to begin work on the project immediately . \nBP will make five additional $ 60 million payments when the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana certifies that the project has satisfied 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % and then 100 % completion milestones . \nThe entire $ 360 million will be funded by the completion of the project . \nIn addition , BP is committing up to $ 500 million to an open research program studying the impact of the Deepwater Horizon incident , and the associated response , on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe program will investigate the impacts of the oil , dispersed oil , and dispersant on the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico and coastal States . \nCommunication , community outreach , & engaging volunteers We are also working hard to keep the public and government officials around the country informed of what is happening . \nWe are regularly briefing federal , state , and local officials , and we are holding town hall sessions to keep affected communities informed . \nBP is also supporting volunteer efforts related to shoreline clean-up . \nWe have partnered with existing volunteer organizations in each of the states to ensure efficient registration and deployment of volunteers to the areas where they can help most . \nUntrained volunteers are not being used for any work involving contact or handling of oil , tar balls , or other hydrocarbon materials . \nThis work is being carried out by trained personnel . \nIn some cases , volunteers who receive more intensive training on the safe handling of hazardous materials and vessel operation for laying boom can become contract employees -LRB- Qualified Community Responders -RRB- . \nThere are twenty-five BP community-outreach sites engaging , training , and preparing volunteers in Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi . \nA phone line has also been established for potential volunteers to register their interest in assisting the response effort . \nWe recognize that beyond the environmental impacts there are also economic impacts on many of the people who rely on the Gulf for their livelihood . \nBP will pay all necessary cleanup costs and all legitimate claims for other losses and damages caused by the spill . \nThe BP claims process is integral to our commitment to do the right thing . \nTo date , BP has already paid out over $ 90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted . \nWhile the initial focus has been on individuals , we are now moving funds on an expedited basis to business owners with nearly $ 16 million to be paid out this week to businesses alone . \nTo ensure the process is as fair and transparent as possible , an independent mediator will be appointed to provide an independent judgment in cases in which BP and a claimant are in disagreement . \nThe mediator will be fully independent of BP , and claimants who disagree with the mediator 's judgment will retain all rights under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 either to seek reimbursement from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund or to file a claim in court . \nThirty-two walk-in claims offices are open in Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi . \nOur call center is operating 24 hours a day , seven days a week . \nWe also have in place an on-line claims filing system . \nNearly 700 people are assigned to handle the claims , including almost 600 experienced claims adjusters working in the impacted communities . \nClaim forms can be filled out in English , Spanish or Vietnamese , and Spanish and Vietnamese translators are available in many offices . \nWe are striving to be efficient and fair and we look for guidance to the established laws , regulations and other information provided by the US Coast Guard , which oversees the process . \nWe will continue adding people , offices and resources as necessary . \nThe question we all want answered is `` What caused this tragic accident ? '' \nA full answer to this and other questions must await the outcome of multiple investigations now underway , including a joint investigation by the Departments of Homeland Security and Interior -LRB- Marine Board -RRB- and an internal investigation by BP itself . \nOur internal investigation was launched on April 21 , 2010 and is being conducted by BP 's Head of Group Safety and Operations . \nThe investigation team 's work thus far suggests that this accident was brought about by the apparent failure of a number of processes , systems and equipment . \nWhile the team 's work is not done , it appears that there were multiple control mechanisms -- procedures and equipment -- in place that should have prevented this accident or reduced the impact of the spill . \nThe investigation is focused on the following seven mechanisms : 1 . \nThe cement that seals the reservoir from the well ; 2 . \nThe casing system , which seals the well bore ; 3 . \nThe pressure tests to confirm the well is sealed ; 4 . \nThe execution of procedures to detect and control hydrocarbons in the well , including the use of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and the maintenance of that BOP ; 5 . \nThe BOP Emergency Disconnect System , which can be activated by pushing a button at multiple locations on the rig ; 6 . \nThe automatic closure of the BOP after its connection is lost with the rig ; and ; 7 . \nFeatures in the BOP to allow ROVs to close the BOP and thereby seal the well at the seabed after a blowout . \nI understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame . \nThe truth , however , is that this is a complex accident , caused by an unprecedented combination of failures . \nA number of companies are involved , including BP , and it is simply too early to understand the cause . \nThere is still extensive work to do . \nThere are events that occurred on April 20 that were not foreseen by me or BP , but which we need to address in the future as lessons learned from this terrible tragedy . \nWith ongoing investigations into the incident and continuing efforts to secure the well , we are in the early stages of trying to learn from this incident . \nBut , as I see it , there are already lessons to be learned , and I wanted to share two of them with you today . \nLesson 1 : Based on the events of April 20 and thereafter , we need to be better prepared for a subsea disaster . \nIt is clear that our industry needs to significantly improve our ability to quickly address deep-sea accidents of this type and magnitude . \nThe industry has made significant strides in preparedness measures before , and we will do so again . \nFollowing the Exxon Valdez oil spill , the industry recognized the need to enhance its capacity to address oil spills . \nThe result was the MSRC , an independent , nonprofit company which maintains a significant inventory of vessels , equipment and trained personnel , complemented by a large contractor work force . \nThe work of MSRC and other contractors has been central to the surface spill response efforts in the Gulf . \nBut based on the events of April 20 and thereafter , it is clear that this is not enough . \nWe now need to develop a similar capability for dealing with large undersea spills . \nWe have no doubt that others in the industry will join us in efforts to develop this capability . \nLesson 2 : Based on what happened on April 20 , we now know we need better safety technology . \nWe in the industry have long relied on the blowout preventer as the principal piece of safety equipment . \nYet , on this occasion it apparently failed , with disastrous consequences . \nWe must use this incident as a case study to avoid a similar failure in the future . \nSince the April 20 explosion and fire , BP has been carefully evaluating the subsea blow-out preventers used in all our drilling operations worldwide , including the testing and maintenance procedures of the drilling contractors using the devices . \nWe will participate in industry-wide efforts to improve the safety and reliability of subsea blowout preventers and deep water drilling practices . \nAnd we will work closely with other interested parties as we do so . \nWe understand the seriousness of the situation . \nWe know the world is watching us . \nNo one will forget the 11 men who lost their lives in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . \nWe hear and understand the concerns , frustrations , and fears that have been and will continue to be voiced . \nI understand that only actions and results , and not mere words , ultimately can give you the confidence you seek . \nWe will be , and deserve to be , judged by our response . \nI give my pledge as leader of BP that we will not rest until we stop this well , mitigate the environmental impact of the spill and address economic claims in a responsible manner . \nNo resource available to this company will be spared . \nWe and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event and emerge from it stronger , smarter and safer .

'' \nUp on the rig , the first thing workers noticed was the sea water in the drill column suddenly shooting back at them , rocketing 240 feet in the air , he said . \nThen , gas surfaced . \n`` What we had learned when I worked as a drill rig laborer was swoosh , boom , run , '' Bea said . \n`` The swoosh is the gas , boom is the explosion and run is what you better be doing . '' \nThe gas flooded into an adjoining room with exposed ignition sources , he said . \n`` That 's where the first explosion happened , '' said Bea , who worked for Shell Oil in the 1960s during the last big northern Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout . \n`` The mud room was next to the quarters where the party was . \nThen there was a series of explosions that subsequently ignited the oil that was coming from below . '' \nAccording to one interview transcript , a gas cloud covered the rig , causing giant engines on the drill floor to run too fast and explode . \nThe engines blew off the rig and set `` everything on fire , '' the account said . \nAnother explosion below blew more equipment overboard . \nBP spokesman John Curry would not comment Friday night on whether methane gas or the series of events described in the internal documents caused the accident . \n`` Clearly , what happened on the Deepwater Horizon was a tragic accident , '' said Curry , who is based at an oil spill command center in Robert , Louisiana . \n`` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation . '' \nThe BP executives were injured but survived , according to one account . \nNine rig crew on the rig floor and two engineers died . \n`` The furniture and walls trapped some and broke some bones but they managed to get in the life boats with assistance from others , '' said the transcript . \nThe reports made Bea , the 73-year-old industry veteran , cry . \n`` It sure as hell is painful , '' he said . \n`` Tears of frustration and anger . '' \nA 100-ton concrete-and-steel vault has been lowered onto the ruptured well , an important step in a delicate and unprecedented attempt to stop most of the gushing crude fouling the sea . \n`` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told The Associated Press . \nUnderwater robots guided the 40-foot-tall box into place in a slow-moving drama . \nNow that the contraption is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it 's stable before the robots can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . \nOn Saturday , the boat with the plumbing equipment for the containment box was about 1.5 miles from the vessel that lowered the box . \nIt 's unclear exactly when the pipework will begin . \n`` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' Salvin said on Friday afternoon , shortly after the four-story device hit the seafloor . \n`` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' \nIt could be Sunday or Monday before officials learn whether the box the size of a house can capture up to 85 percent of the oil . \nThe task became increasingly urgent as toxic oil crept deeper into the bays and marshes of the Mississippi Delta . \nA sheen of oil began arriving on land last week , and crews have been laying booms , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to keep it from coming ashore . \nBut now the thicker , stickier goo -- arrayed in vivid , brick-colored ribbons -- is drawing ever closer to Louisiana 's coastal communities . \nThe Coast Guard and BP said Saturday about 2.1 million gallons of an oil-water mix had been collected , with about 10 percent being oil and the rest water . \nMore than 160 miles of boom to contain the oil has been put out and crews have used nearly 275,000 gallons of chemicals to break up the oil on the water 's surface . \nThere are still untold risks and unknowns with the containment box : The approach has never been tried at such depths , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine , and any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nThe seafloor is pitch black and the water murky , though lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working . \nIf the box works , another one will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak at the bottom of the Gulf . \nAt the same time , crews are drilling sideways into the well in hopes of plugging it up with mud and concrete , and they are working on other ways to cap it . \nInvestigators looking into the cause of the explosion have been focusing on the so-called blowout preventer . \nFederal regulators told The Associated Press Friday that they are going to examine whether these last-resort cutoff valves on offshore oil wells are reliable . \nBlowouts are infrequent , because well holes are blocked by piping and pumped-in materials like synthetic mud , cement and even sea water . \nThe pipes are plugged with cement , so fluid and gas ca n't typically push up inside the pipes . \nInstead , a typical blowout surges up a channel around the piping . \nThe narrow space between the well walls and the piping is usually filled with cement , so there is no pathway for a blowout . \nBut if the cement or broken piping leaves enough space , a surge can rise to the surface . \nThere , at the wellhead of exploratory wells , sits the massive steel contraption known as a blowout preventer . \nIt can snuff a blowout by squeezing rubber seals tightly around the pipes with up to 1 million pounds of force . \nIf the seals fail , the blowout preventer deploys a last line of defense : a set of rams that can slice right through the pipes and cap the blowout . \nDeepwater Horizon was also equipped with an automated backup system called a Deadman . \nIt should have activated the blowout preventer even if workers could not . \nBased on the interviews with rig workers , none of those safeguards worked . \n"}
{"id": "640", "time": "2010-06-10", "text": "June 8 : The Transocean Discoverer Enterprise burns off some natural gas as it takes on oil from the broken BP wellhead at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . \nGRAND ISLE , La. -- BP said Thursday that it plans to boost its ability to directly capture hundreds of thousands of oil gushing from a well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico by early next week . \nKent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production , said a semi-submersible drilling rig would capture and burn about 420,000 gallons of oil daily . \nOnce on board , the oil and gas collected from the well will be sent down a boom and burned at sea . \nA drill ship already at the scene can process a maximum of 756,000 gallons of oil daily that 's sucked up through a containment cap sitting on the well head . \nThe containment effort played out as BP stock continued to plunge amid fears that the company might be forced to suspend dividends and find itself overwhelmed by the cleanup costs , penalties , damage claims and lawsuits generated by the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . \nBut markets were also beginning to heed warnings from analysts who said Wednesday 's 15.8 percent sell-off of BP shares in New York was an overreaction . \nBP shares dropped as much as 11 percent to a 13-year low at the open in London on Thursday , then recovered some ground by early afternoon , trading 6.1 percent lower at $ 5.39 . \nIn New York , the stock opened 9.8 percent higher at $ 32.05 . \nBP has lost around half its market value since the spill began with the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and set off the spill in the Gulf . \nIn the seven weeks since then , the company has lost half its market value . \nIn a federal filing Thursday , the company said the cost of its response to the oil spill has grown to $ 1.43 billion . \nThe latest slide came after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar promised a Senate energy panel to ask BP to compensate energy companies for losses if they have to lay off workers or suffer economically because of the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling . \nIn an interview Thursday on ABC 's '' Good Morning America , '' Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu reiterated her call to end the moratorium , saying it will cause economic hardship in the region . \n`` Every one of these 33 deep-water wells employs , directly , hundreds of people and indirectly thousands , '' she said . \nCleanup continued along the Gulf Coast . \nIn Orange Beach , Ala. , reddish-brown globs of oil the size of credit cards littered the beach at the tide line as a blue farm tractor loaded with shovels and other cleanup equipment chugged down the beach . \nDozens of workers in orange vests and blue jeans prepared to start their day combing the beach for oil . \nShrimpers , oystermen , seafood businesses , out-of-work drilling crews and the tourism industry who have filed damage claims with BP also are angrily complaining of delays , excessive paperwork and skimpy payments that have put them on the verge of going under as the financial and environmental toll of the seven-week-old disaster grows . \n`` Every day we call the adjuster eight or 10 times . \nThere 's no answer , no answering machine , '' said Regina Shipp , who has filed $ 33,000 in claims for lost business at her restaurant in Alabama . \n`` If BP does n't pay us within two months , we 'll be out of business . \nWe 've got two kids . '' \nBP spokesman Mark Proegler disputed any notion that the claims process is slow or that the company is dragging its feet . \nProegler said BP has cut the time to process claims and issue a check from 45 days to as little as 48 hours , if the necessary documentation has been supplied . \nBP officials acknowledged that while no claims have been denied , thousands and thousands had not been paid by late last week because the company required more documentation . \nAt the bottom of the sea , the containment cap on the ruptured well is capturing 630,000 gallons a day and pumping it to a ship at the surface , and the amount could nearly double by next week to roughly 1.17 million gallons , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who is overseeing the crisis for the government . \nA second vessel expected to arrive within days should greatly boost capacity . \nBP also plans to bring in a tanker from the North Sea to help transport oil and an incinerator to burn off some of the crude . \nThe additional system will use equipment previously employed to shoot heavy drilling mud down the well in an attempt to stop the flow , although this time the process will work in reverse . \nOil will flow in lines from beneath the blowout preventer , a stack of piping on the sea floor , to a semi-submersible drilling rig called the Q4000 . \nOil and gas siphoned from the well will flow up the rig , where it will be sent down a boom , turned into a mist and ignited using a burner designed by Schlumberger Ltd. . \nBP opted to burn the oil because storing it would require bringing in even more vessels to the already crowded seas above the leaking well . \n`` It was going to become too congested , it was not the safest way to do it , '' Wells said . \nTesting on the oil-burning system should begin over the weekend , and full production should start early next week , Wells said . \nThe government has estimated 600,000 to 1.2 million gallons are leaking per day , but a scientist on a task force studying the flow said the actual rate may be between 798,000 gallons and 1.8 million . \nA task force member said an estimate come Thursday or Friday . \nCrews working at the site toiled under oppressive conditions as the heat index soared to 110 degrees and toxic vapors emanated from the depths . \nFireboats were on hand to pour water on the surface to ease the fumes . \nAllen also has confronted BP over the complaints about the claims process , warning the company in a letter : `` We need complete , ongoing transparency into BP 's claims process including detailed information on how claims are being evaluated , how payment amounts are being calculated and how quickly claims are being processed . '' \nUnder federal law , BP is required to pay for a range of losses , including property damage and lost earnings . \nResidents and businesses can call a telephone line to report losses , file a claim online and seek help at one of 25 claims offices around the Gulf . \nTo jump-start the process , BP was initially offering an immediate $ 2,500 to deckhands and $ 5,000 to fishing boat owners . \nWorkers can receive additional compensation once their paperwork and larger claims are approved . \nBP said it has paid 18,000 claims so far and has hired 600 adjusters and operators to handle the cases . \nA Closer Look at the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}
{"id": "179", "time": "2010-06-10", "text": "Apr. 21 : An oil slick is seen as the Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP NEW ORLEANS -- Glaring errors and omissions in BP 's oil spill response plans have exposed a slapdash effort to follow environmental rules , outraging Gulf Coast residents who can see on their beaches how unprepared the company was . \nBP PLC 's 582-page regional spill plan for the Gulf , and its 52-page , site-specific plan for the Deepwater Horizon rig vastly understate the dangers posed by an uncontrolled leak and vastly overstate the company 's preparedness to deal with one , according to an Associated Press analysis . \nThe lengthy plans were approved by the federal government last year before BP drilled its ill-fated well . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was incensed Wednesday after reading the AP story and said BP has been reactive -- not proactive -- all along . \n`` Look , it 's obvious to everybody in south Louisiana that they did n't have a plan , they did n't have an adequate plan to deal with this spill , '' Jindal said . \n`` They did n't anticipate the BOP -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- failure . \nThey did n't anticipate this much oil hitting our coast . \nFrom the very first days , they kept telling us , ` Do n't worry , the oil 's not going to make it to your coast . ' '' \nAmong the glaring errors in the report : A professor is listed in BP 's 2009 response plan for a Gulf of Mexico oil spill as a national wildlife expert . \nHe died in 2005 . \nThe plan lists cold-water marine mammals including walruses , sea otters , sea lions and seals as `` sensitive biological resources . '' \nNone of those animals live anywhere near the Gulf . \nAlso , names and phone numbers of several Texas A&M University marine life specialists are wrong . \nSo are the numbers for marine mammal stranding network offices in Louisiana and Florida , which are disconnected . \n`` The AP report paints a picture of a company that was making it up as it went along , while telling regulators it had the full capability to deal with a major spill , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Fla . \n, wrote in an e-mail to the AP . \n`` We know that was n't true . '' \nNelson said he and Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . \n, have asked for a criminal investigation into some of the company 's claims . \nEarlier this month , the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nAttorney General Eric Holder has not said who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \nLegal experts say that to file criminal charges , the Justice Department will have to find evidence that BP or other companies involved in the deadly oil rig explosion and subsequent spill orchestrated a coverup , destroyed key documents or lied to government agents . \nCharges and civil penalties can be brought under a variety of environmental protection laws . \nIn its Deepwater Horizon plan , the British oil giant stated : `` BP Exploration and Production Inc. has the capability to respond , to the maximum extent practicable , to a worst case discharge , or a substantial threat of such a discharge , resulting from the activities proposed in our Exploration Plan . '' \nIn the spill scenarios detailed in the documents , fish , marine mammals and birds escape serious harm ; beaches remain pristine ; water quality is only a temporary problem . \nAnd those are the projections for a leak about 10 times worse than what has been calculated for the ongoing disaster . \nRep. Darrell Issa of California , the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform committee , is investigating failures by the federal Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs . \nHe said Wednesday that if there had been a serious effort to reform the agency , the `` mistakes '' in BP 's report would have been caught . \n`` This is yet another example of MMS acting as a rubber stamp for industry , and industry settling for the lowest possible standard of safety at the expense the environment and economic vitality of the Gulf region , '' he said . \nBP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the response plans will be reviewed `` so that we can determine what worked well and what needs improvement . '' \n`` Thus far we have implemented the largest spill response in history and many , many elements of it have worked well . \nHowever , we are greatly disappointed that oil has made landfall and impacted shorelines and marshes . \nThe situation we are dealing with is clearly complex , unprecedented and will offer us much to learn from , '' Beaudo said . \nThe plans contain wildly false assumptions about oil spills . \nBP 's proposed method to calculate spill volume judging by the darkness of the oil sheen is way off . \nThe internationally accepted formula would produce estimates 100 times higher . \nThe Gulf 's loop current , which is projected to help eventually send oil hundreds of miles around Florida 's southern tip and up the Atlantic coast , is n't mentioned in either plan . \nThe website listed for Marine Spill Response Corp. -- one of two firms that BP relies on for equipment to clean a spill -- links to a defunct Japanese-language page . \nIn early May , at least 80 Louisiana state prisoners were trained to clean birds by listening to a presentation and watching a video . \nIt was a work force never envisioned in the plans , which contain no detailed references to how birds would be cleansed of oil . \nAnd while BP officials and the federal government have insisted that they have attacked the problem as if it were a much larger spill , that is n't apparent from the constantly evolving nature of the response . \nAsked if he was angry about the inadequate plans , Jindal said : `` Absolutely . \nYou ca n't just assume the best . \nYour plan ca n't be , well , the BOP is going to work . \nYour plan ca n't be , well , the oil is not going to travel more than 50 miles and reach our coast . \nYour plan ca n't be that if the BOP does n't work , then the junk shot is going to work , then the mud kill shot is going to work . '' \nThis week , after BP reported the seemingly good news that a containment cap installed on the wellhead was funneling some of the gushing crude to a tanker on the surface , BP introduced a whole new set of plans mostly aimed at capturing more oil . \nThe latest incarnation calls for building a larger cap , using a special incinerator to burn off some of the recaptured oil and bringing in a floating platform to process the oil being sucked away from the gushing well . \nIn other words , the on-the-fly planning continues . \nOne of the most glaring errors in BP 's plans involves Dr. Peter Lutz , a Florida professor , one of several dozen experts recommended as resources to be contacted in the event of a spill . \nLutz is listed as a go-to wildlife specialist at the University of Miami . \nBut Lutz , an eminent sea turtle expert , left Miami almost 20 years ago to chair the marine biology department at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton . \nHe died four years before the plan was published . \nMolly Lutcavage , a research professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who worked closely with Lutz on a groundbreaking report on the effects of oil on sea turtles , was dismayed to hear that Lutz was still listed in the response plan . \n`` It 's horribly depressing and shocking that so little attention is paid to a bona fide contingency plan , '' she said . \n`` What would Peter think ? \nI think he would think it was typical of bureaucracy . '' \nThere are other examples of how BP 's plans have fallen short : -- Beaches where oil washed up within weeks of a spill were supposed to be safe from contamination because BP promised it could marshal more than enough boats to scoop up all the oil before any deepwater spill could reach shore -- a claim that in retrospect seems absurd . \n`` The vessels in question maintain the necessary spill containment and recovery equipment to respond effectively , '' one of the documents says . \nBP asserts that the combined response could skim , suck up or otherwise remove 20 million gallons of oil each day from the water . \nBut that is about how much has leaked in the past six weeks -- and the slick now covers about 3,300 square miles , according to Hans Graber , director of the University of Miami 's satellite sensing facility . \nOnly a small fraction of the spill has been successfully skimmed . \nPlus , an undetermined portion has sunk to the bottom of the Gulf or is suspended somewhere in between . \nThe plan uses computer modeling to project a 21 percent chance of oil reaching the Louisiana coast within a month of a spill . \nIn reality , an oily sheen reached the Mississippi River delta just nine days after the April 20 explosion . \nHeavy globs soon followed . \nOther locales where oil washed up within weeks of the explosion were characterized in BP 's regional plan as safely out of the way of any oil danger . \n-- BP 's site plan regarding birds , sea turtles or endangered marine mammals -LRB- `` no adverse impacts '' -RRB- also have proved far too optimistic . \nWhile the exact toll on the Gulf 's wildlife may never be known , the effects clearly have been devastating . \nMore than 400 oiled birds have been treated , while dozens have been found dead and covered in crude , mainly in Louisiana but also in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nMore than 200 lifeless turtles , several dolphins and countless fish also have washed ashore . \nThe response plans anticipate nothing on this scale . \nThere were n't supposed to be any coastline problems because the site was far offshore . \n`` Due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected , '' the site plan says . \nBut that distance has failed to protect precious resources . \nAnd last week , a group of environmental research center scientists released a computer model that suggested oil could ride ocean currents around Florida and up to North Carolina by summer . \n-- Perhaps the starkest example of BP 's planning failures : The company has insisted that the size of the leak does n't matter because it has been reacting to a worst-case scenario all along . \nWhile a disaster as devastating as a major oil spill will create unforeseen problems , BP 's plans do not anticipate even the most obvious issues , and use mountains of words to dismiss problems that have proven overwhelming . \nIn responses to lengthy lists of questions from AP , the Interior Department , which oversees the MMS , appears to concede there were problems with the two oil spill response plans . \n`` Many of the questions you raise are exactly those questions that will be examined and answered by the presidential commission as well as other investigations into BP 's oil spill , '' said Kendra Barkoff , spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar . \nShe added that Salazar has undertaken reforms of MMS . \nA key failure of the plan 's cleanup provisions was the scarcity of boom -- floating lines of plastic or absorbent material placed around sensitive areas to deflect oil . \nFrom the start , local officials all along the Gulf Coast have complained about a lack of supplies , particularly the heavier , so-called ocean boom . \nBut even BP says in its regional plan that boom is n't effective in seas more than three to four feet ; waves in the Gulf are often bigger . \nAnd even in calmer waters , oil has swamped vital wildlife breeding grounds in places supposedly sequestered by multiple layers of boom . \nThe BP plans speak of thorough resources for all ; there 's no talk of a need to share . \nStill , Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said his shores were left vulnerable by Coast Guard decisions to shift boom to Louisiana when the oil threatened landfall there . \nMeanwhile , in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish , some have complained that miles of the boom now in the water were not properly anchored . \nAP reporters saw evidence they 're right -- some lines of boom were so broken up they hardly impeded the slick 's push to shore . \nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Ted Bridis and Eileen Sullivan in Washington , Brian Skoloff in Grand Isle , La. , Harry R. Weber in Houston , and Jason Bronis in New Orleans . \nMohr reported from Venice , La. . \nPritchard reported from Los Angeles . \n"}

Bush in the days following hurricane Katrina . \nAnd today , the Obama White House said waivers might again be considered . \nIf there is the need for any type of waiver , that would obviously be granted , said White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs . \nBut , we 've not had that problem thus far . \nDemocratic Senator Bill Nelson is not so sure about that . \nHe s hearing from the folks back home in Florida , where they want all the skimmer ships they can get . \nHe sent a letter to Admiral Thad Allen today which read in part : Admiral , I believe the orange mousse of oil that is now in Florida s waters is more than enough evidence that we need to take advantage of every appropriate global resource . \nPlease advise as to whether we are taking full advantage of the offers of assistance from other countries . \nWhen asked about this by Fox News , Admiral Allen said , If it gets to the point where a Jones Act waiver is required , we 're willing to do that too Nobody has come to me with a request for a Jones Act waiver . \nAfter 50 plus days of oil flowing freely into the gulf , the question could be asked : Why do effective and proven foreign clean up ships remain on the sidelines ? \nCarafano believes it may have something to do with the Obama administration s close relationship with labor unions . \nCause this is a big thing for unions , Carafano said . \nThe unions see it as protecting jobs . \nThey hate when the Jones Act gets waived , and they pound on politicians when they do that . \nSo are we giving in to unions and not doing everything we can , or is there some kind of impediment that we do n't know about ? \nIf the Obama Administration needs an example of what can happen when global assets are allowed to tackle a massive oil spill , they need look no further than Saudi Aramco s clean up of a massive wartime spill off the Kuwaiti coast in 1991 . \nAramco summoned every available ship to assist in the cleanup . \nThe company claims it recovered 900,000 barrels of oil in roughly three months . \nThe industry views that effort as the gold standard in oil spill cleanups . \nFOX News covers the action from all the angles . \nGet constant updates from our in-the-field reporters and producers and read stories you 'll only see here . \n"}

'' \nThe admiral this week created a team including officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help with the damage claims . \nIt will send workers into Gulf communities to provide information about the process . \nHe also planned to discuss the complaints with BP officials Wednesday . \nUnder federal law , BP is required to pay for a range of damage , including property losses and lost earnings . \nResidents and businesses can call a telephone line to report losses , file a claim online and seek help at one of 25 claims offices around the Gulf . \nDeckhands and other fishermen generally need to show a photo ID and documentation such as a pe was instructed to gather the same documents and this time go to a claims office . \nThere , an adjuster told Walter he would be eligible for only a $ 5,000 payment since his tax returns showed a technical business loss when depreciation was factored in . \n`` I said that 's not fair because if you say that , then I have to go out of business and I lose everything , '' Walter said . \nHe is now working with an accounting firm to calculate his losses . \nNot everyone had complaints about the claims process . \nBart Harrison of Clay , Ala. , filed his first claim on Wednesday morning for lost rental income on his coastal property and expected to have a check for $ 1,010 within a few hours . \nThe only documentation required was tax returns and rental histories for his units , which were both easy to provide . \n`` The guy I talked to was knowledgeable and respectful . \nIt seemed like he really wanted to write a check and please me since it was my first time in , '' Harrison said . \n"}
{"id": "703", "time": "2010-11-17", "text": "Nov. 9 : BP performs a deep sand cleaning operation in Orange Beach , Ala. . \nAP ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- What 's typically a beautiful , quiet stretch of beach in the fall now resembles a construction site . \nBulldozers and yellow dump trucks shake the ground ; a giant sifting machine spits clean sand out one end , tar balls out another . \nWith its Macondo well dead and few visitors on the coast during the offseason , BP has launched its biggest push yet to deep-clean the tourist beaches that were coated with crude during the worst of the Gulf oil spill . \nMachines are digging down into the sand to remove buried tar mats left from the Deepwater Horizon disaster . \nThe work is getting mixed reviews . \nMany are anxious to see the beaches cleaned as quickly as possible by whatever means are available . \nOthers say BP may be making matters worse by bringing heavy equipment onto beaches and spreading the petroleum stain . \nSome fear fresh environmental damage from the work itself , which can kill tiny creatures that live in the sand . \nEven BP acknowledges that fresh tar balls are still hitting the coast , meaning some of the work might be premature . \nStill , local officials have given the company a Jan. 1 deadline to be done . \nThe project began last month on Perdido Key at the Alabama-Florida line , and crews with sifting machines large and small are spreading out to the east and west . \nOn a sunny day in mid-November , ground zero is the wide stretch of sand between the Gulf 's crystal water and the Silver Beach condos in Orange Beach . \nThat 's where Sue Rose has her ground-floor unit , and she was happy to see heavy machinery loading sand into a boxlike sifter just outside her door . \nThe machine strains tons of dirty sand at a time through fine screens , and trucks then dump the cleaned sand back on to the beach . \nThe refuse is taken to landfills . \n`` It 's wonderful , '' said Rose , of Erlanger , Ky. `` Hopefully we 're going to get our clean beach back . '' \nA few miles away at Perdido Key , Fla. , longtime resident Terry Hanners has his doubts . \nHe sees what appears to be an ever-expanding oil stain on the beach and fears the once-white sand will remain its current brownish tint , which is close to the color of weak tea . \n`` They 're just spreading it , '' said Hanners . \n`` We have a stain that 's going to stay with us a while . '' \nAn April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to more than 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's undersea well . \nSeven months later , BP has settled on a multi-pronged cleaning approach at the urging of local leaders who fear a collapse of the region 's tourist economy if all remnants of oil are n't gone from the beaches before tourists begin arriving in large numbers again next spring . \nThousands of workers roamed the coast with shovels and plastic bags all summer , picking up as much oil as they could as it washed in . \nThere was no way to get all of it , though , and waves and tidal action soon buried large patches of tar and crude on beaches . \nFaced with pressure to remove all the oil , BP sent assessment teams to beaches with augers to look for buried oil . \nSpots were marked and catalogued , and contractors worked with government officials on a plan for attacking the oil under the surface even as smaller amounts of oil continue to wash in . \nToday , machines resembling agricultural harvesters move slowly along the beach digging about 18 inches below the surface in search of buried oil . \nSand is lifted by a conveyor system and dumped onto screens ; clean sand is expelled from the contraption , called a Sand Shark , while rust-colored tar balls , broken shells and other trash collect in a bin . \nWorkers are using a much larger cleaning system called a Powerscreen to scrub broader areas of beach . \nDozers pile up sand , which a big machine with a bucket dumps into the sifter . \nCleaned sand is ejected by one belt while tar and other material goes another way . \nWorkers have dug down about 30 inches so far to find oil , and officials say the dozers can dig as deep as needed to get the worst of the oil deposits . \nDifferent , gentler cleaning methods will be used in more delicate areas like Mississippi 's coastal islands and the marshlands of Louisiana , the company says . \nBP spokesman Ray Melick says the major work should be done by mid-February , before the weather turns warm and visitors begin heading back . \nNatural processes should finish cleaning tourist areas once the big machines have dug up all the oil they can . \n`` I think we 'll get 99 percent of what 's out there . \nThere may be some little BB-sized tar balls that get left , but over time nature will take care of that on its own and it will just sort of dissolve back into the surface , '' he said . \nLooking to speed up nature , the company also is pumping salt water on to the beach in some areas in an attempt to rinse away the oil residue and speed up the bleaching process , he said . \nThe work has raised concern among environmentalists who fear the heavy machinery will kill creatures that live on the beach or cause erosion problems as the natural lay of the land is disturbed . \nMarine scientist George Crozier says the work is doing some damage , like killing small ghost crabs that live in the dry sand . \n`` Certainly there 's going to be a lot of impact , but I do n't know if it 's going to be significant impact , '' said Crozier , the longtime head of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab . \nHe favors letting the buried oil remain where it is : buried . \nTony Kennon is worried about a different type of impact -- the loss of tourist dollars if there 's another oil-stained season in Orange Beach , where he serves as mayor . \nPeople do n't like the idea of an oily beach , even if they ca n't see the pollution , he said , and a hurricane could easily expose buried oil deposits , creating a new wave of concern . \nBusiness was off about 50 percent this year because the spill scared away tourists , and Kennon says the town 's economy could n't take another blow like that . \nKennon has given BP a deadline of New Year 's Day to finish the deep-cleaning work on Orange Beach 's nine miles of coast . \n`` If they want me to sign off on it , it 's going to have to be white and squeaky clean , '' said Kennon . \n`` We sell ourselves on sugar-white beaches . \nIf we do n't have that at the end of all this , we need compensation .

'' \nThe total amount Gillers will be paid is unclear . \nHe told The Associated Press he is billing $ 950 an hour for his services and an assistant is billing $ 475 an hour . \nGillers said he and the assistant have not calculated exactly how many hours they spent on the work , which Gillers said is now finished . \nGCCF spokeswoman Debra DeShong Reed said neither Feinberg nor the fund have any past relationship with Gillers . \nShe said he was chosen because he is a nationally recognized expert in the field of legal ethics . \nGillers said his work for Feinberg included reading the letter Caldwell sent Feinberg , reading court papers filed by lawyers suing BP , and researching rules governing lawyers in Gulf Coast states and in Washington , where Feinberg 's law firm is located . \nBoth Gillers and Feinberg said they do n't believe there is anything wrong with using BP money to pay for the advice . \n`` Is he being paid by BP money ? \nYes , '' Feinberg said . \n`` Who else is going to pay for the entire cost of this program ? \nYou ca n't ask claimants to pay , you ca n't ask states and federal governments to pay . \nThe buck stops with BP and BP has agreed to pay the entire cost of the infrastructure of this program . '' \nBut Anthony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , Ala. , has questions about the relationship between Feinberg and BP . \n`` He can proclaim independence as much as he wants , '' said Kennon , whose community was hard hit by the oil spill . \n`` The only thing that will show true independence is if he makes those people whole who were harmed by the oil spill . \nWe have not been made whole by a long shot . '' \nLawyers who have already filed more than 300 lawsuits on behalf of Gulf residents and businesses say Feinberg should stop calling himself independent . \nThey asked a federal judge last week to order changes to the release form people must sign if they accept a final payment from Feinberg . \nFeinberg currently requires people who accept final payments to agree not to sue BP or any other responsible party , including companies involved with the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded April 20 off Louisiana 's coast . \nThe blast killed 11 workers and led to 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico , according to government estimates that BP disputes . \nThe lawyers say people should only have to give up the right to sue BP for compensatory damages , but they should still be allowed to go after BP in court for punitive damages . \nAnd , the lawyers say , people who accept final payments from the fund should be allowed to sue other responsible parties for both compensatory and punitive damages . \nSo far , the fund has paid out roughly $ 2.6 billion . \nMoney left over in the fund is expected to be returned to BP . \n"}

Charlie Crist , were considering opening those waters to drilling before the spill . \nOn Wednesday , Crist called the decision `` wonderful news . '' \n`` That 's news that will be very favorably received by the tourist industry throughout the state , but also by the people , '' Crist said . \nHe also said he 's not surprised that the BP spill would make the administration take another look at its management plan , considering it was one of the country 's largest environmental disasters . \n`` If that 's not a wake-up call , I do n't know what would be , '' Crist said . \n`` If that does n't have an impact on your thinking , you must not be thinking .

Richard Shelby , R-Ala . \n, who met with Feinberg Friday , said the claim fund is not moving `` with appropriate urgency '' and people are n't getting the payments they deserve . \n`` Businesses along the Gulf Coast are not only trying to survive now but also prepare for the next tourist season , which is quickly approaching , '' Shelby said . \n`` These victims deserve a fair opportunity to appeal inadequate payments , particularly in light of the lack of transparency , clarity , and consistency in the payment process . '' \nAssociate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli wrote Feinberg on Friday to ask him to expedite the process , which the Justice Department has complained is forcing individuals to wait for payment without the means to support themselves . \n`` While you have indicated that poor documentation has made it difficult to address some claims quickly , over the past two weeks the number of claims requiring additional documentation has actually gone down -- while the number of claims under review has increased significantly , '' Perrelli wrote to Feinberg . \nIn a statement to Fox News , Feinberg , whose company is earning $ 850,000 a month to administer the claims , said he 's responding to the government 's complaints . \n`` I think it 's always wise to listen carefully to constructive criticism from the Department of Justice , '' Feinberg said . \n`` They want me to improve transparency , and I plan to do so . '' \nFeinberg said he estimates that about $ 6 billion of the fund will be spent , including government and cleanup claims , allowing BP to reclaim the remainder once all the settlements are paid out by August 2013 . \nHe added that the fund is doing the best it can given the more than 400,000 claims filed so far . \nOf those paid out , 80 percent have received full compensation . \nBut another 147,000 are clogging up the process because they have little or no documentation to support losses , Feinberg said , noting dozens are under review for potential fraud . \nAbout 60,000 claims have already been denied payment , and nearly 72,000 remain under review . \nThose companies and individuals who receive a pay-out from BP will forfeit their right to sue the company over the oil spill that lasted more than 100 days after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 22 . \nEleven rig workers died and about 5 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico scaring away tourists from beaches and freezing the fishing industry . \nBut victims are n't bereft of alternatives if they file now and have to wait for compensation . \nThe fund is open for three years , and victims can receive interim payments by submitting for accumulating damages every three months during the application process . \nThat also allows them the option to back out and sue BP . \nShelby said that decision arose from a pledge by Feinberg to address concerns . \n`` Any business that believes it was treated unfairly will now be able to file for an interim payment every three months for the next three years . \n... I appreciate Mr. Feinberg 's pledge , but I will be monitoring the situation closely to see that it is fulfilled , '' he said . \nOn the flip side , those who decide to wait out the process may find that a gamble since the Gulf recovery could limit their options for claiming losses . \n`` If they decide a year from now , I 'll take the final payment , they 're going to have to show prospective damage , '' Feinberg said in a recent interview with The Associated Press . \n`` But my offer may not be available to them a year from now if everything is back to normal .

British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward goes `` On the Record . '' \nVAN SUSTEREN : Mr. Hayward , thank you for joining us . \nTONY HAYWARD , BP CEO : Thank you very much for the opportunity . \nVAN SUSTEREN : I know that this is both a catastrophe and an emergency . \nTell me , where do you stand right now in trying to contain that leak ? \nHAYWARD : Well , we are working this , as you know very aggressively in three ways , in the subsea to eliminate the leak , on the surface to contain the spill to the greatest extent possible in the area of the leak , and thirdly to defend the shoreline and prevent any oil from getting to the shore . \nIn terms of the subsea interventions , we are pursuing multiple occupy shuns in parallel . \nSo we tried the large dome over the weekend . \nIt was n't successful . \nToo much hydrate formation , a consequence of there being much greater gas in the flow of hydrocarbons than we had anticipated . \nSo we are now moving to deploy over the next 72 hours , a smaller containment device , a so-called top hat , which is described like that because it looks like a top hat , put in the water , on the end of a piece of drill pipe to fit over the leak . \nWe 'll be doing that over the next 72 hours . \nIn parallel there are a series of other operations being planned on the blow-out preventer , most importantly the so-called top kill or junk shot whereby we would pump into the blowout preventer material to clog it up and stop the flow . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Where the hydration is , is n't that ineffective because it blocks it ? \nIs that why that 's been ineffective ? \nAnd why has n't that effective in containing the leak ? \nHAYWARD : The issue is the quantity of gas and seawater in the large dome . \nThat is a difficult combination . \nSo , by moving to a smaller dome we 'll have less seawater and , hopefully , a better chance of minimizing the hydrate formation and being able to get in sort of system to work . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Are you getting everything you need ? \nI realize BP is scrambling . \nI think it is too early to start blaming . \nWe have a catastrophe with we need to contain . \nBut are you getting assistance from around the world in terms of scientific assistant from the government , man power ? \nDo you need anything at all at this point ? \nHAYWARD : This is now an oil and gas industry task force with significant input from government scientists and technologists from the Department of Energy , the Navy , Department of Defense . \nSo there is gathered in Houston , which is where I 'm talking to you from , a team of nearly 1,000 people , many of them technologists and scientists grappling with this problem . \nThis is , if you like , the oil and gas industry now focused on an oil and gas industry global problem . \nVAN SUSTEREN : What the odds this smaller dome is going to work ? \nI realize we do n't know you are just implementing it . \nBut the bigger dome did n't work . \nWhen you talked to the scientists the people in Houston , are they hopeful , or is this also a high-risk operation ? \nHAYWARD : I think we need to recognize that none of this has been done in 5,000 feet of water . \nThat is the reality . \nWe are working on the absolute frontier of the industry . \nIt is -- a number of people have made this analogy , I think it is not unreasonable -- this is a lot like the Apollo 13 moon shot . \nWe have the piece as assembled on the table and we are trying to figure out what is the right intervention . \nAn important thing is that we are learning all the time . \nWe are learning all the time about what is likely to work from the interventions that we are making . \nSo , we ca n't be overly confident that this next intervention will work . \nBut it will not have the same scale of hydrate problem that we had with the first go . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Let 's say Plan A failed , the bigger dome , Plan B is the smaller dome , hoping less of a hydrate problem . \nIn the horrible , awful event that Plan B does n't work , what is Plan C ? \nHAYWARD : So Plan C is the so-called junk shot , top kill , where we connect two flexible hoses to the top of the blowout preventer and pump material to block up the blowout preventer . \nPlan D is to remove what is called the riser with which is sitting above the blowout preventer and put in place another blowout preventer . \nThere 's a Plan E and a Plan F. So we are working through a whole series of options that are being developed and engineered in parallel and deploying them in time sequence . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Any idea the estimate of how much oil is being pumped - - how much is that leak right now ? \nI 've seen lots of estimates . \nHAYWARD : There is no accurate way of estimating this , I 'm afraid . \nThere is not a meter on the sea bed . \nYou have to estimate what is on the surface , which itself is something of an estimation , and then back calculate based on the amounts of oil that evaporates and is dispersed as it travels up through the sea column . \nSo the numbers are genuinely guesstimates at this point . \nBut what we can say that the containment efforts of subsea dispersant , on the surface , skimming on the surface , and booming on the surface is retaining the vast majority of the oil in the vicinity of the leak . \nVAN SUSTEREN : In terms of other drilling rigs are there any other ones right now at risk in the Gulf of Mexico ? \nThere 's a lot of attention on this one . \nBut as you look around the Gulf , should we be worried tonight ? \nHAYWARD : BP has no other drilling operations ongoing at the current time . \nThe MMS , regulatory agency has put out a series of safety alerts to other rigs that are drilling requiring them to make additional safety measures and assessments . \nVAN SUSTEREN : As I understand , I 'm sure it is obvious I 'm not an expert in this , but the blowout preventer failed us in this particular instance , leading to this catastrophe . \nDid it not have redundancy ? \nAnd in terms of the MMS , the department of interior in Washington that is supposed to regulate safety , did they have requirements that it have a redundancy ? \nHAYWARD : The blowout preventer had three levels of redundancy . \nThey 've all failed . \nWe do n't understand why that is the case . \nThat will clearly be something that the investigation focuses on very significantly . \nI think that -- this is a terrible accident , and , as you say , something that is very , very serious . \nWe need to understand what has happened here . \nIt is the first time in 20 years of drilling in the deep water globally that we 've had an incident of this sort to deal with . \nAnd clearly the investigation will make findings which , I would expect , would change in a significant way industry practices and regulation over this sort of equipment . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Sir , there 's no question that everyone wants a full and thorough investigation so that never happens again . \nThere are some congressional hearings that are starting this week . \nAnd I 'm all in favor of your company being grilled and looked at to see what did wrong or right or whatever . \nBut I 'm curious , are these hearings coming too soon so some of your resources that should be diverted or some of you attention to stopping this leak is being distracted by the hearings ? \nAre these hearings creating a time problem for you at all ? \nHAYWARD : I think it is reasonable and right that Congress should take a very active interest in this . \nAnd we have found a way of managing to deal with their concerns while not interrupting our ongoing operations . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Good luck , sir . \nWe sure hope that gets contained soon , thank you sir . \nHAYWARD : Thank you very much for the opportunity . \nContent and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. . \nAll materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , displayed , published or broadcast without the prior written permission of Roll Call . \nYou may not alter or remove any trademark , copyright or other notice from copies of the content . \n"}

'' \n`` That was to be the fail-safe in case of an accident , '' McKay said , pointedly noting that the 450-ton blowout protector -- as well as the rig itself -- was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nOf the 126 people on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it was engulfed in flames , only seven were BP employees , said McKay . \nBut Steven Newman , CEO of Transocean , which owns the rig , suggested it was n't his company at fault . \n`` The most significant clue is that these events occurred after the well construction process was essentially complete . \nDrilling had been finished on April 17 as the well had been sealed with casing and cement . \nFor that reason , the one thing we do know is that on the evening of April 20 there was a sudden , catastrophic failure of the cement , casing or both , '' Newman said . \n`` Without a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . \nIt is also clear the drill crew had little if any time to react . \nThe initial indications of trouble and the subsequent explosion were almost instantaneous . '' \nBut Tim Probert , an executive with Halliburton Inc. , the subcontractor responsible for encasing the well pipe in cement before plugging it -- a process dictated by BP 's drilling plan -- said his company finished its work `` in accordance with the requirements '' set out by BP He said pressure tests were conducted after the cementing work was finished to demonstrate well integrity . \nWhile the hearings are under way , BP is looking for new ways to plug the gushing leak after plans to cap it with a 100-ton containment box failed . \nThe company is trying another tactic , which involves plugging the leak with trash and , if that works , filling the well with mud and cement . \nMcKay said the first of two relief wells is being drilled and a second is to begin later this week Ahead of the testimony , lawmakers debated among themselves the impact of the spill on drilling . \nSen. Jeff Bingaman , D-N.M. , chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committe , said it is not enough `` to label this catastrophic failure an unpredictable and unforeseeable occurrence . '' \nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski , the panel 's top Republican , said it is essential to determine if the rig operators followed regulations and the law . \nBut she said the accident should not interfere in continued offshore oil development . \nThe morning hearing by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the afternoon session before the Environmental and Public Works Committee give lawmakers their first chance to question the executives publicly about the rig fire , attempts to stop the flow of oil and efforts to reduce the damage . \nBP and Transocean are also conducting separate investigations into what went wrong . \nBut while the environmental and economic damages have yet to unfold completely , Tuesday 's hearings could take on a showboating quality as recent hearings with executives from Toyota , in trouble for faulty braking systems , and Goldman Sachs , in trouble for fraud charges , offered more corporate condemnation than problem-solving . \n`` I hear one message -- do n't blame me , '' said Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyo . \n`` Shifting the blame game does n't get us very far . '' \n`` We are all in this together , '' Murkowski added , warning that without cooperation none of the companies will be in business . \nSeparately , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is proposing splitting up the Minerals Management Service . \nOne agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . \nA senior administration official told Fox News that legislation is not required for the change . \n`` DOI has the authority to implement changes '' by itself , the official said . \nThe administration 's outer-continental shelf drilling plan still can not technically be characterized as on hold , though Salazar is conducting a review of drilling safety . \nThe official left open the door for the drilling plan to be nixed , saying , `` Everything could be informed and impacted by the 30-day DOI review .

{"id": "245", "time": "2010-05-29", "text": "May 29 : This image made from video released by British Petroleum -LRB- BP PLC -RRB- shows the gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP ROBERT , Louisiana -- BP admitted defeat Saturday in its attempt to plug the Gulf of Mexico oil leak by pumping mud into a busted well , but is readying yet another approach after repeated failures to stop the crude that 's fouling marshland and beaches . \nBP PLC Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company determined the `` top kill '' had failed after it spent three days pumping heavy drilling mud into the crippled well 5,000 feet underwater . \nMore than 1.2 million gallons of mud was used , but most of it escaped out of the damaged riser . \nIn the six weeks since the spill began , the company has failed in each attempt to stop the gusher , as estimates of how much oil is leaking grow more dire . \nThe spill is the worst in U.S. history -- exceeding even the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster -- and dumping between 18 million and 40 million gallons into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \n`` This scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n't succeeded so far , '' Suttles said . \n`` Many of the things we 're trying have been done on the surface before , but have never been tried at 5,000 feet . '' \nThe company failed in the days after the spill to use robot submarines to close valves on the massive blowout preventer atop the damaged well , then two weeks later ice-like crystals clogged a 100-ton box the company tried placing over the leak . \nEarlier this week , engineers removed a mile-long siphon tube after it sucked up a disappointing 900,000 gallons of oil from the gusher . \nFrustration has grown as drifting oil closes beaches and washes up in sensitive marshland . \nThe damage is underscored by images of pelicans and their eggs coated in oil . \nBelow the surface , oyster beds and shrimp nurseries face certain death . \nPresident Barack Obama visited the coast Friday to see the damage as he tried to emphasize that his administration was in control of the crisis . \nHe told people in Grand Isle , where the beach has been closed by gobs of oil , that they would n't be abandoned . \nAfter BP announced the top kill failure , Obama said from Chicago that the continued flow of oil into the Gulf is `` as enraging as it is heartbreaking . '' \nSuttles said BP is already preparing for the next attempt to stop the leak that began after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 people . \nThe company plans to use robot submarines to cut off the damaged riser from which the oil is leaking , and then try to cap it with a containment valve . \nThe effort is expected to take between four and seven days . \n`` We 're confident the job will work but obviously we ca n't guarantee success , '' Suttles said of the new plan , declining to handicap the likelihood it will work . \nHe said that cutting off the damaged riser is n't expected to cause the flow rate of leaking oil to increase significantly . \nThe permanent solution to the leak , a relief well currently being drilled , wo n't be ready until August , BP says . \nExperts have said that a bend in the damaged riser likely was restricting the flow of oil somewhat , so slicing it off and installing a new containment valve is risky . \n`` If they ca n't get that valve on , things will get much worse , '' said Philip W. Johnson , an engineering professor at the University of Alabama . \nJohnson said he thinks BP can succeed with the valve , but added : `` It 's a scary proposition . '' \nWord that the top-kill had failed hit hard in fishing communities along Louisiana 's coast . \n`` Everybody 's starting to realize this summer 's lost . \nAnd our whole lifestyle might be lost , '' said Michael Ballay , the 59-year-old manager of the Cypress Cove Marina in Venice , Louisiana , near where oil first made landfall in large quanities almost two weeks ago . \nJohnny Nunez , owner of Fishing Magician Charters in Shell Beach , Louisiana , said the spill is hurting his business during what 's normally the best time of year -- and there 's no end in sight . \n`` If fishing 's bad for five years , I 'll be 60 years old . \nI 'll be done for , '' he said after watching BP 's televised announcement . \n"}
{"id": "745", "time": "2010-06-07", "text": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Nobody led . \nNot the president of the United States . \nNot the chief executive of BP . \nNot Congress , federal agencies or local elected officials . \nFrom its fiery beginning , the Gulf oil spill has stood as a concentrated reminder of why , over four decades , Americans have lost faith in nearly every national institution . \nLike Hurricane Katrina , a natural disaster that caused voters to question then-President George W. Bush 's credibility , the poisonous geyser at the Gulf 's floor threatens to undermine Barack Obama 's presidency . \nMore alarmingly , the spill exacerbates the worry that this nation founded on the principle of trust now faces a crisis of faith in its public and private institutions -- government and big business particularly . \n`` This spill , it 's another blow to the body politic , '' says John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Mass. . \nIt is , he says , another excuse to be cynical and uninvolved -- `` exactly the opposite of what has always been the American zeitgeist , a sense that we , collectively and through our institutions , can be something greater than ourselves . '' \nIt 's hard to summon that rising-sun aspiration when the unemployment rate hovers near double digits . \nWhen wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue unabated . \nWhen terrorists take aim from inside and outside U.S. borders . \nWhen the U.S. Treasury writes massive IOUs to China and public schools write off millions of poorly educated children . \nThen along comes the oil spill to remind people of why they do n't trust leaders -- and why so many Americans , looking for information and action , are turning instead to blogs , Twitter feeds and their friends . \nConsider this revealing scene : With reddish-brown oil globs washing ashore at Fort Morgan , Ala. , Faith Kaiser and Bertice McPherson decided to do what generations of Americans have done when government ca n't -- or wo n't -- tackle a big problem : They handled it themselves . \nBefore paid cleanup crews started work , the volunteers pulled on rubber gloves and picked up the gooey mess . \nAs they did so , Kaiser said this : `` Six months from now the government will lie to us and say everything is fine . '' \nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin famously observed that he had been trying to determine throughout the debate whether a sun painted on George Washington 's chair was rising or setting . \n`` But now at length , '' he said , `` I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun . '' \nAnd with that , the Founders created a nation upon the fundamental principle of trust . \nThey had an untested belief in the ability of people to lead themselves -- to choose leaders from their own ranks and to hold those leaders accountable . \nEven our currency , once backed by the promise of precious metal , is today built upon a faith-based system called `` fiat '' -- a Latin term meaning `` let it be done . '' \nIn a dictatorship , people can lose faith in institutions and the apparatus of state can step in . \nBut democracy ca n't survive without faith in its institutions because the people , by definition , create and control them . \nWhile there were surely crises of faith during the Civil War , the Progressive Era and others times of tumult , the early 20th century was marked by a reflexive sense of trust in the nation 's institutions . \nEven as Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal vastly expanded the government safety net , a new breed of private charities and social reformers did n't bother waiting on government to help the poor , infirm and abused . \nBut things started to change in the mid-20th century , when polls showed a steady decline on the question of whether Americans trusted government in Washington to do what is right . \nFrom 1958 , when more than 70 percent said they trusted government most or all of the time , the trend line steadily drops until it hits the mid-20s in the post-Watergate era . \nThe trust line creeps up for a few years -- without getting nowhere near the 1958 mark -- and plunges again in 1994 , the year President Bill Clinton 's political faltering caused Democrats to lose control of Congress after more than 40 years in power . \nJust two months ago , a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 22 percent of the public say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time , among the lowest measures in a half a century . \n`` This spill has just got to make matters worse , '' said Pew pollster Andy Kohut . \n`` People are asking , Who 's in charge ? \nWhy ca n't they plug it ? \nWhat going on here ? '' \nJust 25 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of Congress . \nFavorability ratings also have fallen significantly for seven of 13 federal agencies included in the Pew survey , including the Environmental Protection Agency . \nFaith in institutions across the board has fallen since the 1970s , at least among the sample of institutions tracked by Gallup : churches , the U.S. Supreme Court , banks , public schools , newspapers , Congress and organized labor . \nOne of the least-trusted institutions is big business , no surprise after corporate wrongdoing and lax government oversight combined to help create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . \nSixteen percent of Americans said they had a `` great deal '' or `` quite a lot '' of confidence in big corporations in 2009 , compared to 32 percent 30 years prior . \nThe only exception to this trend is the military , which has increased from a 54 percent favorability rating in the post-Vietnam era to 82 percent this year . \nPart of the problem : Americans today might expect too much of government and other institutions . \nTake the oil spill , for example . \nAccidents happen and , right or wrong , the government is not in the drilling or drill-capping business . \n`` I take responsibility . \nIt is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' Barack Obama declared a few days ago . \nIn the same news conference , Obama also acknowledged his administration could have done better in dealing with the biggest oil spill in the nation 's history and misjudged the industry 's ability to cope with a worst-case scenario . \nIt was a new twist for the U.S. presidency , an office normally filled by men who accept responsibility or admit fault only grudgingly . \nObama may be recognizing that accountability breeds trust . \nLess than two years removed from an election victory built on his promise to fix Washington 's broken institutions , Obama now seems a captive of them . \nHis administration 's regulators cozied up to the oil industry before the spill and moved slowly afterward to seize control . \nThe president himself often seemed detached . \nWho else dropped the ball ? \n-- BP and its chief executive , Tony Hayward . \nAs his company 's oil filled up the Gulf , he had the audacity to complain that `` I 'd like my life back . '' \n-- The Minerals Management Service , the regulatory agency that failed to clean up its act despite Obama 's promise during the campaign to end the `` cozy relationship '' between the oil industry and federal regulators . \n-- Even the Coast Guard -- the one agency that survived Katrina with its image enhanced -- is now being criticized for its lack of transparency and command . \nAnd the public stews . \nListen to Billy Nugesser , president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish : `` We are dying a slow death here . '' \nThe public 's unconditional faith in national institutions is dying , too . \nWe ca n't buy a `` Shrek '' drinking glass at McDonald 's because it might be laced with cadmium . \nWe ca n't talk about the Catholic church without wondering whether something untoward might be afoot . \nWe ca n't watch a home run without wondering if our pro-ballplayer heroes are juiced . \nWhich may be why an umpire 's blown call denying a rookie pitcher a historic `` perfect game '' became a viral story this week . \nAmericans saw in the umpire 's apology and the pitcher 's gracious acceptance a sign that one of their institutions -- the made-by-America game of baseball -- still includes leaders who do the right thing even when the situation is less than perfect . \nFrom their government , Americans do n't expect perfection . \nBut the system requires that people at least have faith in their political leaders to be competent and accountable . \n`` If people do n't believe , if people do n't give , if people do n't trust , they will pick the politicians who are the loudest rather than the most sincere , '' said Baick , the history professor . \n`` They will pick the rabble rouser rather than the technocrat who gets things done .

5,000 feet underwater . \nAP BP has launched a two-pronged attempt to plug the blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico using heavy mud and dense rubber balls , but the company 's CEO said it wo n't be clear for 48 hours whether the efforts will stop the massive oil spill . \nCEO Tony Hayward said in an interview Friday morning that the `` junk shot '' method -- which pumps rubber and other man-made material into the gushing well -- has been added to the `` top kill , '' which has been slowing the flow of oil by pumping mud into the source since Thursday . \nSpeaking on the same program , U.S. incident commander Thad Allen said the flow of oil and gas from the broken well has been stopped , but that the real test will be whether the stoppage can be sustained . \n`` The real challenge is to put enough mud into the well to keep the pressure where they can put a cement plug over the top , '' he said on ABC 's Good Morning America . \nThe next 12 to 18 hours will be `` very critical '' in the attempt to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Gulf , which is being overwhelmed by the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \nHayward said BP 's efforts have been going `` pretty well according to plan , '' and that the company planned to begin pumping more mud into the well again later today . \nPresident Obama arrived Friday in the Gulf , where he planned to tour a beach with Allen and visit with local officials . \nA day earlier , he acknowledged that his administration could have done a better job dealing with the spill and that it misjudged the industry 's ability to handle a worst-case scenario . \n`` I take responsibility . \nIt is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' he said . \nFriday 's trip was the president 's second to the coast since the BP-leased oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill . \nHe will be briefed in Grand Isle , La. , where the public beach has been closed since globs of oil started washing up a week ago . \nBuggie Vegas , who owns Bridge Side Cabins and Marina there , said Obama needs to see the disaster for himself . \n`` I think he 's going to get the message when he comes down and sees how bad it is , '' Vegas said . \nThe top kill is oil and gas giant BP PLC 's latest untested bid to end a spill that has , by the most conservative estimate , surpassed the Exxon Valdez disaster by gushing more than 18 million gallons into the Gulf . \nIt has worked on land but never been tried 5,000 feet underwater , and Hayward gave it a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . \nHe said Friday morning the top kill was progressing as planned and BP engineers had completed a second phase by pumping what he called `` loss prevention material '' into a crippled piece of equipment known as a blowout preventer to form a bridge against which crews could pump more heavyweight mud . \n`` Clearly I 'm as anxious as everyone in America is to get this thing done , '' Hayward said . \nIf the top kill fails , BP 's next best hope for controlling even part of the leak is a tinier version of something that has already been tried : a steel containment box to cap the well . \nA 100-ton box lies junked on the ocean floor , abandoned by BP after ice-like crystals clogged it . \nWhile BP officials say the smaller box should n't have that problem , it 's clearly not their preferred method . \nIt has been sitting in reserve on the seabed for more than a week while engineers first tried to siphon off oil through a mile-long tube . \nThat succeeded in collecting 924,000 gallons before crews took it out to allow room for the top kill attempt . \nIf the small box does n't work , BP officials say they will go back to the tube , crossing their fingers that a relief well still weeks away from being drilled far enough to affect the leak will help stop the bleeding . \nAnd even that 's not a sure bet . \nObama said Thursday that authorities insisted BP drill a second relief well as a backup since such wells often miss their mark . \nBP said in a regulatory filing Friday that it has spent $ 930 million so far responding to the ruptured well , including costs for cleanup and prevention work , drilling relief wells , and paying grants to Gulf states , damage claims and federal costs . \nBP says it 's too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated . \nTwo teams of scientists calculated the well has been spewing between 504,000 and more than a million gallons a day , which in the worst-case scenario means about 39 million gallons could have leaked . \nThe larger figure would be nearly four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster , in which a tanker ran aground in Alaska in 1989 , spilling nearly 11 million gallons . \nThe new Gulf spill estimates released Thursday were far higher than the 210,000 gallons that BP and the Coast Guard had guessed was pouring from the well . \nBut even the highest estimate would not make the spill the biggest ever in the Gulf . \nIn 1979 , a drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . \nThe Associated Press

Bush fielded for his frequent trips to Crawford , Texas , say Obama 's trip to Chicago over Memorial Day weekend is conspicuously poor in its timing . \nObama , who was headed to Chicago Thursday night , will not be at Arlington National Cemetery for the Memorial Day ceremony -- which he attended last year . \nInstead , the president plans to be at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood , Ill. , while Vice President Biden takes his place in Arlington for the wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . \nPete Hegseth , director of the conservative Vets for Freedom , said he does n't want to `` extrapolate too much , '' but questioned why a war-time president would not pencil in that ceremony . \n`` It does n't mean he does n't care , but I think it is a reflection of priorities , '' he said . \n`` We 're still at war ... and he 's not called out to the carpet on that . '' \nDana Perino , former Bush White House press secretary , called the decision a `` curious choice . '' \n`` I do think that symbolically that probably was not a very good choice , '' she told Fox News . \nThe Arlington visit is a fairly recent tradition . \nFormer President Ronald Reagan attended four of them in his eight years in office , while former President George H.W. Bush sent Vice President Dan Quayle to every one . \nFormer President Bill Clinton , though , attended every year and George W. Bush missed only one , in 2002 , when he was in Normandy , France , visiting the American cemetery . \nPhilip Molfese , a Chicago-based Democratic political consultant , said Obama will still be able to `` pay tribute '' at the Lincoln National Cemetery . \nAnd he dismissed the idea that Obama would somehow be stepping away from the oil spill crisis in the Gulf while in Chicago . \nThe president plans to visit the Gulf coast Friday before returning to the Windy City . \n`` He 's never really out of touch with what 's happening , '' said Molfese , president of the political firm Grainger Terry , Inc. `` These guys are never off the clock . \n... They 're constantly surrounded by people , they 're constantly getting updates . \nWhether they 're operating in Chicago or they 're operating in the White House , they 're still going to be getting constant communication . '' \nThe White House has tried to fend off suggestions that it has not acted forcefully enough to mitigate the damage from the oil spill -- Obama held a full-scale press conference Thursday afternoon where he spoke extensively about mitigation efforts . \nThe Obamas have not made an extensive visit to Chicago in more than a year and in a sense are trying to make good on prior pledges to visit their home town more often . \nBut critics point out that the trip is their second since the Gulf oil rig exploded April 20 -- the first family traveled to Asheville , N.C. , that weekend . \n"}

{"id": "1990", "time": "2010-06-01", "text": "Massive Oil Spill Washes Ashore in the Gulf Millions of gallons of oil have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from a blown-out well at the site of the Deepwater Horizon , which exploded on April 20 and sank two days later . \nNEW ORLEANS -- BP 's stock plummeted and took much of the market down with it Tuesday as the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nBP engineers , meanwhile , tried to recover from a failed attempt to stop the gusher with an effort that will initially make the leak worse . \nAttorney General Eric Holder , who was visiting the Gulf to survey the fragile coastline and meet with state and federal prosecutors , would not say who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \n`` We will closely examine the actions of those involved in the spill . \nIf we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said in New Orleans . \nBP 's stock nose-dived on Tuesday , losing nearly 15 percent of its value on the first trading day since the previous best option -- the so-called `` top kill '' -- failed and was aborted at the government 's direction . \nIt dipped steeply with Holder 's late-afternoon announcement , which also sent other energy stocks tumbling , ultimately causing the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 112 . \nAfter six weeks of failures to block the well or divert the oil , BP was using robotic machines to carve into the twisted appendages of the crippled well . \nThe latest attempt involved using tools resembling an oversized deli slicer and garden shears to break away the broken riser pipe so engineers can then position a cap over the well 's opening . \nEven if it succeeds , it will temporarily increase the flow of an already massive leak by 20 percent -- at least 100,000 gallons more a day . \nAnd it is far from certain that BP will be able to cap a well that one expert compared to an out-of-control fire hydrant . \n`` It is an engineer 's nightmare , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences . \n`` They 're trying to fit a 21-inch cap over a 20-inch pipe a mile away . \nThat 's just horrendously hard to do . \nIt 's not like you and I standing on the ground pushing -- they 're using little robots to do this . '' \nThe operation has never been performed in such deep water , and is similar to an earlier failed attempt that used a larger cap that quickly froze up . \nBP PLC officials said they were applying lessons learned from the earlier effort , and plan to pump warm water through pipes into the smaller dome to prevent any icing problems . \n`` If all goes as planned , within about 24 hours we could have this contained , '' BP 's Doug Suttles said Tuesday after touring a temporary housing facility set up for cleanup workers in Grand Isle . \n`` But we ca n't guarantee success . '' \nSince the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and eventually collapsing into the Gulf of Mexico , an estimated 20 million to 40 million gallons of oil has spewed , eclipsing the 11 million that leaked from the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nOil has fouled many fishing areas and miles of ecologically sensitive coastline . \nMississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said oil from the spill was found in his state for the first time , on a barrier island , and newly expanded federal restrictions mean that nearly a third of federal waters are closed to fishing . \nPresident Barack Obama on Tuesday ordered the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster , `` to follow the facts wherever they lead , without fear or favor . '' \nThe commission is led by Bob Graham , a former Florida governor and U.S. senator , and William K. Reilly , a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency . \nHolder said the laws under review for the criminal and civil probes include the Clean Water Act , the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act . \nHe said the government would pursue criminal charges `` if warranted , '' a caveat he did not include for civil action . \n`` We will ensure that every cent , every cent of taxpayer money , will be repaid and that damage to the environment and wildlife will be reimbursed , '' he said . \nWashington lawyer Stan Brand said that two likely criminal law theories the Justice Department would pursue are false statements to the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service and obstruction by failing to produce evidence to investigators . \nBut Brand and longtime Washington lawyer Stephen Ryan , a former federal prosecutor and ex-congressional investigator , predicted it will be difficult to prove criminality . \n`` Bad business judgment is n't a crime , '' said Ryan . \nBP is part owner of the blown well . \nOther companies involved include rig operator Transocean ; oil services company Halliburton , which handled the cementing of the well ; and Cameron Inc. , which made the blowout preventer that apparently failed . \nCriminal charges have met with mixed results in two previous high-profile U.S. oil spills . \nJoseph Hazelwood , captain of the Exxon Valdez supertanker that ran aground off Alaska 's coast in 1989 , was acquitted of being drunk when the accident occurred , but convicted of a misdemeanor for negligent oil discharge . \nHe was fined $ 50,000 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service . \nHong Kong-based Fleet Management Ltd. paid a $ 10 million fine after pleading 1\\/4 to obstruction charges following a 2007 oil spill after one of the company 's cargo ships struck the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge . \nThe ship 's pilot pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and was sentenced to 10 months in prison . \nThe government would have a lower burden of proof in a civil case . \nIn the Valdez spill , thousands of fishermen , cannery workers , landowners and Native Americans were initially awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages , but the amount was eventually reduced to $ 507.5 million . \nBP is part owner of the blown well . \nOther companies involved include rig operator Transocean ; oil services company Halliburton , which handled the cementing of the well ; and Cameron Inc. , which made the blowout preventer that apparently failed . \nBP engineers began putting underwater robots and equipment in place this week after an attempt to plug the well by force-feeding it heavy mud and cement -- called a `` top kill '' -- was aborted over the weekend . \nCrews pumped thousands of gallons of the mud into the well but were unable to overcome the pressure of the oil . \nThe next plan has BP engineers placing a cap-like containment valve over the well . \nNot all the gushing oil will be captured through the `` cut and cap '' method , but the company said it could siphon most of the crude to a vessel on the surface . \nEric Smith , an associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute , likened the procedure to trying to place a tiny cap on a fire hydrant that 's blowing straight up . \nCrews have forged two different caps in case one of them does n't work . \nBefore it can place either one , the company plans to cut the riser in two different places , keeping it aloft with a crane so it does n't collapse . \nGigantic shears will cleave off the far end of the riser while a diamond cutter , lowered on top of the blowout preventer early Tuesday , will try to make an even cut through the other end of the tube . \nA clean cut from the diamond cutter , which resembles a deli slicer , is important because engineers will then lower a heavy cap on top of the sheared-off tube to seal the leak . \nBP 's best chance to actually plug the leak rests with a pair of relief wells that likely wo n't be completed until August . \n"}

Thad Allen , said Thursday that the mud was stopping some oil and gas but had a ways to go before it proved successful . \nThe top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . \n`` As you inject your mud into it , it is going to stop some hydrocarbons , '' Russell said . \n`` That does n't mean it 's successful . '' \nBP spokesman Tom Mueller also discounted news reports that the top kill had worked . \n`` We appreciate the optimism , but the top kill operation is continuing through the day today -- that has n't changed , '' he said Thursday morning . \n`` We do n't anticipate being able to say anything definitive on that until later today . '' \nOil is coating birds and delicate wetlands along the Louisiana coast , and the political fallout from the spill has reached all the way to Washington , where the head of the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling resigned Thursday . \nMinerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum stepped down just hours before a planned White House press conference where President Barack Obama was expected to extend a moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling . \nBirnbaum and her agency came under withering criticism from lawmakers of both parties over lax oversight of drilling and cozy ties with industry . \nAn internal Interior Department report released earlier this week found that between 2000 and 2008 , agency staff members accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography . \nBirnbaum had run the service since July 2009 . \nAfter receiving the results of a 30-day safety review from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Obama also planned to delay controversial lease sales off the coast of Alaska and cancel entirely plans for drilling lease sales in the Western Gulf and off the coast of Virginia , according to a White House aide . \nPolls show the public is souring on the administration 's handling of the catastrophe , and fishermen , hotel and restaurant owners , politicians and residents along the 100-mile stretch of Gulf coast affected by the spill are fed up with BP 's failures to stop the oil . \n`` I have anxiety attacks , '' said Sarah Rigaud , owner of Sarah 's Restaurant in Grand Isle , La. , where the public beach was closed because blobs of oil that looked like melted chocolate had washed up on shore . \n`` Every day I pray that something happens , that it will be stopped and everybody can get back to normal . '' \nThe Coast Guard pulled commercial fishing boats from oil cleanup efforts in Breton Sound off the Louisiana coast on Wednesday after several people became ill . \nCrew members on three vessels reported nausea , dizziness , headaches and chest pains , the Coast Guard said . \nFour people were hospitalized , including one who was flown to a hospital . \nIf the top kill fails , BP says it has several backup plans , including sealing the well 's blowout preventer with a smaller cap , which would contain the oil . \nAn earlier attempt to cap the blowout preventer failed . \nBP could also try a `` junk shot '' -- shooting golf balls and other debris into the blowout preventer to clog it up -- during the top kill process . \nThe only permanent solution is drilling a second well , but that will take a couple of months . \nBP plans to go ahead with that even if the top kill works . \nBorenstein reported from Washington . \nBen Nuckols in Covington , La. , and Andrew Taylor and Matthew Daly in Washington contributed to this report . \n"}

Thad Allen said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' that the spill , which is ravaging beaches and wildlife , will not be contained until the leak is fully plugged and that even afterward `` there will be oil out there for months to come . '' \nThe disaster , which began with an oil rig explosion in mid-April , will persist `` well into the fall , '' Allen said . \nA containment cap placed on the gusher near the sea floor trapped about 441,000 gallons of oil Saturday , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said , up from around 250,000 gallons of oil Friday . \nIt 's not clear how much is still escaping ; an estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons of crude is believed to be leaking daily . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward told the BBC on Sunday that he believed the cap was likely to capture `` the majority , probably the vast majority '' of the oil gushing from the well . \nThe gradual increase in the amount being captured is deliberate , in an effort to prevent water from getting inside and forming a frozen slush that foiled a previous containment attempt . \nThe next step is for BP engineers to attempt to close vents on the cap that allow streams of oil to escape and prevent that water intake , and Hayward told the BBC that the company hopes a second containment system will be in place by next weekend . \nAllen told CBS that the oil would stop flowing only when the leak was plugged with cement . \nHawyard , who has faced criticism over his company 's response to the spill , told the BBC that he would n't step down and that he had the `` absolute intention of seeing this through to the end . '' \n`` We 're going to clean up the oil , we 're going to remediate any environmental damage and we are going to return the Gulf coast to the position it was in prior to this event , '' he told the BBC . \nAllen took issue on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday with BP officials who said they were pleased with results of the latest effort . \nHe said progress was being made , `` but I do n't think anybody should be pleased as long as there is oil in the water . '' \nHe said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that he does n't `` want to create any undue encouragement '' and that `` we need to underpromise and overdeliver . '' \nWhile BP plans to eventually use an additional set of hoses and pipes to increase the amount of oil being trapped , the ultimate solution remains a relief well that should be finished by August . \nThe urgency of that task was apparent along the Gulf Coast nearly seven weeks after the BP rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and rupturing the wellhead a mile below the surface . \nSince then , millions of gallons of oil have been rising to the surface and spreading out across the sea . \nThe oil is coating and miring waterfowl in the sticky mess , and dead birds and dolphins are washing ashore . \nScientists say the wildlife death toll remains relatively modest , though , because the Deepwater Horizon rig was 50 miles off the coast and most of the oil has stayed in the open sea . \nThe oil has steadily spread east , washing up in greater quantities in recent days . \nSmall tar balls have washed up as far east as Fort Walton Beach , about a third of the way across the Florida Panhandle . \nGovernment officials estimate that roughly 23 million to 49 million gallons have leaked into the Gulf . \nA line of oil mixed with seaweed stretched all across the beach Sunday morning in Gulf Shores , Ala. . \nThe oil was often hidden beneath the washed-up plants . \nAt a cleaning station outside a huge condominium tower , Leon Baum scrubbed oil off his feet with Dawn dishwashing detergent . \nBaum had driven with his children and grandchildren from Bebee , Ark. , for their annual vacation on Alabama 's coast . \nThey had contemplated leaving because of the oil , but they 've already spent hundreds of dollars on their getaway . \n`` After you drive all this way , you stay , '' Baum said . \nAt Pensacola Beach , Buck Langston and his family took to collecting globs of tar instead of sea shells on Sunday morning . \nThey used improvised chopsticks to pick up the balls and drop them into plastic containers . \nUltimately , the hoped to help clean it all up , Langston said . \n`` Yesterday it was n't like this , this heavy , '' Langston said . \n`` I do n't know why cleanup crews are n't out here .

'' \nBP has estimated about 5,000 barrels a day , or 210,000 gallons a day , has been leaking out . \nSuttles said they hope to be able to collect more oil as they ramp up the effort but they wo n't be able to get all of it . \nIn a major step toward containing the massive oil leak , BP PLC crews on Sunday hooked up the tube to funnel the crude into a tanker ship . \nHowever , millions of gallons of crude are already in the Gulf . \nThe contraption was hooked up successfully and sucking oil from a pipe at the blown well Sunday afternoon after being hindered by several setbacks . \nEngineers remotely guiding robot submersibles had worked since Friday to place the tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-centimeter -RRB- pipe nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the sea . \nKent Wells , BP 's senior vice president for exploration and production , said during a news conference that the amount being drawn was gradually increasing , and it would take several days to measure it . \nCompany spokesman Mark Proegler at the joint spill command center in Louisiana had initially said the tube was containing most of the oil coming from the pipe , which is contributing an estimated 85 percent of the crude in the spill . \nIn a statement Sunday , BP said that the tube was `` successfully tested and inserted into the leaking riser , capturing some amounts of oil and gas . '' \n`` While not collecting all of the leaking oil , this tool is an important step in reducing the amount of oil being released into Gulf waters , '' BP said . \nPrevious attempts to use emergency valves and a 100-ton container had failed to stop the leak that has spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , threatening sea life , commercial fishing and the coastal tourism industry from Louisiana to Florida . \nBP PLC has also been burning small amounts of floating oil and spraying chemical dispersants above and below the surface . \nThe tube 's success gave crews partial control of the leak for the first time in more than three weeks . \nOil has been spewing since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 people and sinking two days later . \nThe government shortly afterward estimated the spill at 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 liters -RRB- -- or 5,000 barrels -- a day , a figure that has since been questioned by some scientists who fear it could be far more . \nBP executives have stood by the estimate while acknowledging there 's no way to know for sure . \nResearchers warned Sunday that miles-long -LRB- kilometers-long -RRB- underwater plumes of oil from the spill could poison and suffocate sea life across the food chain , with damage that could endure for a decade or more . \nResearchers have found more underwater plumes of oil than they can count from the blown-out well , said Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia . \nShe said careful measurements taken of one plume showed it stretching for 10 miles -LRB- 16 kilometers -RRB- , with a 3-mile -LRB- 5-kilometer -RRB- width . \nThe hazardous effects of the plume are twofold . \nJoye said the oil itself can prove toxic to fish swimming in the sea , while vast amount of oxygen are also being sucked from the water by microbes that eat oil . \nDispersants used to fight the oil are also food for the microbes , speeding up the oxygen depletion . \n`` So , first you have oily water that may be toxic to certain organisms and also the oxygen issue , so there are two problems here , '' said Joye , who 's working with a group of scientists who discovered the underwater plumes in a recent boat expedition to the Gulf . \n`` This can interrupt the food chain at the lowest level , and will trickle up and certainly impact organisms higher . \nWhales , dolphins and tuna all depend on lower depths to survive . '' \nShe said it could take years or even decades for the ecosystem to recover . \nBP has been casting about for ways to contain the leak since it was discovered several days after the blast . \nFirst robot submarines were unable to get valves to work on machinery at the well head called the blowout preventer . \nThen the company failed to capture the oil with a 100-ton box after icelike crystals formed in it . \nA relief well , considered the permanent solution the leak , is still being drilled and is months away from completion . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}

Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . \n, and seven other senators asked the Justice Department to determine whether BP PLC made false and misleading claims to the government about its ability to prevent a serious oil spill when it applied for permission last year to drill the Deepwater Horizon well that has unleashed environmental havoc along the Gulf coast . \nBut lawmakers are taking aim not only at BP at hearings this week , but also the Interior Department 's regulation of offshore drilling that allowed BP to operate without assurance a massive spill could be prevented . \nAnticipating tough questioning on Capitol Hill at hearings this week , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Monday announced a tightening of requirements for onshore oil and gas drilling . \nThe new measures would not apply to oil rigs at sea . \n`` The BP oil spill is a stark reminder of how we must continue to push ahead with the reforms we have been working on and which we know are needed , '' Salazar said . \nOynes is the first person to resign at his agency since an April 20 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sunk the rig and caused the massive oil spill . \nThe spill continues to grow as oil officials and federal authorities race to stop the flow and protect the coast . \nRep.

Thad Allen said Friday the mud was able to push down the oil and gas coming up at great force from underground , but had not overwhelmed the gusher or stopped the flow . \nPresident Barack Obama arrived on the Gulf Coast to tell residents they are not alone in dealing with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nHe inspected a fouled beach and pledged that the government would `` keep at it '' until the spill that has become the worst in U.S. history is stopped and cleaned up . \nHe also had a message for Gulf residents . \n`` I 'm here to tell you that you are not alone , you will not be abandoned , you will not be left behind , '' he said . \n`` The media may get tired of the story , but we will not . \nWe will be on your side and we will see this through . '' \nFriday 's trip was the president 's second to the coast since the BP-leased oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill . \nBP said in a regulatory filing Friday that it has spent $ 930 million so far responding to the ruptured well , including costs for cleanup and prevention work , drilling relief wells , and paying grants to Gulf states , damage claims and federal costs . \nBP says it 's too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities . \nAs Americans grow more outraged by the spill , and frustrated at the fumbling efforts to stop it , President Barack Obama announced new steps to restrict drilling , including the suspension of planned exploratory drilling off the coasts of Alaska and Virginia and ordering a halt to 33 exploratory deep-water rigs in the Gulf of Mexico . \nFrom the Arctic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay , the decision announced Thursday is stirring passions on both sides of the issue . \nSome politicians , especially in Virginia where lease sales scheduled for 2012 were canceled , are accusing Obama of a `` knee-jerk '' reaction that could bring to a halt to their expected economic boon from drilling . \nBut many who make their living from Virginia 's waters say Obama is right to tread carefully in the wake of the devastation in the Gulf . \nPresident Barack Obama says he is ordering an increase in manpower in the Gulf Coast to deal with the massive oil spill . \nObama says he will triple the manpower in places where oil has already hit the shore or is within 24 hours of doing so . \nThe president says the increase will help contain the spill more quickly and minimize the amount of time oil is on the coastline . \nSince last month 's rig explosion and spill of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , more than 3 million feet of so-called boom has been deployed along the coast . \nBut it 's not a fail-safe method of keeping the oil from washing ashore . \nIt 's not always sturdy enough and high winds and waves can send the slime cascading over the barriers . \nThe key line of defense is sometimes defenseless itself against the elements . \n`` Even if it 's working properly , the best it will do is move the problem somewhere else , '' said Doug Helton , incident operations coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Emergency Response Division . \nA thick , 22-mile plume of oil discovered by researchers off the BP spill site was nearing an underwater canyon , where it could poison the food chain for sea life in the waters off Florida . \nThe discovery by researchers on the University of South Florida College of Marine Science 's Weatherbird II vessel is the second significant undersea plume reported since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 . \nThe plume is more than 6 miles wide and its presence was reported Thursday . \nThe cloud was nearing a large underwater canyon whose currents fuel the food chain in Gulf waters off Florida and could potentially wash the tiny plants and animals that feed larger organisms in a stew of toxic chemicals , another researcher said Friday . \nAn annual list of top 10 beaches released Friday includes two in Florida . \nThe list 's creator says he 's not worried about pollution from the oil spill . \nDr. Stephen Leatherman , director of Florida International University 's Laboratory for Coastal Research , who is also known by the nickname Dr. Beach , included Siesta Beach in Sarasota and Cape Florida State Park in Key Biscayne , on his list of best beaches . \nHe said Cape Florida , on the southeast coast , `` does n't get the wave activity '' that can lead to tar balls washing up . \nAs for Siesta Beach , he said he had looked at currents and believes `` there 's very low probability the oil will get to southwest Florida .

'' \nThe chief executive for Swiss-based Transocean , which owned the oil rig and the blowout preventer , shifted blame to BP . \n`` All offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' CEO Steven Newman said in his Senate testimony , also obtained by the AP . \nNewman said BP was responsible for submitting a detailed plan specifying where and how a well is to be drilled , cased , cemented and completed . \nNewman also said BP 's contractor , Halliburton Inc. , was responsible for encasing the well in cement , putting a temporary plug in the top of the well and ensuring the cement 's integrity . \nThat cementing process was dictated by BP 's well plan , Newman said . \nA Halliburton executive , Tim Probert , said the company safely finished a cementing operation 20 hours before the rig went up in flames . \nProbert said Halliburton completed work on the well according to accepted industry practice and at the direction of federal regulators . \nThe blame-game took hold on Capitol Hill as Congress and federal investigators were to begin a series of hearings in Washington and on the Gulf Coast . \nTwo Senate hearings were set for Tuesday , and a House hearing was scheduled for Wednesday . \nIn Louisiana , near the disaster site , a six-member panel that includes investigators from the Interior Department and Coast Guard was to begin two days of hearings . \nMcKay , the BP executive , said the company wants answers itself . \nHe disclosed that the company has at least 40 people internally investigating the accident , but he acknowledged that the cause is still a mystery . \nTransocean has its own investigative team , Newman said . \n`` We are looking at our own actions and those of our contractors , '' McKay wrote in his Senate testimony . \nNewman said it makes no sense to suggest the blowout preventer caused the accident . \nHe said it was ironic that attention was being focused on the blowout preventer because at the time of the explosion drilling at the site was finished . \nThe blowout preventer , made by Houston-based Cameron Inc. , is a 450-ton piece of equipment that sits on top of the wellhead during drilling operations . \nIt contains valves that can be closed remotely in case of an accident or increase in pressure . \n`` The systems are intended to be fail-safe ; sadly and for reasons we do not yet understand , in this case , they were not , '' McKay said . \nThe cause of the explosion is under investigation , but lawsuits filed after the disaster have alleged it occurred when Halliburton workers improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . \nAccording to a 2007 study by the Minerals Management Service , an agency within the Interior Department , cementing was a factor in 18 of 39 rig blowouts in the gulf between 1992 and 2006 . \nProbert of Halliburton said the company had four workers stationed on the rig performing several tasks , including cementing -- a process of applying cement and water to a pipe to prevent the wall of the hole from collapsing during drilling . \nA positive pressure test was conducted after the work was finished to demonstrate the integrity of the cement job , Probert said . \nTransocean , the well owner , decided to continue operating the well after the cement job was completed , he said . \nProbert said a `` negative '' pressure test , which measures the integrity of the casing seal assembly , was conducted by BP at the direction of Transocean and according to requirements of the Minerals Management Service . \nAfter the test was completed , BP `` then continued to displace the riser with seawater before the planned placement of the final cement plug , which would have been installed inside the production string and enabled the planned temporary abandonment of the well , '' Probert said . \nBefore Halliburton personnel could set the final cement plug , the explosion occurred . \n`` As a result , the final cement plug was never set , '' Probert said . \nDavid Nagel , a senior vice president and head of BP America 's Washington office , emphasized in a meeting with reporters Monday that the company is making every effort to find a way to halt the spill , pay for cleanup and address claims from people that are being harmed -- a theme that will be repeated by BP executives to senators . \n`` We want to do the right thing , '' Nagel said . \nAssociated Press writers H.

{"id": "2017", "time": "2010-06-08", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- While BP is capturing more oil from its blown-out well with every passing day , scientists on a team analyzing the flow said Tuesday that the amount of crude still escaping into the Gulf of Mexico is considerably greater than what the government and the company have claimed . \nTheir assertions -- combined with BP 's rush to build a bigger cap and its apparent difficulty in immediately processing all the oil being collected -- have only added to the impression that BP and the government are still floundering in dealing with the catastrophe and may be misleading the public . \nThe cap that was put on the ruptured well last week collected about 620,000 gallons -LRB- 2.3 million liters -RRB- of oil on Monday and another 330,000 gallons -LRB- 1.25 million liters -RRB- by noon Tuesday , funneling it to a ship at the surface , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \nThat would mean the cap is capturing better than half of the oil , based on the government 's estimate that around 600,000 gallons -LRB- 2.25 million liters -RRB- to 1.2 million gallons -LRB- 4.5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . \nThe undersea efforts came as BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles struck an upbeat tone about the anticipated progress of the oil containment , saying that the spill `` should be down to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday . '' \nSuttles told The Associated Press in a stop in Alabama that the arrival of a second vessel in the coming days to help pump the oil from the deepwater gusher will allow engineers to make significant progress , even as others involved in the disaster were much less optimistic and continued to criticize BP over its litany of failures to control the spill . \nA team of researchers and government officials assembled by the Coast Guard and run by the director of the U.S. Geological Survey is studying the flow rate and hopes to present its latest findings in the coming days on what is already the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . \nIn an interview with The Associated Press , team member and Purdue University engineering professor Steve Wereley said it was a `` reasonable conclusion '' but not the team 's final one to say that the daily flow rate is , in fact , somewhere between 798,000 gallons -LRB- 3 million liters -RRB- and 1.8 million gallons -LRB- 6.8 million liters -RRB- . \n`` BP is claiming they 're capturing the majority of the flow , which I think is going to be proven wrong in short order , '' Wereley said . \n`` Why do n't they show the American public the before-and-after shots ? '' \nHe added : `` It 's strictly an estimation , and they are portraying it as fact . '' \nTo install the device snugly , BP engineers had to cut away the twisted and broken well pipe . \nThat increased the flow of oil , similar to what happens when a kink is removed from a garden hose . \nBP and others warned that would happen . \nThe government said the increase amounted to about 20 percent . \nAsked about the containment effort and the uncertainties in estimating how much oil is escaping , Allen said : `` I have never said this is going well . \nWe 're throwing everything we 've got . '' \nPaul Bommer , a University of Texas petroleum and geosystems engineering professor and member of the flow rate team , said cap seems to have made a `` dent '' in reducing the flow , but there is still a lot of oil coming out . \nThat seemed clear from the underwater `` spillcam '' video , which continued to show a big plume of gas and oil billowing into the water . \nThe current equipment collecting the oil being brought to the surface is believed to be nearing its daily processing capacity . \nBP said it will boost capacity by bringing in a floating platform it believes can process most of the flow , and believes the extra pumping power can help reduce the spill by early next week , when President Barack Obama is scheduled to make his fourth visit to the Gulf since the disaster began . \nThe company also said it will use a device that vaporizes and burns off oil while working to design a new cap that can capture more crude . \nAt the same time , BP is working to design a new cap that can capture more oil . \nIn the seven weeks since the oil rig explosion that set off the catastrophe , BP has had to improvise at every turn . \nThe most recent government estimates put the total amount of oil lost at 23.7 million to 51.5 million gallons . \n`` I think virtually everybody from BP to the state to the Coast Guard was caught flat-footed and did not expect a spill of this magnitude , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . \n`` Everybody has been playing catch-up . '' \nWhen asked why BP did not have containment systems on standby in case of a leak , BP spokesman Robert Wine said there was no reason to think an accident on this scale was likely . \n`` It 's unprecedented , '' he said . \n`` That 's why these caps were n't there before . '' \nKenneth Arnold , an offshore drilling consultant and engineer , said the reason a bigger cap was n't installed first was that BP probably wanted to start with what it could do quickly , which he said makes sense . \nHe said BP has been working several solutions all along in parallel and deploying them as they can . \n`` They have n't been waiting for one to fail and then employing the next one , '' Arnold said . \nHe added : `` The idea you can wave your arm at this and come to a magical solution is just from someone who does n't understand the problem . \nWe as a nation are used to instant gratification . \nThere is a problem . \nWe want someone to fix it tomorrow . \nThings are not always that easy . '' \nSome answers may emerge next week , when BP CEO Tony Hayward will make his first appearance before Congress to answer questions in what will probably be a heated session , given the anger directed at BP . \nThe debate over the flow rate came as workers in bulldozers piled sand 6 feet -LRB- 1.83 meters -RRB- high along barrier islands bordering Louisiana to protect the environmentally fragile areas from the spill , which has already coated islands and pelican rookeries in thick , brown , sticky crude . \n`` This is finally something that can help , '' fishing guide Dave Marino said of the sand barrier effort . \n`` It looks like this is something that may work . '' \nAttempts to skim the oil progressed as well . \nBoats fanned out across the Gulf , dragging boom in their wake in an attempt to corral the oil . \nBut it 's an enormous task . \nIn some spots , the oil is several inches thick -LRB- centimeters -RRB- and forms a brown taffy-like goo that sticks to everything it touches . \nJohn Young , chairman of Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish Council , said additional equipment has been ordered and more dredgers will be moving into the area soon , along with barges that will help block the passes . \n`` It 's nice that BP has put up the money , but they need to ramp up not only the manpower but the equipment out there because we 're losing the battle , '' Young said . \n`` Unfortunately , we 're on day 50 and it 's too little too late , but I guess it 's better late than never . '' \nMeanwhile , researchers are beginning to obtain a clearer picture of the spill as they analyze water samples . \nFor example , marine scientists found a 100-foot -LRB- 30-meter -RRB- - thick layer of oil 1,300 feet -LRB- 390 meters -RRB- below the surface about 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- from the well site . \nAnd officials in the Florida Panhandle are posting signs warning beachgoers not to swim or fish off a six-mile -LRB- 10-kilometer -RRB- stretch of oil-fouled beaches near the Alabama state line -- the first time such restrictions have been imposed in the state since the spill began . \n"}

'' \nBaldwin County officials deny that anyone ever told Hinton such a thing . \nBut whatever happened , Jamie Hinton was fired up . \nHinton and other leaders got together to kick around ideas for safeguarding their river shortly after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in about 5,000 feet of water off the Louisiana coast . \nSomeone suggested using barges at the mouth of Weeks Bay to block waves out of the adjoining Mobile Bay , then adding layers of boom . \n`` It 's not rocket science , but it sounded like it might work , '' Hinton said . \nThe engineering did n't seem that hard since the passage into Weeks Bay is only about 530 feet wide and fairly shallow . \n`` That protects the Fish River and the Magnolia River . \nI thought , ` that 's awesome , ' '' he said . \nCommunity members honed the plan , and Hinton set out to find barriers to supplement the single strand of narrow boom that BP provided , a meager allocation Hinton called `` overly ridiculous . '' \nHe submitted the blueprint in mid-May believing he 'd get an answer quickly from the unified incident command in Mobile . \nAnd then , with the oil oozing toward the northern Gulf Coast , Hinton waited . \nAfter fits and starts , supposed approvals and later balks , Hinton finally got the OK last week on his fourth try to protect the river just as oil began washing ashore on Alabama beaches . \nWith a $ 200,000 allocation from the $ 25 million that BP gave Alabama for oil spill response , rented barges , a tug and other barriers are now in the water . \nSo far , no oil is in Weeks Bay or either river , but the slick has n't gotten to the barrier yet . \nIf and when it does , Hinton and the mayor will make the decision to close the bay and block off access to the Magnolia River . \n`` We can shut it down in three hours , '' Hinton said . \nWhy did it take so long for Hinton to get an answer about the protection plan ? \nScott Hughes , a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Environmental Management , said the delay sounded like an issue for the unified command in Mobile to address . \nThe head of the command , Coast Guard Capt. Steve Poulin , said it sounded like an issue related to the state 's approval process . \nHixon , Hinton 's buddy , said the whole system is broken . \n`` This is the biggest damn mess I 've ever seen , '' he said . \nPatricia Sevening , a member of the Magnolia Springs Garden Club who lives on a canal off the Fish River , is just happy someone is protecting her water . \n"}

\nDARRYL CARPENTER , CW ROBERTS CONTRACTING : We got a couple of guys here that 's going to demonstrate first while I kind of explain what we 're doing . \nWe got George Roberts and Otis Goodson . \nWe 're going to put some oil in the water . \nWe actually have seawater from the Gulf of Mexico that we brought in and this is actually some crude oil from an oil well in Alabama . \nSo we 're actually doing what would actually be out there in the ocean . \nGeorge is going to take some hay , regular old hay like you have on the farm . \nPut it on top of the oil and it will actually absorb the oil up . \nOtis has got some polyester reinforced fabric . \nThis stuff works great . \nIt actually does better -- almost immediately it will absorb the oil up . \nSo there 's two different products we 've been working with the hay and we 've -- in that timeframe we 've actually found some more products that work , too . \nAnd -- so we want to show a little bit of every one of it . \nBut we 've not had any response on any of our products . \nHANNITY : Well , can I just -- CARPENTER : And we do n't -- we do n't know why . \nHANNITY : Can you ask one of your demonstrators there if it 's possible , turn it over ? \nBecause what you do is you lay this on the surface , obviously , of the ocean and then you 'd just scoop up the hay -- HANNITY : -- and along with the hay you 're getting -- what percentage of the oil would you get ? \nCARPENTER : You can see right there . \nWe can 95 percent of it right there . \nYou can see how much is on the hay right there now . \nCARPENTER : Just with that little bit . \nAnd it just sucks it right up . \nHANNITY : And nobody is listening to your idea even though this has become an Internet sensation ? \nNobody 's -- nobody reaching out to you ? \nCARPENTER : Nobody is -- look how clean the water is . \nNobody is reaching out to us . \nLook at the clean the water is right there . \nCARPENTER : If it was n't saltwater you could drink it . \nHonestly , look at that . \nIt 's clean as -- that is a great demonstration . \nAll right , well -- HANNITY : I appreciate that . \nAll right , let 's bring in Nick Pozzi . \nNick , welcome to the program . \nNow you are a -- NICHOLAS POZZI , ENGINEER : Thank you . \nHANNITY : You 're a contractor . \nAnd you came up with a pretty interesting idea to suck the crude off the water 's surface . \nLet 's go to your idea and tell us what you 've got . \nPOZZI : First of all , I want to say that hay sucks up -- just so you know -- 80 percent of its weight in oil so it 's very , very effective . \nIt 's usually -- was used all over the world . \nIt 's been used for years and years and years . \nIt is nature 's most effective way and safe way to pick up oil . \nThat 's number one . \nNumber two is the fact that I 'm actually the chairman of WOW Environmental Solutions . \nAnd -- but I 've been a contractor , worked in Saudi Arabia for 18 years where we had , unfortunately , a lot of oil spills . \nAnd through lessons learned we developed ways to clean up oil everywhere , including at all level , all depths through different currents that hand off each other , to basically supply oxygenated water as well as nutrients to oyster beds and shrimp and so on and so forth in the Gulf of Arabia . \nHANNITY : All right , Nick -- HANNITY : Let me just -- because we only limited on time here . \nAnd you guys have three great ideas . \nHANNITY : So in other words , regardless of currents , regardless of depth you have been able to basically -- you have techniques that can suck up this oil . \nSo in other words , if we would have started using that 10 days into the spill the chances of this reaching shore in the quantities that we 're going to be looking at here are negligible . \nAnd again , I ask you , did anybody from the government , BP , anyone reach out to you ? \nPOZZI : No , we 've actually shared this idea on day two of the oil spill . \nPOZZI : Went down to home and to BP headquarters and basically we could not get an audience . \nWe have sent them over and over again information and they basically said it 's not an applicable for this particular spill . \nAnd I 've challenged them to an actual open debate about it and to tell me why it 's not effective and to demonstrate how it is effective . \nAnd I have not received any response back . \nEverybody seems to be looking at it but no one seems to be doing anything . \nHANNITY : I got to -- these are two great ideas that obviously work . \nIt 's very frustrating . \nLet me bring Alia Sabur in here . \nFirst all , you were 10 years old when you were going to college . \nALIA SABUR , NANOTECHNOLOGY PROFESSOR : Yes . \nHANNITY : How -- and your parents are here , they must be so proud . \nAnd you were teaching in college at 18 . \nHANNITY : You 're a professor . \nNow I read your story first in The New York Post . \nAnd you came up with a brilliant idea . \nWhy do n't you tell everybody ? \nWe have a picture of it but I want you to explain it yourself . \nSABUR : Well , the basic idea is that instead of trying to put something on to the pipe or around the pipe . \nSABUR : To try and basically stop it or to put a cork in it even . \nHANNITY : Put a cork in it . \nHANNITY : All right . \nNow just -- we have on the screen a diagram of what you came up with here . \nAnd the pipe is where -- you decided that you would try and plug it up with tires , right ? \nAnd it would be like rings of tires in a row -- SABUR : Like donuts around it . \nAnd then you have them deflated . \nIt would be tricky enough to get that kind of construction in there with them deflated . \nSo they need to be as small as possible and then we fill them up with hydraulic fluid . \nHANNITY : How do -- as I read this I was thinking to myself , but I 'm not the brilliant engineer , you are . \nHow would you inflate the tires at that point ? \nSABUR : They are doing everything with robots . \nHANNITY : So you think they 'd be able to inflate them even 5,000 feet down ? \nSABUR : That 's how robots work on hydraulic fluid . \nHANNITY : All right , I 'm not the engineer , you are . \nBut now you did meet with , I understand -- you did meet with the head of BP . \nYou initiated the meeting , correct ? \nSABUR : Yes , and it was somewhat similar to what -- what was just mentioned . \nAnd I went down there and I tried to get a hold of someone just to listen to me . \nAnd I guess that it happened to work out well and then I met this guy , a BP executive . \nAnd I said , you know , look , I have this idea , can you take a look at it ? \nAnd first he did n't think it was my idea , because -- SABUR : Look at you and look at your two other guests , and then look at me . \nDo I look like the kind of person that comes up with this kind of idea ? \nHANNITY : You look like the person that I would like to invest a lot of money in the future , because you 're all very smart . \nI hope -- I mean this in all sincerity . \nI 'm worried about the fishermen . \nI 'm worried about the tourism industry . \nI 'm worried about our environment and our beaches . \nI want to say congratulations to you and to all of you for what you 're doing , your efforts . \nI hope somebody , you know , as Santelli said on the -- on the floor of the stock exchange : White House are you listening ?

'' \nOne target for the presidential foot : Tony Hayward , the embattled chief executive of BP . \nObama was asked by Matt Lauer of NBC 's `` Today '' about Hayward 's past comments that `` I want my life back , '' that the Gulf was `` a big ocean '' and that `` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest . '' \n`` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements , '' Obama said , according to excerpts released by NBC . \nThe interview was to air Tuesday . \nNBC aired portions and put out some excerpts Monday night . \nIt was part of a stepped-up White House effort to show Obama is actively engaged in dealing with the worst oil spill in the nation 's history , and to distance itself from the London-based oil giant , formerly known as British Petroleum . \nPolls have shown a majority of Americans believe Obama has handled the crisis poorly . \nThe administration is n't even using the same figures as BP any more for how much oil is flowing from the blown-out well and how much is being captured . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told a White House briefing Monday that a cap on the damaged oil well is now keeping up to 462,000 gallons of oil a day from leaking into the Gulf , up sharply from previous amounts . \nBut his figures conflicted slightly with BP 's numbers . \nIn a statement , BP put the amount being captured at 466,200 gallons . \nAllen said the government was using its own flow-rate calculations and no longer wanted to rely on those from BP . \nObama met Monday with his Cabinet and Allen for a briefing on the oil spill , which began April 20 with an explosion and fire that killed 11 workers on a BP-leased rig . \nIn remarks after that meeting , Obama sought to reassure the nation that the Gulf Coast would `` bounce back '' from the spill -- but not without time , effort and reimbursement from BP . \nBP is the majority owner of the oil well that blew , but other energy companies are also partners and will bear proportionate financial responsibility . \nObama stepped up his rhetoric with NBC 's Lauer while on a trip to Kalamazoo , Mich. , to deliver a high-school commencement address . \nHe strongly defended his role in dealing with the crisis , including his three visits to the region since the spill began . \n`` I was down there a month ago before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf , '' Obama said . \nObama said he has talked to a variety of `` experts '' on the oil spill in addition to the fishermen . \n`` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar , we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers -- so I know whose ass to kick , '' the president said . \n"}

'' \nDiamond Offshore said late Tuesday there had been no leak from its rig . \nThe Coast Guard and MMS said earlier Tuesday that they were putting information together about the site but had not commented again by late in the day . \nMMS records show Taylor Energy has been working on cleaning up , decommissioning and abandoning the site since 2005 . \nHundreds of platforms and wells dot the Gulf of Mexico , and releases of oil are not uncommon . \nAlthough Taylor Energy sold virtually all its properties in 2009 to Ankor Energy LLC , which retained most of Taylor 's staff and top management , Ankor said Tuesday that the lease was still owned and handled by Taylor . \n"}

'' \n`` The plume is largely water , '' Joye wrote on her website Gulf Oil Blog , `` not thick oil like you see on the surface in some places , it 's diluted oil and it 's most concentrated closest to the leaking riser pipe . \nThe substance making up the plume is different from the oil on the surface of the Gulf , however . \n`` Think of it as gas-saturated oil that has been shot out of a deep sea cannon under intense pressure , '' she writes . \n`` It 's like putting olive oil in a spray can , pressurizing it and pushing the spray button . \nWhat comes out when you push that button ? \nA mist of olive oil . \nThis well is leaking a mist of oil that is settling out in the deep sea . '' \nBP has insisted that oil from the leaking well is on the surface of the water . \n`` It 's having a clear impact that you can see throughout the water column , '' she said , and the NOAA finally admitted its existence as well . \nIn a separate news conference , NOAA head Jane Lubchenco confirmed the finding , acknowledging that `` yes , there is oil in the water column . '' \nThe agency planned to analyze the several studies that have pointed to the existence of subsurface oil , which the U.S. agency confirms reach as far as 142 miles from the spill . \nJoye and her team have just returned from a two-week research expedition to document the plume 's distribution , to measure the activity of microbes that break down the oil , and to measure variables such as dissolved oxygen concentration . \n`` There is a tremendous amount of oxygen consumption in the plumes , '' she wrote on her blog , at least 5-10 times higher than elsewhere in the ocean . \nJoye worries that the high rate of oxygen depletion will starve any oxygen-breathing life in the waters . \nOne of the main tacks BP has taken to clean up the spilled oil has been the use of dispersants , which break the oil up into smaller elements . \n`` The solution to pollution is not dilution , '' Joye quipped . \n`` This is an excuse , and it takes away from the important things we should be thinking about . '' \nIn August , the Gulf currents will reverse and slosh back , she noted , meaning that the substances in the water will remain for a long time , and will have a long-term impact . \nShe stressed the need to document and assess the scale of the impact the oil will have on the environment . \n"}

'' \nIt was his fifth trip to the region since April 20 explosion on a deepwater rig that caused the spill . \nObama said he knows Gulf Coast residents have been frustrated by the slow payment of claims from a $ 20 billion BP fund for those who have suffered damages as a result of the spill , and he pledged to rectify that . \n`` Any delays -- by BP or by those managing the new fund -- are unacceptable , and I will keep pushing to get these claims expedited , '' Obama said . \nPerhaps the most intriguing question of the Obamas ' 27-hour dash south was whether the president would take a dip in the Gulf . \nThe president and first lady were joined at a roundtable discussion by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , Navy Secretary Ray Mabus , a former Mississippi governor appointed by Obama to develop a long-term Gulf restoration plan ; the mayors of Panama City and Panama City Beach ; the general manager of a three-hotel chain that has had 1,000 room night cancellations due to the spill , translating into more than $ 191,000 in lost room revenue alone ; the owner of a charter boat company ; and the co-owner of a restaurant and two fishing boats . \nTourism officials say the region typically brings in 70 percent of its yearly income between June and August . \nAlthough only 16 of the 180 beaches in the western part of the Panhandle were affected by the spill , tourism officials say many potential visitors have stayed away , deterred by images of oil-slicked waters and tarball-strewn beaches in other parts of the region . \nThe head of the U.S. Travel Association has proposed that BP , responsible for the oil spill , set aside $ 500 million for a marketing campaign to help draw tourists to the Gulf states . \nAlabama 's attorney general on Thursday sued BP and others companies associated with the spill , seeking unspecified economic and punitive damages . \nAt least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig . \nThe White House scheduled the Obamas ' trip after facing criticism that the president was n't heeding his own advice that Americans vacation in the Gulf . \n`` This is still a place that 's open for business and welcoming so vacationers and people can have a wonderful holiday here , '' Obama said during a June trip to Pensacola , Fla. -- one of his four to the region before this weekend . \nThe first lady went a step further during a July visit to Panama City Beach . \n`` One of the best ways that fellow Americans can help is to come on down here and spend some money , '' she said . \nObama has vacationed in North Carolina this summer and is heading to Martha 's Vineyard , off the Massachusetts coast , later in August . \nMrs. Obama also traveled to Spain this month with Sasha . \nThe government 's point man on the spill , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Friday that the blown-out well was not securely plugged to his satisfaction . \nHe said that drilling a relief well -- long regarded as the only way to ensure that the hole at the bottom of the Gulf never leaks oil again -- must go forward . \nWork on the relief well was suspended this week because of bad weather . \n"}

'' \nNot all scientists are critical of the NOAA report . \nPeter Lane , the chairman of the ASTM F20 Committee on Oil Spills and Hazardous Substances , who is also the president of Applied Fabric Technologies , an oil spill clean-up equipment company , agreed with its conclusions . \n`` I thought the oil was gone or was going to be gone about five days after the blowout , '' said Lane . \n`` The rest is just backpedaling by those who made dire predictions about the long-lasting effects of oil going all over the world . '' \n`` They have no idea how to put something like this into perspective , they want to shed blame on someone and\\/or gain political mileage , '' he added . \nInterestingly , Lane said those who are critical of the clean-up process are usually uninformed about what is required for the clean-up efforts -- armchair quarterbacks for oil spills . \n`` The oil industry and BP were the only ones prepared in any way to do anything , '' Lane said . \n`` The -LRB- United States Coast Guard -RRB- and Navy have equipment which they contributed , the USCG has some personnel who helped on oversight , but the rest of them are first-time spill fighters who are learning from a clean sheet of paper . '' \nWhile researchers have taken issue with the process used to evaluate the remaining oil deposits , the NOAA defended its process as highly scientific and thorough . \n`` Scientists have been conducting ongoing testing for subsurface oil using a number of techniques , including the use of fluorometric and acoustic scanning , monitoring of dissolved oxygen in the water column , and collecting water samples for detailed chemical analysis in the laboratory , '' said Chris Vaccaro , an NOAA spokesperson . \n`` Research vessels owned and operated by NOAA and by our academic partners have been continuously testing the subsurface oil since this disaster began and will continuing doing so since we know oil still exists below the surface , '' he told FoxNews.com On one issue all sides seem to agree : The long-term impact of the oil spill is still a concern . \nNOAA head Jane Lubchenco , speaking at a press briefing last week , made it clear that the oil leak 's effects will linger , though the NOAA claims the oil is mostly gone . \n`` We remain concerned about the long-term impacts , both on the marshes and the wildlife , but also beneath the surface , and are actively studying that , both as part of our federal response and in partnership with much of the academic community that is also very interested in the overall long-term impacts of this , '' she said . \n"}
{"id": "374", "time": "2010-08-14", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- Now that the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history has effectively been stopped , the White House is considering an early end to its moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nBut four months after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon , regulators have only started to make good on promises to overhaul drilling . \nTough measures are stalled in Congress . \nA $ 1 billion emergency response network proposed by the industry wo n't be operational for another year . \nAnd while doomsday scenarios from the BP spill , like oil washing up the East Coast , have not come to pass , there are no guarantees that drilling will be any safer once it does resume . \nWhat 's changed is `` not enough to make a big difference , '' said Charles Perrow , a Yale professor who has studied the spill in the Gulf . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar has halted deepwater drilling until Nov. 30 , saying the BP spill demonstrated the industry was n't prepared for a massive underwater blowout . \nHe 's ordered rigs to re-examine their equipment and safety procedures , and next month plans to order new safeguards for blowout preventers . \nBefore drillers can return to the deep water , however , Salazar said the industry should be able to show that it 's capable of responding to and containing future blowouts . \nSome energy experts , engineering consultants and Gulf Coast leaders joined Big Oil to ask Salazar to change his mind . \nDrilling was safe before the BP spill , they said , and Gulf communities that depend on the industry were suffering unfairly . \nThat argument appears to have gained traction , even among people most affected by the spill , now that BP is close to plugging the well for good . \nBilly Nungesser , president of hard-hit Plaquemines Parish , La. , said he 's seen attitudes change in his community now that the deepsea disaster is easing . \nEven though oil has been washing ashore for months and he 's fought constantly with BP and the government over their response , Nungesser thinks the ban should be lifted . \nOffshore drilling means jobs . \nAccording to the most recent state data , the oil and gas industry supports more than 320,000 jobs in Louisiana and generates more than $ 12.7 billion in household earnings . \nGeorge Hirasaki , a Rice University engineering professor who was involved in the oil containment effort in the Bay Marchand field off Louisiana after a rig burned in the early 1970s , agrees . \n`` I think what is needed is improved standards and procedures , and not just restrictions on drilling , '' Hirasaki said . \nAs Salazar continues to weigh the evidence , others close to President Obama are questioning the ban . \nWilliam K. Reilly , a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who co-chairs the president 's commission investigating the oil spill , said in an interview with The Associated Press that he does n't understand why rigs that have passed inspections ca n't resume drilling even while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management conducts a broader review of safety offshore . \nThe group also asked the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center to look into the `` wisdom of using a moratorium '' for preventing spills in the aftermath of the BP disaster , according to a copy of the letter obtained by the AP . \nThe moratorium bans exploratory drilling but not production . \nAt an estimated 1.66 million barrels of per day , Gulf oil production accounts for about 30 percent of domestic output . \nHowever , the government estimates 2011 production at just 1.54 million barrels per day -- equal to 2009 levels -- in part because no new wells are currently being drilled . \nBy contract , the U.S. is expected to import 9.11 million barrels per day this year . \nOpponents say the moratorium will only boost the need for foreign oil , but the government currently forecasts a drop in imports next year because of increased production onshore in the U.S. Meanwhile , the offshore drilling industry is facing its biggest overhaul in decades . \nShortly after the April 20 rig explosion , Salazar ordered rig owners to re-evaluate their emergency procedures and re-examine safety equipment . \nA slate of other measures , including a requirement that blowout preventers have additional backup safety equipment , is expected next month . \nOther regulations could be announced in the next 12 months . \nCongress also is considering measures that could make the Gulf one of the strictest places on the planet for offshore drillers to work . \nBills in the House and Senate would lift the $ 75 million cap on liabilities for economic damages -- such as lost wages , shortened fishing seasons or lagging tourism . \nIf that becomes law , smaller drillers probably would be forced out of the Gulf , analysts said . \nIt `` pushes the smaller guys out , '' Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said . \n`` They 're going to be afraid of the risks . '' \nBP essentially waived its rights under the cap . \nAs of Aug. 5 , it had spent more than $ 6 billion on the spill , about $ 303 million of that on claims payments to more than 40,000 individuals and businesses . \nAnd BP is expected to pay billions more as hundreds of lawsuits work their way through the court system . \nA bill that passed the House includes a provision that would shut out anyone with a poor safety record -- like BP -- from gaining new permits . \nBut the Obama administration may hesitate to limit BP 's ability to operate in the Gulf . \nA $ 20 billion compensation fund established for victims ' of the oil spill may use revenue from BP 's oil and gas drilling as collateral , according to details released this week by the White House . \n`` Let 's face facts , '' says Nungesser . \n`` BP needs that oil coming out of the ground . \nAnybody tells you differently is lying to you . '' \nWhile driller Diamond Offshore moved a couple of rigs out of the Gulf , and another 30-some rigs are idle or doing other work , economists say job losses resulting from the moratorium so far have been fewer than predicted by the industry . \nIn Louisiana , the staging site for most of the deepwater Gulf industry , there were 595 first-time claims for jobless benefits in the 099mining sector in June and July , according to the Louisiana Work force Commission . \nThat sector consists almost entirely of the petroleum industry . \nEven so , the region still could lose tens of thousands of jobs if the moratorium continues , said David Dismukes , associate executive director for the Louisiana State University Center for Energy Studies . \nStill , the decision on the moratorium will come down to safety . \nFour top oil companies -- Shell , Exxon , Chevron and ConocoPhillips -- are pitching in on a rapid-response spill containment system , a step towards meeting Salazar 's requirement that the industry demonstrate a better response capability . \nSome pieces will be ready around year 's end but others wo n't be ready for another year or so . \nSalazar has said a fully operational system was n't a perquisite for lifting the ban . \nBut experts like Perrow , the Yale sociologist , wonder what 's the rush , given the devastating impact that this one spill has had . \nHe says the U.S. would benefit if it waits for the government to write new rules that increases scrutiny of drilling operations . \nThe industry also needs to find ways to keep rigs from drilling too quickly and putting their wells at risk of a blowout , he said . \n`` They do n't want accidents , they 're expensive , '' Perrow said . \n"}
{"id": "1094", "time": "2010-10-29", "text": "April 21 , 2010 : Fire boat response crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon , off Louisiana . \nReuters Aug. 3 : In this image taken from video provided by BP PLC , the new 75-ton cap sits atop the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP WASHINGTON -- Tests performed before the deadly blowout of BP 's oil well in the Gulf of Mexico should have raised doubts about the cement used to seal the well , but the company and its cementing contractor used it anyway , investigators with the president 's oil spill commission said Thursday . \nIt 's the first finding from the commission looking into the causes of the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nAnd it appears to conflict with statements made by Halliburton Co. , which has said its tests showed the cement mix was stable . \nThe company , which has blamed BP 's well design and operational decisions for the disaster , acknowledged in a six-page statement released late Thursday that it never tested the final mixture of cement for stability after BP made a last-minute change to the mix . \nThe cement mix 's failure to prevent oil and gas from entering the well has been identified by BP and others as one of the causes of the accident . \nBP and Halliburton decided to use a foam slurry created by injecting nitrogen into cement to secure the bottom of the well , a decision outside experts have criticized . \nThe panel said that of four tests done in February and April by Halliburton , only one -- the last -- showed the mix would hold . \nBut the results of that single successful test were not shared with BP , and may not have reached Halliburton , before the cement was pumped , according to a letter sent to commissioners Thursday by chief investigative counsel Fred H. Bartlit Jr. . \nHalliburton said Thursday that that successful test was performed on a mixture different than the one eventually used . \nWhile some tests were conducted on the new formulation requested by BP , those tests did not include a foam stability test , the company said . \nAccording to the panel , BP at the time of the blowout had in hand results from only one of the tests -- a February analysis sent to BP by Halliburton in a March 8 e-mail that indicated the cement could fail . \nThe slurry tested in that case was a slightly different blend , and assumed a slightly different well design , but there is no indication that Halliburton flagged the problem for BP , or that BP had concerns , the letter said . \n`` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well , '' Bartlit wrote . \nIndependent tests conducted for the commission by Chevron on a nearly identical mixture were also released Thursday . \nThe results concluded that the cement mix was unstable , raising questions about the validity of Halliburton 's test showing that the near-final mixture was stable . \nThe company said the `` significant differences '' between its internal tests and the commission 's were caused by the use of different materials . \nBP , as part of its internal investigation , also conducted independent tests that showed the cement mix was flawed , but its analysis too was criticized by Halliburton , which said it was not the correct formula . \nBP 's report also mentioned a cement test Halliburton performed in mid-April , but it appears BP obtained the results after the accident and considered its methods flawed . \nBy contrast , the commission obtained proprietary additives from Halliburton as well as a recipe to re-create the slurry that was used on the well . \nOne and a half gallons of the actual mix used on the rig remain , but it is being held as evidence in criminal and civil investigations . \nHalliburton rejected the commission 's claims that the February tests were conducted on a cement that was similar to the one used . \n`` Contrary to the letter ... the slurry tested in February was not ' a very similar foam slurry design to the one actually pumped , '' ' the statement reads . \nThe company also says there were significant differences in how the cement was tested . \nHalliburton shares dropped from near $ 34 to below $ 30 in New York trading in the half hour after the commission released its finding . \nThe shares recovered a bit , and closed at $ 31.68 , down $ 2.74 , or 8 percent . \nBP shares rose from $ 40.38 to $ 41.28 , then quickly reversed course and fell to $ 40.28 . \nThe shares finished trading with a gain of 49 cents at $ 40.59 . \nThe independent investigators do not address other decisions that could have contributed to the cement 's failure and the eventual blowout , such as BP 's decision to use fewer centralizers than recommended by Halliburton . \nCentralizers make sure the well 's piping is centered inside the well so the cement bonds correctly . \nBP has also been criticized for not performing a cement bond long , a test that checks after the cement is pumped down whether it is secure . \nThere are also questions about whether BP pumped down enough cement to seal off the bottom of the well , which was located more than three miles below sea level . \n"}

'' \nFeinberg said he was still sorting out how to deal with indirect claims like hotels that lose bookings because tourists think the beaches are covered in oil , or people who see their property values decline but live several blocks away from an oiled beach . \n`` There 's no question that the property value has diminished as a result of the spill . \nThat does n't mean that every property is entitled to compensation , '' he said , adding : `` There 's not enough money in the world to pay everybody who 'd like to have money . '' \nFeinberg , who headed a compensation fund for victims of the September 11 attacks , assured lawmakers the fund would be `` totally independent '' and said BP had agreed to top up the escrow account as needed to meet proper claims . \nThe British energy giant has already disbursed more than $ 130 million in emergency payments to fishermen and others affected by the slick . \nFeinberg said lump sum payments would be offered to claimants once the true extent of the damage is assessed . \n`` It sure would help if the oil would stop , '' he told the committee . \nMeanwhile the Animal Welfare Institute -LRB- AWI -RRB- and other groups sued BP over the turtles ' deaths and asked a federal court to stop the company 's `` controlled burns . '' \n`` It is horrifying that these innocent creatures whose habitat has already been devastated by the oil spill are now being burned alive , '' AWI President Cathy Liss told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana . \nThe lawsuit filed by AWI , Center for Biological Diversity , Turtle Island Restoration Network and Animal Legal Defense Fund said BP was violating the Endangered Species Act and other laws with their `` controlled burns '' in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThey asked the court for a temporary restraining order to stop all burning activities `` until ... mechanisms are implemented that will prevent any additional sea turtles from being burned alive . '' \nAlso on Wednesday , Obama ordered the development of a long-term plan to `` restore the unique beauty and bounty '' of the Gulf Coast . \nThe Long-Term Gulf Restoration Support Plan aims to `` ensure economic recovery , community planning , science-based restoration of the ecosystem and environment , public health and safety efforts , and support of individuals and businesses who suffered losses due to the spill , '' a White House memo said . \nAn estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have been gushing out of the ruptured well since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank on April 22 some 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nEfforts to permanently plug the leak by drilling relief wells continued despite the rough seas which had forced a halt to skimming operations off the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nTwo containment ships continued to capture the oil at a rate of about 25,000 barrels per day despite seven-foot -LRB- two-meter -RRB- swells . \nBut the rough seas delayed the deployment of a third ship aimed at doubling the containment capacity . \nAnd officials warned that drilling and containment will be suspended for about 14 days if the spill zone is threatened by a more direct storm hit . \nThat could delay the completion of the wells until at least September and would dump an additional 490,000 to 840,000 barrels of extra oil into the Gulf . \nSenior government officials were set to meet with Obama Thursday to discuss whether a new containment system should be installed in the interim . \nThat system would further raise capacity , but would require the current cap to be removed and involve careful manipulation some 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- below the surface . \n"}
{"id": "1067", "time": "2010-07-01", "text": "June 30 : Hurricane Alex is seen lashing the Mexico coastline , south of Brownsville , Texas . \nNOAA Alex may have cooled off , but hurricane season is just starting to heat up in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAnd absurdly warm oceans combined with still air mean storms will continue . \nCould Bonnie , Colin , Danielle and the rest of the forthcoming storms spell disaster for BP 's oil spill ? \nThree major forecasts from the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- , Accuweather and Colorado State have all called for dramatic hurricane seasons this year . \nThose predictions are n't particularly meaningful , oddly enough -- and that comes straight from the forecasters themselves . \n`` The seasonal forecasts are of interest to a lot of people , but they 're not terribly accurate , '' admitted James Franklin , branch chief of the NHC 's Hurricane Specialists Unit . \nAnd not particularly meaningful , he says . \n`` Even if we did do a real good job hitting it year after year , it does n't give you a good indication of where storms are going to go . '' \nStill , the guidance is useful . \nAnd if the first Atlantic hurricane of the season is just a taste of the season to come , we 're in for a bumpy -- and lengthy -- season . \nSo what causes hurricanes , and why is this season so dangerous ? \n`` The basic idea of a hurricane is one of a heat engine , '' Franklin told FoxNews.com . \nIt converts the energy of the ocean into gale force winds . \nAnd this year , the ocean has far more energy than usual . \nWhen waters are above about 80 degrees , conditions are ripe for hurricanes , and they can get much hotter in the tropics . \n`` Waters in the tropical Atlantic between Africa and the Lesser Antilles are just about as warm as we 've ever seen them , '' he said . \nIn a recent update to their annual forecast , Colorado State 's Philip J. Klotzbach and William M. Gray describe them as `` running at near-record warm levels . '' \nFor a hurricane to be created , some pre-existing disturbance near Africa , a low-pressure system for example , forms the spark from which the hurricane will ignite . \nThat tropical weakness moves out into the balmy waters of the Atlantic and gasses up . \nThe second big factor is wind . \nStrong winds in the upper air disperse tropical waves , disrupting hurricane formation and scattering pent-up heat . \nThe NHC is predicting much more favorable wind patterns this year than last year -- La Nina or neutral conditions , as opposed to the El Nino conditions of strong winds from last year . \n`` In order to make a hurricane go , the heat coming from the ocean and released in a rising motion in the atmosphere has to be concentrated in one place . \nIf winds in the atmosphere are blowing in different directions , that disperses heat . '' \nSo having uniform winds is important -- and a rare event . \nDry air also means water vapor ca n't condense , clouds do n't gather , rain does n't fall and hurricanes do n't form . \nA third factor is the cyclical nature of the weather . \nHurricane activity tends to run in long , 20 - to 30-year cycles . \nSince 1995 , we 've been in a cycle of increased activity . \nAlex did n't move over the Gulf oil spill directly , so scientists and meteorologists were unable to directly observe the effects of the weather on the oil . \nBut Franklin thinks we 'll see winds dispersing the oil -- something BP has actively tried to do itself . \nIn that sense , hurricane season may be a blessing for the oil crisis . \n`` If the storm tracks to the west of the oil , there is the potential that the counter-clockwise circulation of the hurricane could drive some of the oil further toward the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nAlternatively , a storm tracking to the east of the oil could push the oil further offshore . \nBut , little is understood about the interaction of tropical cyclones and oil , '' the scientists write . \nFortunately , there 's no evidence to suggest storms will suck the crude into the clouds , creating a foul rain of oil on coasts . \nBut weather forecasters do n't know enough at present to really predict what will happen . \nAnd Franklin is optimistic that BP technicians will cap the well and clean the oil before what-ifs turn into learning situations . \n`` Hopefully we wo n't learn anything about it .

'' \nAnd passing Ixtoc just before the July Fourth weekend , a time of normally booming tourism , is bitter timing , he said . \nThe BP spill , which began after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion killed 11 workers April 20 , is also the largest spill ever recorded offshore during peacetime . \nBut it 's not the biggest in history . \nThat happened when Iraqi forces opened valves at a terminal and dumped as much as 336 million gallons of oil in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nInitial estimates put that spill at about 460 million gallons , but government estimates later found it to be smaller . \nAs the Gulf gusher continued spewing , the remnants of Hurricane Alex whipped oil-filled waves onto the Gulf Coast 's once-white beaches . \nThe government has pinned its latest cleanup hopes on a huge new piece of equipment : the world 's largest oil-skimming vessel , which arrived Wednesday . \nOfficials hope the ship can scoop up to 21 million gallons of oil-fouled water a day . \nDubbed the `` A Whale , '' the Taiwanese-flagged former tanker spans the length of 31\\/2 football fields and is 10 stories high . \nIt just emerged from an extensive retrofitting to prepare it specifically for the Gulf . \n`` It is absolutely gigantic . \nIt 's unbelievable , '' said Overton , who saw the ship last week in Norfolk , Va. . \nThe vessel looks like a typical tanker , but it takes in contaminated water through 12 vents on either side of the bow . \nThe oil is then supposed to be separated from the water and transferred to another vessel . \nThe water is channeled back into the sea . \nBut the ship 's never been tested , and many questions remain about how it will operate . \nFor instance , the seawater retains trace amounts of oil , even after getting filtered , so the Environmental Protection Agency will have to sign off on allowing the treated water back into the Gulf . \n`` This is a no-brainer , '' Overton said . \n`` You 're bringing in really dirty , oily water and you 're putting back much cleaner water . '' \nThe Coast Guard will have the final say in whether the vessel can operate in the Gulf . \nThe owner , shipping firm TMT Group , will have to come to separate terms with BP , which is paying for the cleanup . \n`` I do n't know whether it 's going to work or not , but it certainly needs to be given the opportunity , '' Overton said . \nMeanwhile along parts of the Gulf , red flags snapped in strong gusts , warning people to stay out of the water , and long stretches of beach were stained brown from tar balls and crude oil that had been pushed as far as 60 yards from the water . \nHurricane Alex churned up rough seas as it plowed across the Gulf , dealing a tough setback to cleanup operations . \nIt made landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of coast in Mexico 's northern Tamaulipas state late Wednesday , spawning tornadoes in nearby Texas and forcing evacuations in both countries . \nAlex weakened to a tropical storm Thursday morning as it moved across Mexico . \nAlthough skimming operations and the laying of oil-corralling booms were halted across the Gulf , vessels that collect and burn oil and gas at the site of the explosion were still operating . \nEfforts to drill relief wells that experts hope will stop the leak also continued unabated . \nIn Florida , lumps of tar the size of dinner plates filled a large swath of beach east of Pensacola after rough waves tossed the mess onto shore . \nStreaks of the rust-red oil could be seen in the waves off Pensacola Beach as cleanup crews worked in the rough weather to prepare the beach for the holiday weekend . \nIn Grand Isle , La. , heavy bands of rain pounded down , keeping cleanup crews off the water and tossing carefully laid boom around . \nHowever , oil had stayed out of the passes . \n`` All this wave action is breaking up the oil very quickly , '' Coast Guard Cmdr. Randal S. Ogrydziak said . \n`` Mother Nature is doing what she does best , putting things back in order . '' \nNatural microbes in the water were also working on the spill . \nThe result was a white substance that looked like mayonnaise , that washed up on some spots along the Grand Isle beach . \n`` People will be fishing here again , '' Ogrydziak said . \n`` It may take a while , but people may be surprised that it 's not taking as long as they thought . \nLook at the -LRB- Ixtoc -RRB- oil spill in Mexico . \nIt was massive and now people are back to using those waters .

Marcus Woodring , the Coast Guard commander for the Houston\\/Galveston sector . \nTwo gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island , though tests have not yet confirmed the oil 's origin . \nWoodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill . \nBut there 's no way to confirm how they got there . \nHurricane Alex , which blew through the Gulf last week and made landfall along the border between Texas and Mexico , may have played a small role in bringing the oil ashore in Texas by increasing the westerly current near land , Graber said . \nBut it was more likely due to normal coastal currents and local weather patterns . \nNOAA scientists are looking at local weather , Hurricane Alex and Gulf vessels as possible sources for the tar balls , agency spokeswoman Monica Allen said Monday . \nThe distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles . \nOil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29 . \nThe spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana . \nStrings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets , one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain , the large lake north of New Orleans . \n`` So far it 's scattered stuff showing up , mostly tar balls , '' said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina . \n`` It will pull out with the tide , and then show back up . '' \nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said assets would be deployed to protect the Lake Pontchartrain basin . \nPausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake , taking a backdoor route to New Orleans . \nThe news of the spill 's reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds . \nA tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up Monday afternoon , bringing heavy rain and winds . \nLast week , the faraway Hurricane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama , Florida and Mississippi with choppy seas and stiff winds . \nNow they 're idled by the smaller storms that could last well into this week . \nOfficials have plans for the worst-case scenario : a hurricane barreling up the Gulf toward the spill site . \nBut the less-dramatic weather conditions have been met with a more makeshift response . \nSkimming across the Gulf has scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil-fouled water so far , but officials say it 's impossible to know how much crude could have been sucked up in good weather because of the fluctuating number of boats and other variables . \nJerry Biggs , a commercial fisherman in Pass Christian , Miss. , who has had to shut down because of the spill , is now hiring out his 13 boats and 40-man crew to BP for cleanup . \nHe said skimming is severely hampered by the weather . \n`` This is n't going away . \nThis is n't a sneeze or a hiccup . \nThis is diarrhea for a long time , '' he said . \n`` My lifestyle is screwed . \nThe thing that I love the most I 'm not going to be able to do anymore . '' \nThe British company has now seen its costs from the spill reach $ 3.12 billion , a figure that does n't include a $ 20 billion fund for damages the company created last month . \nThe storms have not affected drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak . \nThe company expects drilling to be finished by mid-August . \nFox News ' Phil Keating and the Associated Press contributed to this report Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}

{"id": "649", "time": "2010-07-30", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The House approved a bill Friday to boost safety standards for offshore drilling , remove a federal cap on economic liability for oil spills and impose new fees on oil and gas production . \nDemocratic leaders hailed the bill as a comprehensive response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and said it would increase drilling safety and crack down on oil companies such as BP . \nCompanies with significant workplace safety or environmental violations over the preceding seven years would be banned from new offshore drilling permits . \nRepublicans and some-oil state Democrats opposed the measure , calling it a federal power grab that would raise energy prices and kill thousands of American jobs because of the new fees and liability provision . \nRep. Nick Rahall , D-W . \nVa. , the bill 's main sponsor , said the legislation would be a tribute to the 11 oil rig workers who were killed when the BP well exploded in April by creating strong new safety standards for offshore drilling , ending the revolving door between government regulators and industry and holding BP and other oil companies accountable for accidents . \n`` While we may not know the exact cause of the incident , we clearly know what contributed to it . \nA culture of cozy relationships that had regulators interviewing for jobs on the same rigs they were supposed to be inspecting , '' said Rahall , who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee . \nThe legislation , which passed 209-193 , has yet to be taken up in the Senate , where partisan disagreements will likely delay final consideration of a joint House-Senate bill until after the August congressional recess . \nThe House bill includes a provision sponsored by Rep. Charlie Melancon , D-La . \n, that would modify a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , so that some drilling permits could be approved on a rig-by-rig basis if the Interior Department determines a rig meets new safety requirements . \nThe drilling moratorium imposed by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar would remain in effect , and Salazar would retain power over whether to approve a permit . \nThe bill also would remove the current $ 75 million cap on economic damages to be paid by oil companies after major spills and increases to $ 300 million the financial responsibility offshore operators must demonstrate in most cases . \nAnd it would create new `` conservation '' fees on oil and natural gas extracted from land or water controlled by the federal government . \nThose provisions prompted sharp criticism from Republicans . \n`` In typical Democrat fashion , this bill overtaxes , over-regulates , and costs American jobs , '' said Rep. John Mica , R-Fla . \nRep. Doc Hastings of Washington state , the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee , said removing the liability cap could devastate small and medium-sized drillers . \nHastings called the new fees on oil and gas production a `` $ 22 billion energy tax '' that would cost jobs and raise energy prices . \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the $ 2 per barrel fee on oil and a similar fee on natural gas could bring in $ 22.5 billion over the next decade . \nEarlier Friday , the House approved a separate bill to extend whistleblower protections to oil and gas workers who report hazardous conditions or other problems . \nThe whistleblower bill will be added to the oil spill legislation when it is sent to the Senate . \n`` A whistleblower may be the only thing standing between a safe workplace and a catastrophe , '' said Rep. George Miller , D-Calif . \n, the bill 's sponsor . \n`` No worker should ever have to choose between his life and his livelihood . '' \nRep. Jay Inslee , D-Wash . \n, said the bill setting new drilling standards and removing the liability cap was the least Congress could do to respond to such a major catastrophe . \nRahall said the legislation would end a `` trust-but-don ` t-verify '' attitude about safety where drilling plans were rubber stamped by federal regulators and industry often wrote its own rules . \nThe bill would put into law actions already taken by the Obama administration to break Interior 's former Minerals Management Service into three parts , separating safety enforcement and regulation from economic activities such as issuing oil leases and collecting royalties . \nSince the BP spill the agency has been renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Enforcement and Regulation , and a new director , Michael Bromwich , has been appointed . \nAssociated Press writer Frederic J.

{"id": "1430", "time": "2010-04-28", "text": "April 27 : Weathered oil from a leaking pipeline that resulted the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is seen in the Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana . \nOVER THE GULF OF MEXICO -- It 's a hellish scene : Giant sheets of flame racing across the Gulf of Mexico as thick , black smoke billows high into the sky . \nThis , though , is no Hollywood action movie . \nIt 's the real-life plan to be deployed just 20 miles from the Gulf Coast in a last-ditch effort to burn up an oil spill before it could wash ashore and wreak environmental havoc . \nCrews late Wednesday afternoon started a test burn to see how the technique was working . \nRig operator BP PLC had planned to continue the oil fires after the test , but as night fell , no more were lit . \nThe burns were not expected to be done at night , and the Coast Guard said crews could resume work Thursday morning if the weather cooperated . \nLate Thursday evening the Coast Guard said there was a new leak from spot where platform exploded , sank in Gulf of Mexico . \nCrews planned to use hand-held flares to set fire to sections of the massive spill . \nCrews turned to the plan after failing to stop a 1,000-barrel-a-day leak at the spot where a deepwater oil platform exploded and sank . \nA 500-foot boom was to be used to corral several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , which will then be towed to a more remote area , set on fire , and allowed to burn for about an hour . \nAbout 42,000 gallons of oil a day are leaking into the Gulf from the blown-out well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead . \nThe cause of the explosion has not been determined . \nGreg Pollock , head of the oil spill division of the Texas General Land Office , which is providing equipment for crews in the Gulf , said he is not aware of a similar burn ever being done off the U.S. coast . \nThe last time crews with his agency used fire booms to burn oil was a 1995 spill on the San Jacinto River . \n`` When you can get oil ignited , it is an absolutely effective way of getting rid of a huge percentage of the oil , '' he said . \n`` I ca n't overstate how important it is to get the oil off the surface of the water . '' \nThe oil has the consistency of thick roofing tar . \nWhen the flames go out , Pollock said , the material that is left resembles a hardened ball of tar that can be removed from the water with nets or skimmers . \n`` I would say there is little threat to the environment because it wo n't coat an animal , and because all the volatiles have been consumed if it gets on a shore it can be simply picked up , '' he said . \nAuthorities also said they expect minimal impact on sea turtles and marine mammals in the burn area . \nA graphic posted by the Coast Guard and the industry task force fighting the slick showed it covering an area about 100 miles long and 45 miles across at its widest point . \n`` It 's premature to say this is catastrophic . \nI will say this is very serious , '' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry . \nFrom the air , the thickest parts of the spill resembled rust-colored tentacles of various thickness . \nThe air was thick with the acrid smell of petroleum . \nAmid several of the thicker streaks , four gray whales could be seen swimming in the oil . \nIt was not clear if the whales were in danger . \nMore than two dozen vessels moved about in the heart of the slick pulling oil-sopping booms . \nEarlier Wednesday , Louisiana State Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Robert Barham told lawmakers that federal government projections show a `` high probability '' oil could reach the Pass a Loutre wildlife area Friday night , Breton Sound on Saturday and the Chandeleur Islands on Sunday . \nAs the task force worked far offshore , local officials prepared for the worst in case the oil reaches land . \nIn Plaquemines Parish , a sliver of Louisiana that juts into the Gulf and is home to Pass a Loutre , officials hoped to deploy a fleet of volunteers in fishing boats to spread booms that could block oil from entering inlets . \n`` We 've got oystermen and shrimpers who know this water better than anyone , '' said Plaquemines Paris President Billy Nungesser . \n`` Hopefully the Coast Guard will embrace the idea . '' \nBut there was anxiety that the Gulf Coast was not prepared for the onslaught of oil . \n`` Our ability to deal with this would be like us having a foot of snow falling in Biloxi tomorrow , '' said Vincent Creel , a spokesman for the city government in Biloxi , Miss. `` We do n't have snow plows , and we 're not equipped to deal with this . '' \nThe parish 's emergency manager planned to meet in Houma on Thursday with a Coast Guard official to discuss whether volunteers can help , Nungesser said . \n`` We do n't want to just sit by and hope this -LRB- oil -RRB- does n't come ashore , '' Nungesser said . \nThe decision to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil on the sea bottom 5,000 feet below . \nBP says work will begin as early as Thursday to drill a relief well to relieve pressure at the blowout site , but that could take months . \nAnother option is a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but that will take two weeks to put in place , BP said . \nWinds and currents in the Gulf have helped crews in recent days as they try to contain the leak . \nThe immediate threat to sandy beaches in coastal Alabama and Mississippi has eased . \nBut the spill has moved steadily toward the mouth of the Mississippi River and the wetland areas east of the river , home to hundreds of species of wildlife and near some rich oyster grounds . \nThe cost of the disaster continues to rise and could easily top $ 1 billion . \nIndustry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700 million . \nBP has said its costs for containing the spill are running at $ 6 million a day . \nThe company said it will spend $ 100 million to drill the relief well . \nThe Coast Guard has not yet reported its expenses . \n"}

'' \nSteven Davidoff , a professor at the Ohio State University law school , says history shows that once a class action is granted and large numbers of plaintiffs join in , companies try to settle to avoid the possibility of unmanageable damage awards . \nDavidoff said the potential settlement value for BP shareholders likely will be less than in cases where a company has `` a record of malfeasance at high management . '' \n`` This is not so much a fraud case as a nondisclosure case , '' Davidoff said . \nThe plans that have n't sued are still big enough to get management 's attention . \n`` We do intend to engage BP in a corporate governance discussion at the appropriate time because the shareowner losses are severe given the catastrophic failures related to the oil spill , '' says Patricia Macht , a spokesperson for the California Public Employees Retirement System . \nCalpers , with $ 205 billion in assets , said it has n't altered its basic five-year `` buy-and-hold '' strategy -- although the value of its BP holdings fell from about $ 585.7 million on April 20 to $ 289.2 million on June 30 . \nIt 's still just a paper loss -- and Calpers retains its shareholder voting power . \nThat power could be used at annual shareholder meetings to vote against upper management and board directors . \nBut BP 's next annual meeting does n't occur until April . \nMany observers say a shake-up is possible before then , likely involving CEO Tony Hayward . \nBP did not return a request for comment on any potential conversation with Calpers . \nOther pension funds , including the $ 96.7 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas , the $ 47 billion Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System and the $ 8 billion Louisiana State Employees Retirement System say their BP holdings represent only a tiny fraction of their total investments . \nNone would say what their next action might be . \nAlabama 's four state pension dumped their BP stock . \nThe executive director of the Retirement Systems of Alabama , David Bonner , said 6.25 million shares were sold in June . \nThe funds lost just over $ 4 million overall on the transactions . \nBut since the funds accumulated $ 25.9 million in dividends over 15 years , `` We 're $ 21 million ahead , '' Bonner said . \nBP 's traditional employee pension fund has n't lost a dime on BP shares : The fund 's rules forbid it to either buy company stock or make company loans . \nAccording to the fund 's 2008 audit , the latest year for which figures are available , its top holding was in rival Royal Dutch Shell with 3.1 percent of its assets invested . \n"}

{"id": "1946", "time": "2010-08-23", "text": "Just last week , a House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment held a hearing on the current status of the BP oil spill cleanup effort in the Gulf . \nSubcommittee Chair Ed Markey , the only committee member to attend the hearing during recess , stated his disapproval of the often criticized BP efforts to clean up the spill . \nSome speculate that effort has been hampered by a tight budget and resistance to expensive , if experimental new cleanup efforts that could have protected more of the Gulf coastline . \nMarkey 's displeasure with cleanup efforts and the subsequent impact on the seafood industry ; however , still do not get to the heart of the matter . \nWithout BP 's disregard for safety leading up to the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the seafood industry and the broader Gulf Region would not face these dire circumstances . \nInstead of condemning an entire industry for what one company did , Congress must look specifically at BP 's safety history and every American must demand that they do so . \nGovernment overreaction to the missteps of one safety outlier are resulting in further desperation and economic degradation in our minority communities who rely on the many jobs provided by the oil and gas industry . \nPunishment must be doled out as a result of the gross safety oversight in the Gulf , but it must be directed toward those at fault , not the hardworking Americans currently being deprived of jobs . \nBelow is a list of failures on the part of BP , a company whose reckless and careless actions have severely damaged both the Gulf Coast and energy industry : For more than a decade before the fateful Gulf oil spill disaster , BP was frequently alleged to be sacrificing occupational and environmental safety to control costs , whether by intimidating its workers who spoke out or by cutting maintenance budgets ; by sweating low-impact events instead of larger risks , or just by not having a strong enough `` safety culture '' to avoid occasional breakdowns . \nWhatever the causes , BP 's safety failures have sometimes been so dramatic that they attract publicity . \nHere are the worst offenses , several taking place at the same facilities . \nTHUNDER HORSE , JULY 2005 Thunder Horse PDQ is the largest offshore platform of its kind in the world . \nIt was designed to survive a once-in-a-century hurricane event , but just months after completion this $ 5 billion marvel was nearly capsized by an incorrectly plumbed 6-inch length of pipe . \nThunder Horse was evacuated at the approach of Hurricane Dennis , and three days later the titanic platform was sighted tilting heavily in the water , in danger of sinking . \nThe hurricane was n't at fault ; the pipe had simply allowed water to flow freely into ballast tanks on one side of the platform . \nThe water damaged pumps , motors , wiring and cables , forcing an estimated $ 250 million in repairs . \nLater tests would reveal inch-wide gashes in the undersea pipeline caused by inadequate welds . \nAs The New York Times reported , `` It could have been catastrophic , '' said Gordon A. Aaker Jr. , a senior engineering consultant on the project . \n`` You would have lost a lot of oil a mile down before you would have even known . \nIt could have been a helluva spill -- much like the Deepwater Horizon . '' \nAnd that , of course , would have moved this incident much closer to # 1 . \nFor years , a BP subsidiary was permitted to police its own facilities in the Los Angeles area for emissions problems . \nBP 's Carson Refinery , to take their word for it , `` had nearly perfect compliance , reporting no tank problems and making virtually no repairs . '' \nHow convenient for a cost-cutting company to discover it has no need for maintenance ! \nLocal regulators thought so too . \nAfter BP forced them to get a warrant to investigate , they found that the noncompliance rate was some 20 times higher than reported , as `` some tanker seals had extensive tears , tank roofs had pervasive leaks and there were enough major defects to lead to thousands of violations . '' \nTEXAS CITY 46-DAY TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE , APRIL 6 , 2010 This gave BP a choice : shut down the plant , which is time-consuming and expensive , or divert the gases to be burned off into carbon dioxide by a flare high above the ground . \nThe downside to the latter option is unburned emissions ; as ProPublica reported , `` Widely circulated industry guidelines assume that at least 2 percent of what is sent to a flare goes unburned and passes into the atmosphere . '' \nThat can quickly add up , so in most places the flare is used only in emergencies . \nBP diverted the gases to the flare for several weeks while they replaced the machinery , believing that they would be able to detect excess emissions . \nBut until June 4 , they had n't analyzed the data from their monitors and discovered that they had released hundreds of tons of chemicals into the air . \nThe company now estimates that 538,000 pounds of chemicals escaped from the refinery while it was replacing the equipment . \nThese included 17,000 pounds of benzene , a known carcinogen ; 37,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides , which contribute to respiratory problems ; and 186,000 pounds of carbon monoxide . \nEven by Texas 's relatively lenient air standards , that 's a problem . \nNORTH SLOPE PIG INCIDENT , JANUARY 15 , 2009 Pipeline inspection gauges , or `` pigs , '' are tools sent through pipes to clean and inspect them , propelled by the pressure of the oil\\/gas\\/etc . \nIn this case , a pig got stuck and lost , allowing gas to pass around it , which ended up `` causing a significant venting of gas to the atmosphere and the complete , temporary shutdown of the -LRB- Trans-Alaska Pipeline System -RRB- , '' the 800 mile artery connecting Alaska 's northern and southern coasts . \nTEXAS CITY VAPOR CLOUD , AUGUST 10 , 2005 A gas-oil leak at the Texas City refinery produced a vapor cloud that prompted a `` shelter-in-place '' order to be issued for the Texas City area , meaning residents are supposed to hunker down , put out any fires and take steps to avoid breathing any outside air . \nNo one was injured , so what makes this one of BP 's darkest days ? \nTwo things : It happened on the same day that an unrelated fire broke out at Chocolate Bayou , another Texas plant run by a BP subsidiary . \nThe fire required an emergency shutdown , and it would continue burning for two days . \nLocals were advised to stay indoors . \nThis leak came at the same Texas City location where a ruptured pipe had caused an explosion just two months earlier -LRB- also requiring a shelter-in-place order -RRB- , and where BP had suffered the deadliest accident in the company 's history just two months before that -- more on that later . \nPRUDHOE BAY GAS PIPELINE RUPTURE , SEPTEMBER 29 , 2008 A high-pressure natural gas pipeline in the great Alaskan field `` separated , '' sending 14-foot and 28-foot sections of the pipe flying 900 feet away from the line -- but fortunately , the gas itself did n't ignite . \n`` No one was hurt , but the official state report said the incident could have been catastrophic , '' The Wall Street Journal reported . \nBea , an engineering professor at U.C. Berkeley , is `` a well-known expert on catastrophes involving complex systems , '' who , at BP 's request , in 2002-03 studied their `` approach to catastrophic risk management at its U.S. facilities in Texas City , Prudhoe Bay , and Cherry Point , Washington , and made recommendations directly to John Browne , then CEO of BP , and other members of top management . '' \nAgain , timing is everything : half an hour later , an unrelated BP incident on another part of the North Slope caused a gas release . \nAnd these events happened more than two years after the next item on this list , the most consequential mistake BP has made on the Slope to date . \nTHE NORTH SLOPE 'S BIGGEST SPILL , MARCH 2 , 2006 As production from the Prudhoe Bay field on Alaska 's North Slope declined in the late 90s and early 2000s , BP slashed costs to compensate . \nDespite their Alaska operations being on probation for the first half of the decade after they pled guilty to illegal dumping at an offshore drilling field , a steady stream of complaints and investigations -LRB- both internally and by state inspectors -RRB- revealed that safety and maintenance were sacrificed to cut costs . \nThe neglect culminated in the largest spill ever recorded on the North Slope : more than 200,000 gallons -LRB- more than 5,000 barrels -RRB- of crude oil . \nBP was oblivious to the spill for five days until a field worker drove through the area and smelled the crude . \nThe leak issued from a dime-sized hole , but 16 miles of pipeline proved to be dangerously corroded ; replacing that pipe and installing a new leak-detection system cost BP half a billion dollars . \nYou might think that this incident would teach BP 's Alaskan management that cutting corners ultimately does n't pay . \nBut five months later , a safety technician contractor who had been complaining about pipeline inspectors faking their reports found himself canned after he pointed out a crack in a service pipe and halted some nearby work that was kicking up sparks . \nTEXAS CITY -- THE BIG EXPLOSION , MARCH 23 , 2005 The big explosion at the Texas City refinery in 2005 was only the most dramatic episode in the facility 's history of serious safety problems . \nDespite malfunctioning alarm systems , an octane-boosting unit was restarted , following which `` a distillation tower and attached blow down drum were overfilled with highly flammable liquid hydrocarbons , '' and when the blow down drum vented the liquids like a geyser into the air , it caused an explosion that was felt five miles away , which along with the resulting fires killed 15 and injured 170 . \nThe same blow down drum had vented these vapors eight times between 1994 and 2004 , and twice the system had caught fire . \nIn fact , the refinery experienced 40 to 80 fires a year , contributing to a sense of danger among the crew : A worker suggested in 2004 that to improve the plant , `` Quit waiting for a known possible unit disaster to happen before correcting the problem . '' \nA month before the explosion , another worker e-mailed management and warned , `` I truly believe that we are on the verge of something bigger happening . '' \nA record $ 21 million in fines followed . \nBP even failed to address these problems years later : in October 2009 , after a 6-month inspection , the Texas City refinery was found to have hundreds of `` egregious willful '' safety violations , earning them another $ 87.4 million in fines to eclipse the previous record . \nWhile the big Texas City explosion was the deadliest accident in BP 's history , it could have been a distant second or third . \nPRUDHOE BAY CENTRAL COMPRESSOR PLANT , OCTOBER 10 , 2009 This is a contingency BP plans for , but their system for handling this problem was n't operating , and BP did n't know it : A backup flare meant to burn off that collection of gas was not lit at the time , and cameras , installed so BP 's staff could monitor the flare 's functions in real time , were not pointed in the right direction . \nThere was no explosion ; the gas vented out before anything could ignite it . \nThat is , while BP monitors were unable to see that the pilot was out , a great buildup of gas escaped past it and fortunately was n't ignited by anything else . \nRobert Bea `` said the situation at the compressor station sounded like a ticking bomb . '' \n`` It 's hard to describe these explosions in terms that people can understand , '' he said . \n`` It would rival the biggest ones that we have ever had in the history of the oil and gas industry . '' \nBea said a blast zone could reach 300 feet and leave a crater 90 feet wide . \nHe likened the potential scenario to a gas valve error that led to the massive explosion of an offshore drilling platform called Piper Alpha in the North Sea in 1988 , in which 167 workers were killed . \nFORTIES ALPHA , NOVEMBER 27 , 2003 Another incident that resembled Piper Alpha was a near-catastrophe at another aging offshore rig in the North Sea called Forties Alpha , where BP had slashed the maintenance budget , leading them to break safety laws by failing to guard against corrosion on a gas pipe . \nAs reported in the Weekly Standard : ... -LRB- the -RRB- gas line had ruptured -- allowing thousands of pounds of pressurized gas to escape at supersonic velocity . \nThat caused a thunderous sonic boom . \nDebris from the burst pipe and its cladding rained down , adding to the impression that `` an artillery shell had just hit the platform . '' \nThe escaping gas quickly formed a huge and potentially lethal cloud around the rig . \nNow the threat of an actual explosion was very real . \nThe smallest spark would detonate more than a ton of methane gas . \nNo one died or was even hurt that day on Forties Alpha , thanks in part to high winds that helped to disperse the gas after about 20 minutes of extreme danger to the platform and its crew of 180 people . \nBP was fined $ 290,000 , and the company 's first calamity on an offshore rig was averted . \nFor a little while . \nIn a few short weeks when members of Congress return to Washington , it is vital they tackle this issue head on . \nLook specifically at BP 's record -- a clear deviation from the industry norm . \nThe stage has been set , the evidence laid out . \nIt is time to stop punishing the entire energy industry for the negligence of one player . \nFox Forum is on Twitter . \n"}

'' \nBP spokesman Justin Saia said the company had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment . \nAt least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the disaster . \nKing sued against the wishes of fellow Republican , Gov. Bob Riley , who hopes to reach an out-of-court settlement with the companies . \nBP was leasing the rig Deepwater Horizon from owner-operator Transocean Ltd. when it exploded and sank , killing 11 workers . \nHalliburton Energy Services Inc. , had been working to cap the well that ended up leaking with cement prior to the explosion . \nThe broken well spewed some 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf for three months before it was plugged . \nRiley spokesman Todd Stacy said the governor had not seen the lawsuits . \nHe said the state is still compiling a list of economic damages that it will submit to BP soon . \nIf the company does n't provide fair and fast compensation , then the state would have a dispute . \n`` When there is a dispute , then a lawsuit is appropriate , '' he said . \nKing said his move is not premature . \n`` As Alabama 's lawyer , I say that , if anything , based on BP 's broken promises , their history of saying one thing and doing another , and now , new information that they have been secretly working to gain a legal advance , further delay can only further damage our people , '' King said . \nHe said BP is retaining the best expert witnesses to keep the other side from using them to testify against BP and is selling assets perhaps to keep an American court from reaching them to satisfy a judgment . \nRiley appointed King as attorney general in 2004 . \nBut since then , they have become adversaries . \nRiley created the task force on gambling because King would n't take action against electronic bingo games at casinos . \nThey 've been battling it out in the courts over whether the task force has the authority to raid the casinos and seize the games . \nAs for the spill , a team of economic experts is still trying to put a figure on the state 's economic losses . \nKing will be out of office before the lawsuit makes much progress in court . \nHe lost the Republican primary June 1 to Birmingham lawyer Luther Strange . \nStrange said King should have consulted with the governor and Gulf coast mayors to make sure the litigation does n't hurt ongoing negotiations with BP . \nThe Democratic nominee for attorney general , Montgomery lawyer James Anderson , said King may have had a stronger case if he brought in Alabama cities and counties affected by the spill and possibly even other Gulf states . \nHe said BP has already lined up some of the top lawyers in the state , and the attorney general 's office will have to bring in outside lawyers with experience in this type of litigation if it hopes to win . \n`` We 've got plenty of time to add on attorneys , '' said Chris Bence , the attorney general 's chief of staff . \n"}

'' \nOn Friday , a group of activists staged an anti-BP demonstration next to the construction site where the university is building a new facility to house the research institute . \nThey poured chocolate syrup on the sidewalk -- to represent the oil spill -- and held signs the read `` Berkeley Petroleum '' and `` Do you want BP Pollution in Berkeley ? '' \n`` Now that we can see what BP is responsible for in the Gulf , we demand that the contract between UC and BP be re-looked at , '' activist Stephanie Tang said , speaking to onlookers through a megaphone . \nBut UC Berkeley officials say the institute has nothing to do with the Gulf spill , and the university has no plans to end its research partnership with BP . \n`` The horrible events in the Gulf should only strengthen our commitment to find alternatives to fossil fuels , '' said Graham Fleming , UC Berkeley 's vice chancellor of research . \n`` Why would anyone 's interest be served by stopping this research ? '' \nBP officials also say the company remains committed to funding the Berkeley-based research institute , as well as its other alternative energy research programs . \n`` The spill has n't changed our commitment to investing in biofuels and wind and solar development , '' said BP spokesman Tom Mueller . \nThe BP-Berkeley partnership has stirred debate about corporate funding of academic research at a time when UC is grappling with deep cuts in state funding that have led to faculty furloughs , course cutbacks and steep tuition hikes . \nCritics say corporate money steers university resources toward certain types of research , and widens the financial disparity between faculty members in science and engineering and those in the humanities and social sciences . \n`` It creates an apartheid within the university between the haves and have-nots , '' said Miguel Altieri , a UC Berkeley entomology professor who is concerned about the environmental impact of biofuels . \nHe recently wrote a newspaper article urging UC Berkeley officials to terminate the research partnership . \nUC Berkeley receives research grants from other corporations , mostly in the technology sector , but none are as big as the BP grant . \nPartnering with private industry helps university researchers get their ideas and discoveries out of the laboratory and into the real world , said UC 's Fleming . \nThe Energy Biosciences Institute funds nearly 70 projects involving about 350 researchers at UC Berkeley and its two partner institutions -- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . \nThe academic researchers determine what research to pursue , their participation is completely voluntary and their home institutions own the patents on their discoveries , university officials said . \n"}

'' \nHe also noted that Halliburton was responsible for encasing the well in cement , while Halliburton executive Tim Probert said his company 's work was completed 20 hours before the rig went up in flames . \nPresident Obama called the finger-pointing testimony a `` ridiculous spectacle . '' \nThe Justice Department has opened civil and criminal investigations into the spill . \nAttorney General Eric Holder has indicated that BP is n't the only company that could be held liable . \nKenneth Green , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research think tank , said the investigations may have stifled communications between the government and companies -- and between the companies themselves . \n`` The problem is you 've chilled communications with the very people you need to solve the problem , '' he said . \n`` Once the Justice Department got involved , the lawyers were basically immediately in charge of the show . '' \nBP is trying to move forward from the disaster that sent anywhere from 94 million to 184 million gallons of oil spewing into the Gulf , announcing once the cap was finally in place that its vilified chief executive , Tony Hayward , will be leaving in October . \nHe will be replaced by American Bob Dudley , who told reporters in Biloxi , Miss. , on Friday that it 's `` not too soon for a scaleback '' in the cleanup , and in areas where there is no oil , `` you probably do n't need to see people in hazmat suits on the beach . '' \nState waters closed by the spill have slowly reopened to fishing , most recently in Florida , where regulators on Saturday reopened a 23-mile area off of Escambia County to harvest saltwater fish . \nThe area was closed June 14 and remains closed to the shrimp and crab harvesting pending additional testing . \nOysters , clams and mussels were never included in the closure . \nIn Alabama , the Department of Public Health lifted all swimming advisories for the Gulf of Mexico . \nRelatively little oil remains on the surface of the Gulf , leaving less for thousands of oil skimmers to do , though Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser on Saturday offered to prove to Dudley that there 's still plenty of oil off the coast of Louisiana . \n`` Let me take him water-skiing out here and see if he comes up black , '' Nungesser said as he took a small group of reporters on a boat tour of an inlet at St. Mary 's Point , about an hour south of New Orleans . \nFresh globs of thick oil saturated the marshes and brownish tar balls were visible in the water . \nEven in areas where no oil was visible on the surface , workers were pulling up heavily stained boom that had been placed there in recent days . \nHundreds of lawsuits already have been filed in the aftermath of the explosion and spill . \nRig workers are suing their employers . \nIdled fishermen , coastal property owners and tourism-dependent businesses are suing the companies . \nEnvironmental lawyers are suing government regulators . \nSo far , the companies have n't sued each other . \nChristopher Ruppel , an energy expert and managing director of capital markets for the Execution Noble investment banking group , said the companies are probably waiting to get a full tally for the cleanup costs and a better read on the government probes . \nMeanwhile , he added , the companies are acting like `` porcupines working together .

'' \nThe volume of the spill , as well as the outcome of the containment efforts , will be key in determining the damage that the oil slick will have on the country 's most fertile seafood grounds . \nThe shrimp season begins in early May , as the shrimp move from estuaries out to sea , Long said . \nU.S. landings of shrimp were valued at $ 441.8 million in 2008 -- an increase of $ 9.1 million compared to 2007 . \nLouisiana leads the nation in its shrimp supply -- with 89 million pounds produced in 2008 -- followed by Texas , Alabama , Florida and Mississippi . \nHutchinson said that while the effect on wildlife and the fragile ecosystem along the coastline remains the `` area of biggest and immediate concern , '' officials are hoping that the travel and tourism industries in the region will not also be devastated by the oil spill . \nThe Gulf states play host to tourists from around the world , and industry officials acknowledge that the spill could have a massive economic impact . \nIn states like Florida , where tourism is a $ 65.5 billion industry , and Alabama , which brings in $ 6 billion , officials are closely monitoring any changes in hotel bookings and travel plans . \nMike Foster , vice president of marketing at the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau in Orange Beach , Ala. , said he spoke Wednesday with two major hotel and condominium partners and found few changes in reservations . \n`` There are very few cancellations '' at this time , he told FoxNews.com . \nOrange Beach , Ala. , saw about 1.3 million visitors from 2008 to 2009 , raking in $ 533 million in travel expenses , including food , lodging and recreation . \nFoster and Hutchinson both stressed that it is too early to speculate the impact , if any , of the oil slick on the travel and tourism industry . \n`` It 's a tragedy on so many different levels , '' Hutchinson said . \n`` As far as specific tourism concerns , none have been broached directly with me .

Sally Brice O'Hare said estimates are that oil could reach landfall in the Mississipi Delta region by late Friday . \nO'Hare spoke at a White House briefing on Thursday . \nPresident Obama is sending top officials from the EPA , and Departments of Homeland Security and Interior to help contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nFive times more oil a day than previously believed is spewing into the Gulf of Mexico from a blown-out well of a sunken drilling rig , the Coast Guard said . \nBP 's Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles also said more oil may be leaking from a Gulf of Mexico drilling site than first estimated . \nSpeaking Thursday on NBC 's `` Today , '' Suttles said the leak is more than the 1,000 barrels of day that was originally estimated last week after a deepwater rig exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana . \nHe said it may be as much as a new estimate of 5,000 barrels a day that the government first provided late Wednesday . \nSuttles said BP Plc and government scientists have to estimate the flow based on what reaches the surface because there is no way to measure the oil pouring out on the seabed . \nA new leak was discovered in the pipes a mile below the ocean 's surface . \nThe news came after crews tried a test burn on the massive spill to try to slow it from reaching the U.S. shoreline . \nAlso , the Secretary of Homeland Security has briefed President Obama on this new information and the government has offered to have the Department of Defense help contain the spill and protect the U.S. shoreline and wildlife , she said . \nMeanwhile , crews late Wednesday afternoon did a test burn on the massive spill , which Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry noted was successful . \nBP had planned to continue the oil fires after the test , but as night fell , no more were lit . \nThe burns were not expected to be done at night . \nNo details about when more were planned were given during the news conference . \nCrews planned to use hand-held flares to set fire to sections of the massive spill . \nThey turned to the plan after failing to stop the leak at the spot where a deepwater oil platform exploded and sank on April 20 . \nA 500-foot -LRB- 150-meter -RRB- boom was to be used to corral several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , which will then be towed to a more remote area , set on fire , and allowed to burn for about an hour . \nThe decision to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil on the sea bottom 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- below . \nGreg Pollock , head of the oil spill division of the Texas General Land Office , which is providing equipment for crews in the Gulf , said he is not aware of a similar burn ever being done off the U.S. coast . \nThe last time crews with his agency used fire booms to burn oil was a 1995 spill on the San Jacinto River . \n`` When you can get oil ignited , it is an absolutely effective way of getting rid of a huge percentage of the oil , '' he said . \nThe oil has the consistency of thick roofing tar . \nWhen the flames go out , Pollock said , the material that is left resembles a hardened ball of tar that can be removed from the water with nets or skimmers . \nAuthorities also said they expect minimal impact on sea turtles and marine mammals in the burn area . \nOfficials had estimated about 42,000 gallons -LRB- 160,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day was leaking into the Gulf from the blown-out well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . \nThat would be closer to 210,000 gallons -LRB- 800,000 liters -RRB- a day with the new estimates . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead and more than 100 escaped the blast , the cause of which has not been determined . \nA graphic posted by the Coast Guard and the industry task force fighting the slick showed it covering an area about 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- long and 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- across at its widest point . \n`` It 's premature to say this is catastrophic . \nI will say this is very serious , '' said Landry . \nFrom the air , the thickest parts of the spill resembled rust-colored tentacles of various thickness . \nThe air was thick with the acrid smell of petroleum . \nAmid several of the thicker streaks , four gray whales could be seen swimming in the oil . \nIt was not clear if the whales were in danger . \nMore than two dozen vessels moved about in the heart of the slick pulling oil-sopping booms . \nIn Plaquemines Parish , a sliver of Louisiana that juts into the Gulf and is home to Pass a Loutre , officials hoped to deploy a fleet of volunteers in fishing boats to spread booms that could block oil from entering inlets . \nBP says work will begin as early as Thursday to drill a relief well to relieve pressure at the blowout site , but that could take months . \nAnother option is a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but that will take two weeks to put in place , BP said . \nWinds and currents in the Gulf have helped crews in recent days as they try to contain the leak . \nThe immediate threat to sandy beaches in coastal Alabama and Mississippi has eased . \nBut the spill has moved steadily toward the mouth of the Mississippi River and the wetland areas east of the river , home to hundreds of species of wildlife and near some rich oyster grounds . \nThe cost of the disaster continues to rise and could easily top $ 1 billion . \nIndustry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700 million . \nBP has said its costs for containing the spill are running at $ 6 million a day . \nThe company said it will spend $ 100 million to drill the relief well . \nThe Coast Guard has not yet reported its expenses . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "541", "time": "2010-04-29", "text": "April 29 : Oil booms that were placed in preparation of the looming oil spill from last week 's collapse and spill of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig are seen strewn along the shoreline from choppy seas in Port Eads , La. . \nAP NEW ORLEANS -- An oil spill that threatened to eclipse even the Exxon Valdez disaster spread out of control and drifted inexorably toward the Gulf Coast on Thursday as fishermen rushed to scoop up shrimp and crews spread floating barriers around marshes . \nThe spill was both much bigger and closer than imagined -- five times larger than first estimated , with the leading edge just three miles from the Louisiana shore . \nAuthorities said it could reach the Mississippi River delta by Thursday night . \n`` It is of grave concern , '' David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told The Associated Press . \n`` I am frightened . \nThis is a very , very big thing . \nAnd the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it , especially if it continues on , are just mind-boggling . '' \nThe oil slick could become America 's worst environmental disaster in decades , threatening hundreds of species of fish , birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast , one of the world 's richest seafood grounds , teeming with shrimp , oysters and other marine life . \nThe leak from the ocean floor proved to be far bigger than initially reported , contributing to a growing sense among many in Louisiana that the government failed them again , just as it did during Hurricane Katrina . \nPresident Barack Obama dispatched Cabinet officials to deal with the crisis . \nCade Thomas , a fishing guide in Venice , worried that his livelihood will be destroyed . \nHe said he did not know whether to blame the Coast Guard , the federal government or oil company BP PLC. `` They lied to us . \nThey came out and said it was leaking 1,000 barrels when I think they knew it was more . \nAnd they were n't proactive , '' he said . \n`` As soon as it blew up , they should have started wrapping it with booms . '' \nThe Coast Guard worked with BP , which operated the oil rig that exploded and sank last week , to deploy floating booms , skimmers and chemical dispersants , and set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water 's surface . \nThe Coast Guard urged the company to formally request more resources from the Defense Department . \nA BP executive said the corporation would `` take help from anyone . '' \nGovernment officials said the blown-out well 40 miles -LRB- 60 kilometers -RRB- offshore is spewing five times as much oil into the water as originally estimated -- about 5,000 barrels , or 200,000 gallons , a day . \nAt that rate , the spill could easily eclipse the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- the 11 million gallons that leaked from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- in the three months it could take to drill a relief well and plug the gushing well 5,000 feet underwater on the sea floor . \nUltimately , the spill could grow much larger than the Valdez because Gulf of Mexico wells typically hold many times more oil than a single tanker . \nDoug Suttles , chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production , had initially disputed the government 's larger estimate . \nBut he later acknowledged on NBC 's `` Today '' show that the leak may be as bad as federal officials say . \nHe said there was no way to measure the flow at the seabed , so estimates have to come from how much oil rises to the surface . \nMike Brewer , 40 , who lost his oil spill response company in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina nearly five years ago , said the area was accustomed to the occasional minor spill . \nBut he feared the scale of the escaping oil was beyond the capacity of existing resources . \n`` You 're pumping out a massive amount of oil . \nThere is no way to stop it , '' he said . \nAn emergency shrimping season was opened to allow shrimpers to scoop up their catch before it is fouled by oil . \nCannons were to be used to scare off birds . \nAnd shrimpers were being lined up to use their boats as makeshift skimmers in the shallows . \nThis murky water and the oysters in it have provided a livelihood for three generations of Frank and Mitch Jurisich 's family in Louisiana . \nNow , on the open water just beyond the marshes , they can smell the oil that threatens everything they know and love . \n`` Just smelling it , it puts more of a sense of urgency , a sense of fear , '' Frank Jurisich said . \nThe brothers hope to get all the oysters they can sell before the oil washes ashore . \nThey filled more than 100 burlap sacks Thursday and stopped to eat some oysters . \n`` This might be our last day , '' Mitch Jurisich said . \nWithout the fishing industry , Frank Jurisich said the family `` would be lost . \nThis is who we are and what we do . '' \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday so officials could begin preparing for the oil 's impact . \nHe said at least 10 wildlife management areas and refuges in his state and neighboring Mississippi are in the oil plume 's path . \nThe declaration also noted that billions of dollars have been invested in coastal restoration projects that may be at risk . \nAs dawn broke Thursday in the oil industry hub of Venice , about 75 miles from New Orleans and not far from the mouth of the Mississippi River , crews loaded an orange oil boom aboard a supply boat at Bud 's Boat Launch . \nThere , local officials expressed frustration with the pace of the government 's response and the communication they were getting from the Coast Guard and BP officials . \n`` We 're not doing everything we can do , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , which straddles the Mississippi River at the tip of Louisiana . \nTension was growing in towns like Port Sulphur and Empire along Louisiana Highway 23 , which runs south of New Orleans along the Mississippi River into prime oyster and shrimping waters . \nCompanies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have facilities nearby , and some residents are hesitant to criticize BP or the federal government , knowing the oil industry is as much a staple here as fishing . \n`` I do n't think there 's a lot of blame going around here . \nPeople are just concerned about their livelihoods , '' said Sullivan Vullo , who owns La Casa Cafe in Port Sulphur . \nA federal class-action lawsuit was filed late Wednesday on behalf of two commercial shrimpers from Louisiana , Acy J. Cooper Jr. and Ronnie Louis Anderson . \nThe suit seeks at least $ 5 million in compensatory damages plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against Transocean , BP , Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and Cameron International Corp. . \nIn Buras , Louisiana , where Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005 , the owner of the Black Velvet Oyster Bar & Grill could n't keep his eyes off the television . \nNews and weather shows were making projections that oil would soon inundate the coastal wetlands where his family has worked since the 1860s . \nIt was as though a hurricane was approaching , maybe worse . \n`` A hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days , but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts , '' said Byron Marinovitch , 47 . \n`` We 're really disgusted , '' he added . \n`` We do n't believe anything coming out of BP 's mouth . '' \nSigns of the 2005 hurricane are still apparent here : There are schools , homes , churches and restaurants operating out of trailers , and across from Marinovitch 's bar is a wood frame house abandoned since the storm . \nA fleet of boats working under an oil industry consortium has been using booms to corral and then skim oil from the surface . \nThe Coast Guard abandoned a plan Wednesday to set fire to the leaking oil after sea conditions deteriorated . \nThe attempt to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil . \nAdm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was briefed Thursday on the issue , said his spokesman , Capt. John Kirby . \nBut Kirby said the Defense Department has received no request for help , nor is it doing any detailed planning for any mission on the oil spill . \nObama dispatched Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson to help with the spill . \nThe president said the White House would use `` every single available resource '' to respond . \nObama has directed officials to aggressively confront the spill , but the cost of the cleanup will fall on BP , White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said . \n"}

'' \nStuart Smith , an attorney handling oil-spill lawsuits , said seeking aid can be intimidating , and some cash workers fear that they 'll face penalties or prosecution for not paying taxes if they come forward . \n`` Proving that you worked in that capacity is going to be an issue for a lot of these people because they 're not sophisticated businessmen , '' Smith said . \nThat fear may be why it 's hard to find a laborer willing to talk about the problem . \nAlong Bayou Hopedale , east of New Orleans , a group of men sorting crabs at a ramshackle waterside building declined to answer questions recently . \nLess than a mile away , Christian Delos Reyes , who until the spill made a living dredging oysters , was helping prepare a boat for cleanup work . \nHe had documented his income and started the BP claims process , he said . \nBut he lamented the fate of others . \n`` A lot of them do n't pay taxes , '' he said . \nBP requests tax returns for 2007 through 2009 , but will work with individuals who want to provide other documentation , including wage loss statements , deposit slips , boat registrations , copies of current fishing licenses and other financial statements , the company said in a written response to questions about the process . \n`` BP will make every effort to keep claimant information confidential but will meet all of its legal obligations , '' the company statement said , adding it will report claims it pays to the IRS . \nKen Feinberg , appointed by the White House and BP to administer the aid fund , did n't hold out a lot of hope for people who take cash to avoid taxes . \nFeinberg administered a similar fund for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . \n`` I must say under the 9\\/11 fund , which was all public money , we were not sympathetic to paying claims based on cash-only , no tax returns , '' Feinberg said in an interview . \n`` You go down that road and you 're really opening up this fund to diversion to people who ca n't justify the claims , '' he said . \nStill , he added , President Barack Obama wants money to get to the people who are entitled to it . \n`` Maybe there 's some compromise we can reach , '' he said . \nIRS spokesman Eric Smith in Washington said the agency could not comment on the issues faced by workers who lack documentation . \nMeanwhile , the seafood industry has organized a charitable corporation to raise money for those who might fall through the cracks of the claims process . \nThe group does n't need the documentation required by BP or government agencies . \n`` We do n't even have an application process , '' said Kevin Voisin , the group 's head and an executive with Motivatit Seafood in Houma , La. . \nUsing a database of seafood-related companies in the Gulf region , volunteers are contacting managers and asking which workers need help , either because they have applied for aid that has n't arrived yet , lacked the documentation for an application or feared reprisal . \n`` We do n't need W2s . \nWe do n't need 1040s , '' Voisin said . \n`` We know the places that are shutting down . \nWe know the communities .

{"id": "184", "time": "2010-04-27", "text": "April 26 : Weathered oil is seen on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico near the coast of Louisiana . \nAP Apr. 21 : An oil slick is seen as the Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP BILOXI , Mississippi -- This time , it 's not a hurricane that threatens to wreck their livelihoods -- it 's a blob of black ooze slowly making its way toward the Gulf Coast . \nHotel owners , fishermen and restaurateurs are keeping anxious watch as an oil slick spreads from a wrecked drilling rig site like a giant filthy ink blot . \nForecasters say it could wash ashore within days near delicate wetlands , oyster beds and pristine white beaches . \nCrews have not been able to stop thousands of barrels of oil from spewing out of the sea floor since an April 20 explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon , which was drilling 50 miles off the Louisiana coast . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead , and the cause of the explosion has not been determined . \nLouis Skrmetta , 54 , runs a company called Ship Island Excursions that takes tourists to the Gulf Islands National Seashore , where white-sand beaches and green water create an idyllic landscape . \n`` This is the worst possible thing that could happen to the Mississippi Gulf Coast , '' he said . \n`` It will wipe out the oyster industry . \nShrimping would n't recover for years . \nIt would kill family tourism . \nThat 's our livelihood . '' \nAs crews struggled to contain the oil slick , Coast Guard officials said Tuesday they were considering setting fire to the contaminated water to burn off the crude . \nPools of oil far offshore would be trapped in special containment booms and set aflame as soon as Wednesday . \n`` If we do n't secure this well , this could be one of the most significant oil spills in U.S. history , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \nA similar burn off the coast of Newfoundland in 1993 eliminated 50 to 99 percent of captured oil . \nHowever , burning the oil also creates air pollution , and the effect on marine life is unclear . \nEd Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University who 's studying the oil spill , questioned whether burning would work . \n`` It can be effective in calm water , not much wind , in a protected area , '' he said . \n`` When you 're out in the middle of the ocean , with wave actions , and currents , pushing you around , it 's not easy . '' \nHe has another concern : The oil samples from the spill he 's looked at shows it to be a sticky substance similar to roofing tar . \n`` I 'm not super optimistic . \nThis is tarry crude that lies down in the water , '' he said . \n`` But it 's something that has got to be tried . '' \nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , birds and mammals are more likely to escape a burning area of the ocean than escape from an oil slick . \nThe agency said birds might be disoriented by the plumes of smoke , but they would be at much greater risk from exposure to oil in the water . \nIn Washington , meanwhile , the Obama administration launched a full investigation of the explosion , and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they will devote every available resource to the probe . \nMeanwhile , the glistening sheen of sweet crude continued to grow and began forming long reddish-orange ribbons of oil that , if they wash up on shore , could cover birds , white sand beaches and marsh grasses . \nThe last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . \nIt took until March 1980 to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated U.S. waters and Texas shores . \n`` In the worst-case scenario , this could also last months , '' said Richard Haut , a senior research scientist at the Houston Advanced Research Center who worked for Exxon for 20 years , 10 of them on an offshore platform in the North Sea . \nOil from the Deepwater Horizon is not expected to reach the coast until late in the week , if at all . \nAs of Tuesday , it was about 20 miles offshore , south of Venice , Louisiana . \nThe spill covered an expanding area about 48 miles long and 80 miles wide , but with uneven borders , making it difficult to calculate its area in square miles . \n`` I understand there 's got to be industry , but it 's so sad for our kids . \nWe do n't have a lot of beaches left , '' Bonnie Bethel , 66 , said as she watched her grandchildren splash in the water on a Mississippi beach . \n`` Can you imagine these poor birds in oil ? '' \nThousands of birds such as egrets and brown pelicans are nesting on barrier islands close to the rig 's wreckage right now . \nIf the oil gets to them , rescuers would need to reach their remote islands , wash them down and release them back into the wild . \nMichael Ziccardi , director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network affiliated with the University of California at Davis , said he is standing by to clean up Gulf Coast birds if they are hurt by the spill . \nCleaning up brown pelican chicks after a modest spill in Louisiana in 2005 was a major undertaking , he said . \n`` Just about any petroleum can cause problems for birds because they lose their waterproofing , and that 's what keeps them dry and warm , '' Ziccardi said . \n`` It 's a really difficult time , and we 're close to the peak of migration . '' \nThe spill also threatens billions of fish eggs and larvae coating the Gulf 's surface this time of year . \nIf the well can not be closed , almost 100,000 barrels of oil , or 4.2 million gallons , could spill into the Gulf before crews can drill a relief well to alleviate the pressure . \nBy comparison , the Exxon Valdez , the worst oil spill in U.S. history , leaked 11 million gallons into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . \nCrews working to clean up the spill from the Deepwater Horizon have other things in their favor . \nOil from the Exxon Valdez can still be found under rocks in the cold water of Prince William Sound , but residue in the Gulf will disappear faster . \n`` You have warm temperatures , strong sunlight , microbial action . \nIt will degrade a lot faster , '' said Ronald S. Tjeerdema , an environmental toxicologist at the University of California at Davis who 's studied the effects of oil on aquatic systems . \n`` Eventually , things will return to normal . '' \nAnd there 's another bit of good news : The oil spilling out is sweet crude , which is low in sulfur , unlike the oil from the Exxon Valdez , which was heavy crude . \n`` If you had to pick an oil to spill , this would be it , '' Overton , the LSU oil spill expert , said . \nBP said Tuesday that it planned to begin drilling a relief well to redirect the leaking oil in a $ 100 million effort to take the pressure off the blown-out well . \nThe company said it would begin the drilling by Thursday even if crews can shut off oil leaking from the pipe 5,000 feet underground . \nRobot subs have tried to activate a shut-off device , but so far that has not worked . \nCompany spokesman Robert Wine said the drilling will take up to three months and will be done from a rig now in place near where the Deepwater Horizon sank . \nLouisiana-based BP spokesman Neil Chapman said 49 vessels -- oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water -- are working to round up oil . \nIn Pensacola , Florida , the easternmost point likely to be affected , beachgoers and business owners kept watch . \n`` I 've been looking at this sand all morning and thinking about the oil spill , '' said Shelley Brunson after a morning swim at Pensacola Beach . \n`` I am praying they clean it up fast and it does n't come here . '' \nSal Pinzone , general manager of the fishing pier where anglers catch pompano and cobia , shows up at work at 5:30 every morning to watch the sun rise over the famous white-sand beach . \n`` We are all worried , '' he said . \n`` If the spill does hit the beaches along the Gulf , it will shut down everything .

' \nThen we 'll go back to these collections and say the average size of shrimp prior to the spill was this , '' Coddington said , surrounded by thousands of jars containing worms and other Gulf creatures preserved in alcohol in a suburban Maryland warehouse . \n`` It will come out which ever way it comes out . \nFacts help everybody . '' \nRequests for loans of specimens and other information about the Gulf creatures have spiked since the April 20 explosion on a drilling rig leased by BP PLC unleashed the spill , said collections manager Cheryl Bright . \nIt has also increased the urgency of efforts to catalog tens of thousands of specimens from the Gulf . \nThe collection includes more than 333,000 cataloged containers of invertebrates collected in the Gulf by the U.S. Minerals Management Service over the past 30 years . \nAnother 39,000 jars are partially inventoried , though as many as 120,000 more have n't been inventoried at all . \nThe MMS , which recently changed its name to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , is considering transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Smithsonian to help speed up the process , Coddington said . \nLast month , Coddington described the backlog to a House panel and told them it would cost $ 9 million to finish the inventory of all Gulf specimens . \nHe said in an interview the government has a responsibility to pay for the work . \n`` It 's not a silver bullet for understanding the impact of the oil spill . \nBut it 's a chunk of one , '' he said . \nThe MMS conducted environmental surveys of the waters for years , specifically to help predict the impact of future gas and oil explorations . \nThey began turning over the extensive collection to the Smithsonian for cataloging and safekeeping in 1979 . \nBiodiversity scientist Tom Shirley at Texas A&M 's Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies said the Smithsonian serves as a repository for the world 's ecosystems because its collection is so large . \nAs research funding and projects ramp up , he said , many samples will be pulled from the Gulf that will be unfamiliar species . \n`` The big question will always be what 's the species of those animals , '' he said . \n`` Some things are obvious : You can identify them from books and publications . \nOther things you ca n't . \nThe Smithsonian will come into play . '' \nShirley said one of his former students , Peter Etnoyer , is on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cruise in the Gulf to study deep sea corals after the oil spill . \nEtnoyer 's research draws extensively on on the Smithsonian 's coral collection . \nStill , scientists ca n't rely on the Smithsonian alone for a picture of the Gulf before the spill , said Monty Graham of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama . \nMarine centers in the region also have vast data on variations in plankton and other sea life from the days and years before the spill , for example . \n`` I think everybody needs to be asked what they have to contribute to painting this picture , '' Graham said . \n`` It 's a huge blank canvas .

Paul Zukunft said . \nBP 's Macondo well , currently plugged from gushing oil for the first time in three months , is located 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nThis is a developing story . \nRefresh page for updates . \nLast complete story appears below : MIAMI -- A tropical depression racing toward the Gulf of Mexico Thursday increased pressure on BP and the U.S. government to decide whether to evacuate dozens of ships at the site of the ruptured oil well . \nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said a cluster of thunderstorms in the Bahamas formed into a tropical depression Thursday morning . \nIt could reach the spill site within two and a half days , said Lexion Avila , a senior hurricane specialist . \nShe said they were awaiting an evacuation order for key vessels . \nWork on plugging the well is at a standstill just days before the expected completion of a relief tunnel to permanently throttle the free-flowing crude . \nWorse yet , the government 's spill chief said foul weather could require reopening the cap that has contained the oil for nearly a week , allowing oil to gush into the sea again for days while engineers wait out the storm . \n`` This is necessarily going to be a judgment call , '' said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who was waiting to see how the storm developed before deciding whether to order any of the ships to leave . \nBP spokesman Scott Dean said Thursday morning that no decisions had been made yet . \nCrews had planned to spend Wednesday and Thursday reinforcing with cement the last few feet of the relief tunnel that will be used to pump mud into the gusher and kill it once and for all . \nBut BP put the task on hold and instead placed a temporary plug called a storm packer deep inside the tunnel , in case it has to be abandoned until the storm passes . \n`` What we did n't want to do is be in the middle of an operation and potentially put the relief well at some risk , '' BP vice president Kent Wells said . \nIf the work crews are evacuated , it could be two weeks before they can resume the effort to kill the well . \nThat would upset BP 's timetable , which called for finishing the relief tunnel by the end of July and plugging the blown-out well by early August . \nScientists have been scrutinizing underwater video and pressure data for days , trying to determine if the capped well is holding tight or in danger of rupturing and causing an even bigger disaster . \nIf the storm prevents BP from monitoring the well , the cap may simply be reopened , allowing oil to spill into the water , Allen said . \nBP and government scientists were meeting to discuss whether the cap could be monitored from shore . \nAs the storm drew closer , boat captains hired by BP for skimming duty were sent home and told they would n't be going back out for five or six days , said Tom Ard , president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association in Alabama . \nIn Florida , crews removed booms intended to protect waterways in the Panhandle from oil . \nHigh winds and storm surge could carry the booms into sensitive wetlands . \nAlso , Shell Oil began evacuating empman for Transocean , the owner of the rig leased by BP , confirmed the existence of the reports to The Associated Press . \n`` As part of Transocean 's unwavering commitment to safety and rigorous maintenance discipline on all our rigs , we proactively commissioned the safety survey and the rig assessment review , '' Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said in an e-mail early Thursday . \n`` A fair reading of those detailed third-party reviews indicates clearly that while certain areas could be enhanced , overall rig maintenance met or exceeded regulatory and industry standards and the Deepwater Horizon 's safety management was strong and a culture of safety was robust on board the rig . '' \nThe `` Great Snowstorm '' came to an end . \nThis storm produced the heaviest snowfall over the largest area of any storm studied by weather historian David Ludlum . \nAccumulations exceeded 10 inches from the Ohio Valley across much of the Atlantic coast north of Georgia . \nWashington , DC reported 13 inches with 18 inches at Baltimore , Maryland , 18 to 36 inches near Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 15 to 20 inches at new York city , and 20 to 30 inches over southern New England . \nThe second severe arctic outbreak of the year hit the United States . \nA vast anticyclone from British Columbia to Louisiana , was centered over Kansas at 30.50 inches . \nThe zero line went into Texas with the temperature at Amarillo falling from 55 degrees to 1 degree below zero and Oklahoma city dropping from 62 degrees to 10 degrees . \nA winter storm produced 61 inches of snow at Rye , Colorado , and wind gusts to 100 mph in Utah . \nThe storm then spread heavy snow from the Texas Panhandle to Indiana . \nTulia , Texas received 16 inches of snow , and up to 14 inches blanketed western Oklahoma . \nA powerful Pacific storm battered the coast of southern California . \nWinds gusting to 65 mph uprooted trees in the San Diego area , while Los Angeles recorded a barometric pressure reading of 29.25 inches of mercury -- the lowest in 100 years of official record keeping . \nHeavy snow fell across the Prince Williams Sound area and the Susitna Valley of southern Alaska . \nValdez was buried under 64.9 inches of snow in less than two days , including a record 47.5 inches in 24 hours . \nUp to 44 inches of snow was reported in the Susitna Valley . \nThe heavy snow sank a half dozen vessels in the harbor . \nBitterly cold air prevailed across the great lakes and the northeastern U.S. Alpena , Michigan dipped to 28 degrees below zero to tie its record low for January . \nRochester , New York plunged to 17 degrees below zero for a new record low temperature for January . \nBoston , Massachusetts mean temperature for the day was only 2 degrees -- the city 's coldest day in 26 years . \nWatertown , New York was the cold spot in the nation , with a morning low of 43 degrees below zero . \nWilliston , North Dakota recorded 12.6 inches of snow in 24 hour for its greatest 24 hour snowfall on record . \nThe temperature plunged to 50 degrees below zero at Big Black River , Maine for the state 's coldest temperature on record . \n"}

'' \nBP , whose blown-out well has leaked as much as 180 million gallons of oil into the Gulf , was informed of the venture but it has n't joined , a spokesperson for Exxon said . \nBP did n't answer calls to comment about the new response system . \nThe British oil giant struggled for nearly three months to plug the well . \nIt tried dropping a metal containment box over the gusher and shooting garbage down the drill hole to block the oil from seeping out . \nAfter three months , a second containment cap now seems to be working after a smaller cap only captured some of the oil . \nAll these attempts were introduced with the caution that they 'd never been tried a mile underwater , where BP 's well was gushing oil . \nExxon and the other companies on Wednesday promised their equipment will be tested beforehand . \nThe new system draws on lessons learned from BP 's efforts and uses some similar equipment . \nThe companies say the equipment should n't break down under extreme pressures and depths . \nThe response system will include an array of underwater equipment designed to create a permanent connection and seal over a busted well . \nIt will separate oil from gas and bring it to the surface where the gas can be burned off and the oil can be stored on tankers . \nThe companies say the system could capture up to 100,000 barrels -- 4.2 million gallons -- of oil in depths of up to 10,000 feet , twice as deep as the waters BP was operating in . \nThe four were not involved in the Gulf oil spill , but each rely on offshore drilling to generate significant revenue . \nShell and Chevron have prominent drilling operations in the Gulf . \nThe system 's similarities to what BP has used concerns U.S. Rep. Edward Markey , D-Mass . \n, one of the harshest critics of the industry 's disaster planning . \nWhile the new system could be deployed rapidly , `` the oil companies must do better than BP 's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint , '' he said . \nHe said the announcement of the containment system could be a positive step , `` but it can not be the industry 's last , '' adding that what 's needed are technologies `` that will prevent fatal blowouts in the first place . '' \nRex Tillerson , chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil , who has been critical of BP 's handling of the well prior to the explosion , echoed that sentiment in a statement announcing the new system . \n`` If we all do our jobs properly , this system will never be used , '' he said . \n`` The extensive experience of industry shows that when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management , tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of Mexico today should not occur , '' Tillerson said . \nAfter numerous hearings on the safety of offshore drilling , the House passed legislation Wednesday that more than doubles the federal money for research in new cleanup methods and technologies . \nLawmakers passed a second bill that promotes research on devices like blowout preventers that can prevent accidents . \nAll deepwater exploration has come to a halt in the Gulf following the April 20 rig explosion . \nThe Obama administration has banned deepwater drilling until more research can be done on whether its safe for the environment . \nThe industry has warned of an exodus of rigs out of the Gulf , but so far that has n't happened . \nOnly two rigs , both owned by Diamond Offshore , have been moved to foreign waters . \n`` It 's not so simple moving a rig . \nIt takes a lot of time and money , '' Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said . \nAt the same time , once a rig does move from the Gulf it is n't likely to make a quick return , he said . \nAccording to their joint statement , the four companies will create a nonprofit organization called the Marine Well Containment Company to operate and maintain the response system . \nExxonMobil will lead the effort and other companies will be invited to participate . \nExxonMobil spokeswoman Karen Matusic said oil executives have been meeting over the past weeks to devise ways to handle another spill . \nAbout 40 engineers from the four companies have been working in Houston on this solution . \nExxon and its engineers have worked with BP on its spill response , but the British company was n't invited to join the new venture . \nBut the system would benefit if BP joined , Matusic said . \n`` Certainly BP can lend their expertise on what they 're discovering now as they 're containing the spill , '' she said . \n`` We certainly want to bring them in .

'' \nA top BP executive said there was no guarantee the company will get approval to go ahead with closing the cap , which is meant to be a temporary fix until the well is plugged from underground . \nChief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told The Associated Press in an interview that BP is trying to resolve the government 's concerns . \n`` I do n't know whether we will get that approval or not , '' Suttles said . \n`` I hope we do . '' \nAt the same time , BP on its own temporarily halted the drilling of two relief wells that are designed to plug the gusher permanently with cement and mud . \nThat work was halted for up to 48 hours as a precaution because it 's not yet clear what effect the testing of the new cap could have on it , the company said . \nThe delays were a stunning setback after the oil giant finally seemed to be on track following nearly three months of failed attempts to stop the spill , which has sullied beaches from Florida to Texas and decimated the multibillion dollar fishing industry . \nBP had zipped through weekend preparations and gotten the 75-ton cap in place Monday atop the well . \nThe plan was to stop the oil and pump excess to ships , raising hopes the gusher could be checked . \nBP was getting ready to test pressure on the well by closing valves in the cap when the government intervened late Tuesday . \nWord of the delay broke as video showed BP 's undersea robots busily swarming around the seafloor site . \nSuttles said the government wants to verify that the casing , or the piping in the well , is intact and that the oil would stay contained if BP shuts the well in . \nSuttles said the next step would depend on the outcome of a meeting of BP and government officials early Wednesday afternoon . \nGibbs said Energy Secretary Steven Chu , U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt and other government scientists have asked a series of questions to ensure that the integrity of the blowout preventer and the well itself are preserved . \n`` We want to conduct structural testing in order to make sure that the well is safe and secure , '' Gibbs told reporters at the White House . \nOil continued to spew nearly unimpeded into the water , with no clear timeline on when it would stop . \nBP shares were down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in London after recouping some of their oil spill losses earlier this week , when the cap project seemed to be moving ahead . \nThe cap would be a stopgap until a permanent fix that requires plugging the broken well underground with cement and heavy drilling mud , a more stable seal than capping the well from the top . \nThe timeline for the relief well and a backup one has always been hazy , with company and federal officials giving estimates ranging from the end of July to the middle of August before it can be completed . \nSuttles urged Gulf residents is to be patient . \n`` We 're going to get this thing stopped as fast as we can , '' he said . \n`` If it is not in the next couple of days with the test , we 'll do it with the relief wells . '' \nOn the Alabama coast , Joyce Nelson said every bit of news from the spill site increases her stress and sparks a new round of telephone calls between friends and relatives in Bayou La Batre , where the seafood industry is virtually shut down because of the spill . \nThe slowdown at the rig site just made things worse . \n`` Everybody 's calling everybody . \nIt 's hectic , '' said Nelson . \n`` Everybody is worried about them blowing the whole thing out . \nIf that happens , there 's nothing they can do but let it drain out . '' \nRoger N. Anderson , a marine geologist at Columbia University , said he believes BP and government scientists are just being very cautious and he 's not worried . \nFreezing work on the relief well may mean scientists are worried that clamping down the cap will push new pressure all the way down to the depths of the broken well , he said . \n`` So I would n't panic , is the answer . \nThey 're going to be very , very deliberate about this , '' Anderson said . \nAssuming BP gets the green light to do the cap testing after the extra analysis is finished , engineers need to shut off lines already funneling some oil to ships to see how the cap handles the pressure of the crude coming up from the ground . \nFinally , they would shut the openings in the 75-ton metal stack of pipes and valves gradually , one at a time , while watching pressure gauges to see if the cap would hold or if any new leaks erupted . \nThe operation could last anywhere from six to 48 hours , once it gets started . \nAs of Wednesday , the 85th day of the disaster , between 92 million and 182 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \n"}

'' \nNational Incident Commander Thad Allen met with the federal energy secretary and the head of the U.S. Geological Survey as well as BP officials and other scientists after the mapping was done . \n`` As a result of these discussions , we decided that the process may benefit from additional analysis , '' Allen said in a statement . \nHe did n't specify what type of analysis would be done , but said work would continue until Wednesday . \nAssuming BP gets the green light to do the cap testing after the extra analysis is finished , engineers need to shut off lines already funneling some oil to ships to see how the cap handles the pressure of the crude coming up from the ground . \nFinally , they would shut the openings in the 75-ton metal stack of pipes and valves gradually , one at a time , while watching pressure gauges to see if the cap would hold or if any new leaks erupted . \nThe operation could last anywhere from six to 48 hours , once it gets started . \nScientists will be looking for high pressure readings of 8,000 to 9,000 pounds per square inch . \nAnything lower than 6,000 might indicate previously unidentified leaks in the well . \nThe oil giant was optimistic about the latest effort after other attempts failed , and White House officials earlier expressed optimism Tuesday . \nBut BP has said all along they were working carefully so as to not jeopardize the effort to stop the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history and one of the nation 's worst environmental disasters . \nIf the cap works , it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding all the oil inside the well machinery like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channeling some though pipes to as many as four collection ships . \nEarlier , Allen stressed there were no guarantees on the latest measure and urged patience from Gulf residents . \nAlong the Gulf Coast , where the spill has heavily damaged the region 's vital tourism and fishing industries , people anxiously awaited the outcome of the painstakingly slow work . \n`` I do n't know what 's taking them so long . \nI just hope they take care of it , '' said Lanette Eder , a vacationing school nutritionist from Hoschton , Ga. , who was walking on the white sand at Pensacola Beach , Fla. `` I ca n't say that I 'm optimistic -- It 's been , what , 84 days now ? \n-- but I 'm hopeful , '' said Nancy LaNasa , 56 , who runs a yoga center in Pensacola . \nThe cap is just a stopgap measure . \nTo end the leak for good , the well needs to be plugged at the source . \nBP is drilling two relief wells through the seafloor to reach the broken well , possibly by late July , and jam it permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement . \nAfter that , the Gulf Coast faces a long cleanup . \nThe leak began after the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nAs of Tuesday , the 84th day of the disaster , between 90.4 and 178.6 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf . \n"}

'' \nBP spokesman Daren Beaudo emphasized to FoxNews.com that the company has no plans to develop the reservoir . \n`` We 're focused 100 percent on the job at hand , which is killing the well , cleaning up the oil and restoring the Gulf Coast economy , '' he said . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill , said he had no information on BP 's future plans . \n`` I would assume that 's a policy issue related to the management of the lease , '' he told reporters . \n`` Frankly , it has n't been raised to my level at this point . \nI 'm not sure I can comment on it . '' \nA senior official with the Interior Department told FoxNews.com that the agency has had no communications with BP about drilling in the reservoir . \n`` It is too premature to talk or even speculate about them drilling there , '' the official said . \nSuttles has spent more than three months managing BP 's response efforts on the Gulf but is now returning to his day job in Houston , the company said . \nMike Utsler , a vice president who has been running BP 's command post in Houma , La. , since April , will replace him . \nThe personnel shift comes as BP appears to be gaining the upper hand on plugging the leak . \nEngineers this week poured in cement to complete a plug at the top of the well bore as part of a process dubbed a `` static kill , '' but they needed to wait at least a day for the cement to harden . \nOnce it does , crews can finish the last stretch of a relief well intersecting the blown well just above the oil 's source , injecting more mud and cement from the bottom to form a final plug . \nSuttles confirmed Friday that crews for now plan to use the 18,000-foot relief well to seal off with mud and cement the underground reservoir feeding the blown well . \nThe company had been hedging on how exactly it would use the relief well , which it has been digging for three months , as federal officials insisted it should be used to perform the so-called `` bottom kill . '' \nIf not used for the bottom kill , the relief wells could have conceivably offered a way for BP or another company to pump oil from the reservoir and sell it , an idea unlikely to sit well with Gulf Coast residents and families of workers who died on the rig . \nThe static kill started Tuesday with engineers pumping enough mud down the top of the well to push the crude back to its underground source . \nSuttles said engineers plan to monitor the cement newly pumped in from the top and test the plug to make sure it 's sealed . \n`` All the indications so far look very encouraging , '' he said . \nA federal report this week indicated that only about a quarter of the spilled crude remains in the Gulf and is degrading quickly . \n`` There 's essentially no skimmable oil left on the surface , no recoverable oil left on the surface , '' Suttles said . \nSome scientists disputed the report 's veracity , and much of the remaining crude has permeated deep into marshes and wetlands , complicating cleanup . \nBP had 31,000 workers along the Gulf on Friday , down from 48,000 at the height of the response , Suttles said . \nAs BP pulled brought in 33-year employee Utsler to take over the response and the blown well appeared to have flatlined , some Gulf residents who still see the oil wreaking havoc worried the nation 's attention was shifting . \nUtsler told them not to worry , saying the spill 's effects are `` a challenge that we continue to recognize with more than 20,000-plus people continuing to work . '' \nWillie Davis , a 41-year-old harbormaster in Pass Christian , Miss. , feared his area would be forgotten if BP pulls out too soon . \n`` I 'm losing trust in the whole system , '' Davis said . \n`` If they do n't get up off their behinds and do something now , it 's gonna be years before we 're back whole again .

Bob Riley 's face lit up when he heard the oil flow had stopped . \n`` That 's great . \nI think a lot of prayers were answered today , '' he said . \nPresident Barack Obama called it a positive sign , but cautioned : `` We 're still in the testing phase . '' \nStephon LaFrance , an oysterman in Louisiana 's oil-stained Plaquemines Parish who has been out of work for weeks , called it a lie . \n`` I do n't believe they stopped that leak . \nBP 's trying to make their self look good , '' he said . \nThen a waiting period began . \nEngineers will monitor pressure gauges and watch for signs of leaks elsewhere in the well . \nThe biggest risk : Pressure from the oil gushing out of the ground could fracture the well and make the leak even worse . \nHigh pressure is good because it shows there 's only a single leak . \nLower pressure could mean more leaks farther down in the well . \nBP expects to keep the oil trapped in the cap for 48 hours before it decides if the approach is working . \nThe stoppage came 85 days , 16 hours and 25 minutes after the first report of the Deepwater Horizon explosion . \nSomewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nBP said the oil stopped flowing into the water at 2:25 p.m. CDT after engineers gradually dialed down the amount of crude escaping through the last of three valves in the cap . \nThe $ 20 billion that BP has set aside to pay for losses caused by the spill will start making payments in early August . \nKen Feinberg , who is in charge of paying individuals and businesses for lost income , told government officials in Louisiana on Thursday that he expected a seamless transition from BP management to his . \nBP has 35 offices in the Gulf Coast area accepting claims . \nBP 's use of chemicals to disperse the oil has come under renewed scrutiny . \nThe company has used at least 1.8 million gallons of dispersants on the Gulf 's surface and 5,000 feet deep at the source of the leak . \nEarthjustice has filed a federal lawsuit in Florida to force the Environmental Protection Agency to turn over safety studies on the chemicals . \nBP says the chemicals have kept much of the spill from reaching the Gulf coast . \nBiologists say oil has smeared at least 300 to 400 pelicans and hundreds of terns in the largest seabird nesting area along the Louisiana coast , a sharp escalation in wildlife harmed by BP 's Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nThe finding underscores that official tallies of birds affected by the spill could be significantly underestimating the scope of damage . \nThe government counts only oiled birds collected for rehabilitation or found dead . \nOiled birds in the many nesting areas that dot the Gulf coast typically are left in place and not counted in official tallies . \nA government investigation of the deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is to resume next week . \nThe Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement have scheduled five more days of hearings , from July 19-23 , in a New Orleans suburb . \nA panel of officials from each agency heard six days of testimony in May from rig workers , company executives , government regulators and others . \nA witness list for next week 's hearings was n't immediately released . \nA House panel approved legislation Thursday to overhaul the government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling . \nThe bill would divide the agency into three parts : one for leasing and permitting ; another for inspections and investigations ; and a third to collect revenue . \nThe first group of sea turtles that are part of a sweeping effort to save threatened and endangered hatchlings from death in the oily Gulf of Mexico have been released into the Atlantic Ocean . \nFifty-six endangered Kemp 's ridley turtles were released on a beach at Florida 's Canaveral National Seashore this week , the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Thursday . \n"}

{"id": "1756", "time": "2010-07-15", "text": "July 14 : Underwater robots are seen working at the site of the BP leak in the Gulf . \nBP , via Reuters NEW ORLEANS -- BP engineers were back to the slow work of trying to choke the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher with an untested cap after replacing a leaky pipe Thursday , the latest delay in the uncertain fix . \nKent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said at a news briefing in Houston that the overnight leak in a pipe on the side of the towering , 75-ton capping stack was fixed by replacing the assembly , called a `` choke line . '' \nThe work sent the oil giant back to restarting preparations for testing whether the cap can stop the oil without blowing a new leak in the well . \nIf it works , the cap will be a temporary fix until BP can drill into the gusher to plug it for good from underground , where the seal will hold better . \n`` Bear with us , '' Wells said . \nThe leak was discovered after two of the three valves on the cap that can open or shut the device had been closed , bringing BP and government scientists , who are also watching , tantalizingly close to starting a 48-hour test of how the well and cap withstand the pressure . \nWells had warned that the process of getting ready and then choking the oil a mile below the sea , at a depth only submarine robots can reach , consisted of many precise , individual steps . \n`` Any one of these steps can take longer than anticipated , '' Wells said Wednesday , before the leak disrupted work . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the disaster , said at a briefing it 's not clear yet whether the cap , which was mounted on the well Monday , will ultimately be used to shut in the oil or to channel it through pipes to collection ships overhead . \n`` I have a high degree of confidence we can substantially decrease the oil coming into the environment , '' Allen said . \nThe cap remains a temporary fix , he said , until one of two relief wells BP is drilling can reach the gusher underground and plug it permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement . \n`` Make no mistake , the number one goal is to kill the well ... to stop it at the source , '' he said . \nThe test will involve closing off all three openings in the cap to the Gulf , in theory stopping the oil leaking into the Gulf . \nBP will be monitoring pressure under the cap . \nHigh pressure is good , because it shows there 's only a single leak . \nLow pressure , below 6,000 pounds per square inch or so , could mean more leaks farther down in the well . \nBP expects to keep the oil trapped in the cap for 48 hours before it decides if the approach is working . \nWith the leaking pipe replaced , BP had to start from a few steps back to resume preparations for the test . \nPreparations included letting more oil pour out of the cap temporarily and turning off a pipe that had been sending some of the oil to a collection ship , so that the full force of all the erupting crude would go into the cap . \nEngineers also had to recheck equipment and move undersea robots that perform the work back into position . \nWells was hesitant to give a firm timeframe for when the test could start , but expected it to be Thursday . \n`` We 're going to keep moving forward with this , '' Wells said . \nAllen said a committee of scientists and engineers will monitor the results and assess every six hours , and end the test after 48 hours to evaluate the findings . \n`` I was gung-ho for this test and I remain gung-ho for this test , '' he said Wednesday . \nIf the cap works , it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding all the oil inside the well machinery like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channeling some through lines to as many as four collection ships . \nAllen said the testing will also help prepare for the hoped-for permanent fix by the relief wells . \nThe mapping of the sea floor that was done to prepare for the cap test and the pressure readings will also help them determine how much mud and cement will be needed to seal off the well underground . \nDrill work was stopped on one relief well because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it . \nWork on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan . \nThe government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons are leaking every day . \nAs of Thursday , the 86th day of the disaster , between 93.5 million and 184.3 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \n"}

'' \nEngineers will be watching pressure readings . \nHigh pressure is good , because it would mean the leak has been contained inside the wellhead machinery . \nBut if readings are lower than expected , that could mean there is another leak elsewhere in the well . \n`` Another concern right now would be how much pressure the well can take , '' and whether intense pressure would further damage the well , said Eric Smith , associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute . \nEven if the cap works , the blown-out well will still be leaking . \nBut the newer , tighter cap will enable BP to capture all the oil , or help funnel it up to ships on the surface if necessary . \nOne of those ships , the Helix Producer , began operating Monday and should be up to its capacity of collecting roughly 1 million gallons of oil a day within a few days , Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . \nA permanent fix will have to wait until one of two relief wells being drilled reaches the broken well , which will then be plugged up with drilling mud and cement . \nThat may not happen until mid-August . \nMeanwhile , the Obama administration issued a revised moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling Monday to replace the one that was struck down by the courts as heavy-handed . \nThe new ban , in effect until Nov. 30 , does not appear to deviate much from the original moratorium , as it still targets deep-water drilling operators while defining them in a different way . \nWork on the new capping operation began Saturday with the removal of a leaky cap that captured about 1 million of the 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons of oil the government estimates is spilling from the well every day . \nGulf residents closely watched the operation , knowing the damage already done to the biologically rich Gulf and the coast 's two leading industries , fishing and tourism . \n`` I think we 're going to see oil out in the Gulf of Mexico , roaming around , taking shots at us , for the next year , maybe two , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Louisiana 's oil-stained Plaquemines Parish . \n`` If you told me today no more oil was coming ashore , we 've still got a massive cleanup ahead . '' \nBP `` ca n't do much , but they know how to drill wells , '' dock master Jimmy Beason said at a marina in Orange Beach , Ala. `` I think that by the end of the month it will be stopped , and this work with the cap is part of it . \nI see the light at the end of the tunnel . '' \nAs of Monday , the 83rd day of the disaster , between 89 million and 176 million gallons of oil had poured into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nThe spill started April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon rig , leased by BP from Transocean Ltd , exploded and burned , killing 11 workers . \nIt sank two days later . \n"}
{"id": "1848", "time": "2010-07-12", "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration issued a new moratorium Monday on deep-water offshore drilling that is no longer based on water depth and stresses new evidence of safety problems , hoping the revised ban will pass muster with the courts after the initial one was rejected . \n`` More than 80 days into the BP oil spill , a pause on deep-water drilling is essential and appropriate to protect communities , coasts , and wildlife from the risks that deep-water drilling currently pose , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in announcing the new moratorium . \n`` I am basing my decision on evidence that grows every day of the industry 's inability in the deep-water to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill , and to operate safely . '' \nThe new moratorium was panned by industry groups and supported by environmentalists . \nLast week , a federal appeals court rejected the government 's effort to restore its initial offshore deep-water drilling moratorium , which was issued after the catastrophic Gulf oil spill in April . \nThe moratorium was blocked first last month by U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman . \nThe Justice Department said Monday that it will file a motion with the U.S. District Court seeking a dismissal of that case , because the old moratorium is no longer operative , making the challenge moot . \nThe department also will ask the appeals court to set aside Feldman 's order of last month . \nThe Interior Department said that like the original ban , this one applied to most deep-water drilling activities . \nThe department also said the suspensions in the new moratorium `` are the product of a new decision by the secretary and new evidence regarding safety concerns , blowout containment shortcomings within the industry , and spill response capabilities that are strained by the BP oil spill . '' \nThe new moratorium also establishes a process to gather and analyze new information on safety and response issues , which could allow for identifying conditions to resume certain deep-water drilling activities . \nUnlike the last moratorium , which applied to waters of more than 500 feet -LRB- 150 meters -RRB- , the new one applies to any deep-water floating facility with blowout preventers . \nThe National Ocean Industries Association , an industry trade group for offshore production , said that while the new moratorium does not apply to anchored facilities using surface blowout preventers , `` such facilities are generally used in shallow water , which makes the new suspension glaringly similar , if not even more restrictive than the original moratorium . \nIt is not immediately clear how many facilities will be impacted . '' \nIn a Question & Answer document , the Interior Department said any count represents a snapshot in time . \nThe document said that at the time of the BP spill , there were 36 floating drilling rigs that would have been affected by the new ban . \nIt was unclear whether the new moratorium would be more or less restrictive than the original one . \nThe offshore industry also complained that while the new moratorium opens the door to lifting the restrictions if industry provides assurance for adequate containment and response , `` The problem for industry is that it is unclear what exactly it will take to convince the administration that such capability exists . \nIn a memo to Michael Bromwich , the new head of the department 's agency that oversees offshore drilling , Salazar said that the moratorium will give industry time to come up with more effective blowout containment strategies and capabilities for deep-water operations . \n`` I can not conclude at this time that deep-water drilling can move forward in a safe and environmentally sound manner , '' he wrote . \nSalazar also said that one factor in having the moratorium go through Nov. 30 is that hurricane season runs through that date . \n`` During this time of year , as we have already seen this year , the ability to contain and respond to a spill is often compromised by weather conditions , '' Salazar wrote . \nOther industry groups and pro-drilling lawmakers also criticized the new moratorium . \n`` It is unnecessary and shortsighted to shut down a major part of the nation 's energy lifeline while working to enhance offshore safety , '' said Jack Gerard , president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute . \n`` The new moratorium threatens enormous harm to the nation and to the Gulf region . '' \nSen. Mary Landrieu , a Democrat representing Louisiana in the Senate , said in testimony to the presidential oil spill panel that she was `` alarmed '' at the Interior Department 's statement that its decision is supported `` by an extensive record of existing and new information indicating that allowing new deep-water drilling to commence would pose a threat of serious , irreparable , or immediate harm or damage to the marine , coastal and human environment . '' \nLandrieu said that statement `` contradicts testimony given by drilling experts and ignores the history of oil and gas operations in the Gulf . '' \nLawyers for the companies that sued to block the moratorium did not immediately return calls for comment . \nTodd Hornbeck , CEO of Covington-based Hornbeck Offshore Services , one of the plaintiff companies , said he did not know how the new moratorium would affect deep-water drilling projects . \n`` I 've got to review it first , '' he said . \nMeanwhile , environmental groups expressed support . \nCatherine Wannamaker , a lawyer for several environmental groups that support the moratorium , said the new one does not appear to be any less restrictive than the first one . \n`` We continue to believe it 's a necessary safety precaution , '' she said . \n`` The first moratorium was a rational decision made by -LRB- Salazar -RRB- and should have withstood judicial scrutiny . \nThe new moratorium makes -LRB- his -RRB- reasoning more explicit and is a step in the right direction . '' \nJacqueline Savitz , senior campaign director for Oceana , an international ocean conservation group , said the administration had no other choice . \n`` We commend the president for putting more drilling on hold , '' she said . \n"}

'' \nNearly 60 pelican chicks and more than 600 adults were brought to Fort Jackson in June after oil washed onto a rookery on Queen Bess and other nearby islands in coastal Louisiana . \nThey 're among more than 1,000 oiled birds and more than 100 oiled sea turtles rescued since the BP-leased rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nAbout three-quarters of the birds and all but a handful of turtles have been cleaned in Louisiana . \nAll but two of the sea turtles -- a 150-pound oiled loggerhead dubbed Big Mama and an 85-pound loggerhead that was sick but free of oil -- are juveniles , ranging from saucer - to dinner-plate size . \nDoses of fluids , antibiotics and a mix of cod-liver oil and mayonnaise used to help break up the oil they 've swallowed are administered based on the animal 's weight . \nBut the basic treatment is the same . \n`` The difference is it takes five people to lift Big Mama and her sister . \nIt only takes one person to lift the little guys , '' said Michele Kelley , Louisiana 's sea turtle and marine mammal stranding coordinator . \nBaby turtles leave their sandy nests and head straight for the sea knowing everything a turtle needs to know . \nChicks need far more care . \nKeeping them warm can be the biggest challenge , and tern chicks are among the hardest to keep alive because they 're so small , said IBRRC staffer Mark Russell . \nThe birds lose body heat through their skin , and smaller animals have more skin in proportion to their size than larger creatures . \nSome of the tern chicks are smaller than a tennis ball . \nThe chicks also tend to be dehydrated and malnourished . \n`` If they 're dehydrated , they do n't want to eat because they feel sick , '' Russell said . \nAnd they 're so small that it 's hard to keep a tube down their throats to give water and liquid food . \nIn the week he 'd been in Louisiana , he knew of two or three tern chicks that died , Russell said Friday . \nOnce a chick is eating on its own , staff have as little contact with it as possible . \n`` We do n't want to be raising what is commonly referred to as a pier rat , '' said Wendy Fox , director of Pelican Harbor Seabird Station , the Miami rehabilitation center where the pelican chicks were moved Saturday . \nThe babies will be housed next to adult `` role models , '' and eventually with adults , Fox said . \nTheir pens also have pools deep enough to dive for fish . \nPelicans take five to six months to reach independence . \nAt Fort Jackson , one of the youngsters perched alongside a pool and flapped its wings energetically . \n`` See that ? '' \n`` He 's almost ready to learn to fly ! '' \n"}

'' \nThe rig was disconnected from the spill site ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie , which later weakened to a tropical depression . \n`` The assessment was made that the storm intensity has decreased , '' Ferguson said . \n`` So the decision was made overnight to return the DD3 . '' \nIn anticipation of the storm , ships working at the oil spill site moved to safer waters and coastal workers packed up oil removal operations . \nThe storm now seems a less likely threat to cleanup , but is expected to bring periods of heavy rainfall , strong winds , and dangerous surf to the Gulf states . \nBonnie could reach the northern Gulf Coast tonight or early tomorrow after passing over the oil spill midday Saturday . \nThe center of Bonnie came ashore Friday near Cutler Bay , about 20 miles south of Miami . \nIt moved into the eastern Gulf and was about 215 miles east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River at 8 a.m. EDT Saturday . \nThough officials along the coast expressed frustration at the sudden halt to cleanup and containment , several said they saw no choice , given the looming arrival of bad weather . \nThe mechanical cap that has mostly contained the oil for eight days was left closed , and there was no worry the storm could cause any problems with the plug because it 's nearly a mile below the ocean 's surface . \n`` Preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priorities , '' said Allen , the federal government 's spill chief who ordered the evacuation of most ships 40 miles from the Louisiana coast With many of the protective barriers that had been shielding Louisiana 's coastal marshes locked away in warehouses , oil began to seep into fragile ecosystems that had been relatively unscathed ; the black blotches were visible in the waters off St. Bernard Parish , just east of New Orleans 's French Quarter , The Wall Street Journal reported . \n`` We ca n't do anything about it , '' said parish spokeswoman Jennifer Belsom about current skimming operations . \nBut she expects them to resume Monday . \nWorkers on land readied for a possible storm surge that could push oil into the sensitive marsh areas along the coast . \nOn the tiny resort island of Grand Isle off the southeast Louisiana coast , workers packed up the oil removal operation , tearing down tents , tying down clean boom and loading oil-soaked boom into large containers so it wo n't pollute the area if the storm causes flooding . \n`` We 're planning for a 2-to-3-foot storm surge so anything that would be affected by that is being moved or stored , '' said Big Joe Kramer , 55 , who is working on his fourth large spill for Miller Environmental Services , Inc. . \nAt the spill site , the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar . \nBut the oil is still there beneath the surface , staining the hulls of boats motoring around in it . \nThe evacuation could delay the relief well for as long as two weeks , pushing back the attempt to definitively shut down the leak by intercepting the well to late August , BP officials said . \nBut an attempt to flood the well with drilling mud and cement could be tried shortly after the ships get back to the drilling site , Allen said . \nBefore the cap was attached and closed a week ago , the broken well spewed 94 million gallons -LRB- 355 million liters -RRB- to 184 million gallons -LRB- 696 million liters -RRB- into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nThe plug is so far beneath the ocean surface , scientists say even a severe storm should n't damage it . \n`` There 's almost no chance it 'll have any impact on the well head or the cap because it 's right around 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- deep and even the largest waves wo n't get down that far , '' said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of professional geoscience programs at the University of Houston . \nThe `` Great Snowstorm '' came to an end . \nThis storm produced the heaviest snowfall over the largest area of any storm studied by weather historian David Ludlum . \nAccumulations exceeded 10 inches from the Ohio Valley across much of the Atlantic coast north of Georgia . \nWashington , DC reported 13 inches with 18 inches at Baltimore , Maryland , 18 to 36 inches near Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 15 to 20 inches at new York city , and 20 to 30 inches over southern New England . \nThe second severe arctic outbreak of the year hit the United States . \nA vast anticyclone from British Columbia to Louisiana , was centered over Kansas at 30.50 inches . \nThe zero line went into Texas with the temperature at Amarillo falling from 55 degrees to 1 degree below zero and Oklahoma city dropping from 62 degrees to 10 degrees . \nA winter storm produced 61 inches of snow at Rye , Colorado , and wind gusts to 100 mph in Utah . \nThe storm then spread heavy snow from the Texas Panhandle to Indiana . \nTulia , Texas received 16 inches of snow , and up to 14 inches blanketed western Oklahoma . \nA powerful Pacific storm battered the coast of southern California . \nWinds gusting to 65 mph uprooted trees in the San Diego area , while Los Angeles recorded a barometric pressure reading of 29.25 inches of mercury -- the lowest in 100 years of official record keeping . \nHeavy snow fell across the Prince Williams Sound area and the Susitna Valley of southern Alaska . \nValdez was buried under 64.9 inches of snow in less than two days , including a record 47.5 inches in 24 hours . \nUp to 44 inches of snow was reported in the Susitna Valley . \nThe heavy snow sank a half dozen vessels in the harbor . \nBitterly cold air prevailed across the great lakes and the northeastern U.S. Alpena , Michigan dipped to 28 degrees below zero to tie its record low for January . \nRochester , New York plunged to 17 degrees below zero for a new record low temperature for January . \nBoston , Massachusetts mean temperature for the day was only 2 degrees -- the city 's coldest day in 26 years . \nWatertown , New York was the cold spot in the nation , with a morning low of 43 degrees below zero . \nWilliston , North Dakota recorded 12.6 inches of snow in 24 hour for its greatest 24 hour snowfall on record . \nThe temperature plunged to 50 degrees below zero at Big Black River , Maine for the state 's coldest temperature on record . \n"}

Thad Allen , who was brought in by the government to oversee the spill response amid poorly received efforts by the British petroleum giant , began looking ahead to a day when he could hang up his hat . \nHe told The Associated Press in an interview Friday that although he 's still signed up `` for the foreseeable future , '' he 's had preliminary discussions with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about what 's next for him . \n`` I 'll be the national incident commander until they do n't have one anymore , '' he said , reflecting on the frenetic pace he 's kept in the past few weeks not only by monitoring containment and cleanup progress , but keeping the media and the public updated . \n`` You have to pace yourself , '' he said . \n`` You have to know when you can rest , take a nap . \nI try to achieve an economy of effort . \nIt 's obviously a fast pace and there are some long hours . '' \nThere was heartening news from other quarters , too , as scientists released a report saying that only about one-quarter of the nearly 207 million gallons of oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico is still oozing around the sea . \nEven the amount left , though , would still rank among the nation 's worst spills . \nBP left open the possibility that it could someday drill a new path into the same undersea reservoir of oil , still believed to hold nearly $ 4 billion worth of crude . \nChief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said that BP had n't considered the option yet but that `` we 're going to have to think about what to do with that at some point .

{"id": "1903", "time": "2010-10-05", "text": "ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- BP 's $ 20 billion fund to compensate victims of the Gulf oil spill has been inundated with inflated or unsupported claims and in some cases , outright fraud -- all slowing down the process of getting money to people who need and deserve it , the administrator of the program says . \nKenneth Feinberg said more than a third of the roughly 104,000 applicants need to do more to back up their claims , and thousands of claims have no documentation at all . \nHe added that the amount sought in some cases bears no resemblance to actual losses , such as a fisherman 's claim for $ 10 million `` on what was obviously a legitimate claim of a few thousand dollars . '' \n`` People can put down on a claims form all sorts of numbers , '' he said . \nAt the same time , hundreds of claims that were initially denied have been accepted as Feinberg adjusts rules for compensation , such as whether people need to be physically close to the spill to get paid . \n`` At the beginning , it 's always rough , '' said Feinberg , an attorney who previously oversaw claims for 9\\/11 victims . \n`` Hopefully , by the end of this program , people will feel that the fund treated them fairly . '' \nMany claimants are still waiting for checks from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which is doling out BP 's money to oil spill victims . \nThe Associated Press interviewed dozens who say they have received small fractions of the compensation they requested . \nClaims have been bogged down by the sheer volume of requests for money as livelihoods have crumbled since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil over about three months . \n`` We do n't have any business left , '' said Sheryl Lindsay , a beach wedding planner who filed a claim for about $ 240,000 for lost revenue from July through December because of cancellations . \nThe check she received from the BP claims center was for just $ 7,700 . \nLindsay said she recently learned that her claim will be reviewed for possible additional payments , but she needs money now . \nShe closed her coastal Alabama office and said she will soon file for bankruptcy . \nSuch complaints have `` not fallen on deaf ears , '' Feinberg said . \nIn an interview last week , he promised that kinks would be worked out and more generous payments would come , but that it is taking time to sort the legitimate claims from the overstated and the fraudulent . \n`` We have scores of applications for financial aid that appear to be fraudulent , '' and are being reviewed for possible forwarding to the Justice Department for criminal investigation , Feinberg said . \nSome of the suspect claims have obvious discrepancies , while others appear to be multiple filings for the same loss , he said . \n`` Our resources are diverted , and we become skeptical and concerned , '' he added . \n`` Fraud always slows the process down . '' \nTo date , the fund has paid out nearly $ 1 billion to about 50,000 claimants . \nClaims officials would not provide AP with the total amount actually requested by those claimants . \nA Feinberg spokeswoman said the number is `` irrelevant , '' given the volume of claims filed with problems . \nIn the past week , the number of denied claims actually fell , from 528 to 118 , as checks were cut and mailed to businesses that were initially told they would get no help . \nSales manager Jeff Silvers had been shocked to learn that his building supplies shop just a half mile from the Alabama coast was not considered to be affected by the oil that sullied beaches and marshes , sent tourists packing and kept fishing boats idle at harbors . \nSwift Supply , he said , lost a huge chunk of revenue because customers canceled plans to build docks , do home improvements and complete construction on new houses with the uncertainty that followed the explosion and oil gusher . \nBut after he applied for compensation , he initially was told `` we were n't in the geographic area of the spill . '' \nJust last week , however , Silvers got a check for everything he asked for . \nHe would not say how much he received . \nFeinberg has decided that proximity to affected areas will no longer play a role in compensation approval . \n`` I 'm very happy , '' Silvers said , `` but there 's still a lot of businesses that have n't been paid . '' \nEven the Justice Department has raised concern about the slow pace of payments . \n`` The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill has disrupted the lives of thousands upon thousands of individuals , often cutting off the income on which they depend , '' the department said in a Sept. 17 letter to Feinberg . \n`` Many of these individuals and businesses simply do not have the resources to get by while they await processing . '' \nFeinberg , however , said many of the claims are simply too flawed to pay out . \n`` We have thousands of claims where there is no documentation , none , '' he said . \nOf the more than 104,000 claims filed as of Monday , more than 39,000 require additional documentation and remain on hold . \nThousands of others remain under review . \nPresident Barack Obama tapped Feinberg to oversee the BP claims fund , which the oil giant created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill . \nFeinberg declined to say how much he is being paid by BP , only that it is a flat fee `` totally unrelated '' to the size of the fund and amounts paid . \nA final settlement will be offered in the coming months , but to accept the money , applicants will have to give up the right to sue BP . \nThe money being doled out now is considered only emergency help , but will be factored into the final payment offer . \nFishing guide Mike Garey , who got just $ 21,000 in response to his request for $ 70,000 in losses , is n't sure what he 'll do . \n`` The phones are n't ringing . \nThe e-mails are n't coming in , '' he said . \n`` Where will we be in a year from now ? \nNobody knows the answer to that so how can we accept a final payment ?

{"id": "1694", "time": "2010-08-09", "text": "July 15 : Freshly sorted blue crabs sit in a box in Hopedale , La. . \nResearchers wondering how badly the Gulf of Mexico will suffer from the oil spill are paying close attention to the blue crab . \n-LRB- AP -RRB- BARATARIA , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- To assess how heavy a blow the BP oil spill has dealt the Gulf of Mexico , researchers are closely watching a staple of the seafood industry and primary indicator of the ecosystem 's health : the blue crab . \nWeeks ago , before engineers pumped in mud and cement to plug the gusher , scientists began finding specks of oil in crab larvae plucked from waters across the Gulf coast . \nThe government said last week that three-quarters of the spilled oil has been removed or naturally dissipated from the water . \nBut the crab larvae discovery was an ominous sign that crude had already infiltrated the Gulf 's vast food web -- and could affect it for years to come . \n`` It would suggest the oil has reached a position where it can start moving up the food chain instead of just hanging in the water , '' said Bob Thomas , a biologist at Loyola University in New Orleans . \n`` Something likely will eat those oiled larvae ... and then that animal will be eaten by something bigger and so on . '' \nTiny creatures might take in such low amounts of oil that they could survive , Thomas said . \nBut those at the top of the chain , such as dolphins and tuna , could get fatal `` megadoses . '' \nMarine biologists routinely gather shellfish for study . \nSince the spill began , many of the crab larvae collected have had the distinctive orange oil droplets , said Harriet Perry , a biologist with the University of Southern Mississippi 's Gulf Coast Research Laboratory . \n`` In my 42 years of studying crabs I 've never seen this , '' Perry said . \nShe would n't estimate how much of the crab larvae are contaminated overall , but said about 40 percent of the area they are known to inhabit has been affected by oil from the spill . \nTulane University researchers are investigating whether the splotches also contain toxic chemical dispersants that were spread to break up the oil but have reached no conclusions , biologist Caz Taylor said . \nIf large numbers of blue crab larvae are tainted , their population is virtually certain to take a hit over the next year and perhaps longer , scientists say . \nHow large the die-off would be is unclear , Perry said . \nAn estimated 207 million gallons of oil have spewed into the Gulf since an April 20 drilling rig explosion triggered the spill , and thousands of gallons of dispersant chemicals have been dumped . \nScientists will be focusing on crabs because they 're a `` keystone species '' that play a crucial role in the food web as both predator and prey , Perry said . \nRichard Condrey , a Louisiana State University oceanographer , said the crabs are `` a living repository of information on the health of the environment . '' \nNamed for the light-blue tint of their claws , the crabs have thick shells and 10 legs , allowing them to swim and scuttle across bottomlands . \nAs adults , they live in the Gulf 's bays and estuaries amid marshes that offer protection and abundant food , including snails , tiny shellfish , plants and even smaller crabs . \nIn turn , they provide sustenance for a variety of wildlife , from redfish to raccoons and whooping cranes . \nAdults could be harmed by direct contact with oil and from eating polluted food . \nBut scientists are particularly worried about the vulnerable larvae . \nThat 's because females do n't lay their eggs in sheltered places , but in areas where estuaries meet the open sea . \nCondrey discovered several years ago that some even deposit offspring on shoals miles offshore in the Gulf . \nThe larvae grow as they drift with the currents back toward the estuaries for a month or longer . \nMany are eaten by predators , and only a handful of the 3 million or so eggs from a single female live to adulthood . \nBut their survival could drop even lower if the larvae run into oil and dispersants . \n`` Crabs are very abundant . \nI do n't think we 're looking at extinction or anything close to it , '' said Taylor , one of the researchers who discovered the orange spots . \nStill , crabs and other estuary-dependent species such as shrimp and red snapper could feel the effects of remnants of the spill for years , Perry said . \n`` There could be some mortality , but how much is impossible to say at this point , '' said Vince Guillory , biologist manager with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . \nPerry , Taylor and Condrey will be among scientists monitoring crabs for negative effects such as population drop-offs and damage to reproductive capabilities and growth rates . \nCrabs are big business in the region . \nIn Louisiana alone , some 33 million pounds are harvested annually , generating nearly $ 300 million in economic activity , Guillory said . \nBut fishermen who can make a six-figure income off crabs in a good year now are now idled -- and worried about the future . \n`` If they 'd let us go out and fish today , we 'd probably catch crabs , '' said Glen Despaux , 37 , who sets his traps in Louisiana 's Barataria Bay . \n`` But what 's going to happen next year , if this water is polluted and it 's killing the eggs and the larvae ? \nI think it 's going to be a long-term problem .

'' \nExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson told the committee that the Gulf spill would not have occurred if BP had properly designed its deep-water well . \n`` We do not proceed with operations if we can not do so safely , '' said Tillerson . \nShell president Marvin Odum insisted , `` Safety and environmental protection shall and will be Shell 's top priorities . '' \nOn Monday , Waxman 's committee released documents that showed BP made a series of money-saving shortcuts and blunders that dramatically increased the danger of a destructive spill from a well that an engineer ominously described as a `` nightmare '' just six days before the April blowout . \nInvestigators found that BP was badly behind schedule on the project and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars with each passing day , and responded by cutting corners in the well design , cementing and drilling efforts and the installation of key safety devices . \n`` Time after time , it appears that BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense . \nIf this is what happened , BP 's carelessness and complacency have inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants , and the workers on the rig , '' Waxman and Rep. Bart Stupak , a Democrat and chairman of the committee 's investigations panel , wrote in a letter . \nOne lawmaker after another expressed frustration at BP 's inability to stop oil gushing from its stricken well as the chief executives representing ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell -- as well as BPAmerica -- sat shoulder to shoulder at the witness table . \nBP said Tuesday it was speeding up payments for large commercial claims . \nThe company said in a statement that it has approved initial payments toward 90 percent of large commercial claims filed as a result of financial losses in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill . \nBP said it approved 337 payments totaling $ 16 million to businesses that have filed claims larger than $ 5,000 apiece . \nInitial payments began over the weekend and will be completed this week , the company said . \nThe Obama administration has pressured BP to speed up payments of claims in the wake of the Gulf oil spill . \nMeanwhile , Republicans used the hearing to accuse the White House of `` exploiting '' the Gulf oil spill crisis in order to pass a Democratic-backed energy and climate bill that 's stalled in the Senate . \n`` The president is trying to exploit this disaster to pass his national energy tax , '' Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La . \n, told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , as well as the nation 's top oil executives , who gathered Tuesday on Capitol Hill . \n`` Stop exploiting this disaster to pass this cap and trade tax , '' Scalise said . \n`` Cap and trade '' is a phrase used mostly by Republicans to refer to a climate measure the House approved last year . \nThe legislation would `` cap '' the amount of pollutants firms could emit . \nBut firms could pollute more by trading for `` credits '' with other polluters , and many Republicans have decried the policy as a `` national energy tax . '' \nPresident Obama is expected to ask Congress to approve climate legislation when he speaks to the nation in his first Oval Office address Tuesday night following a two-day trip to the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` To exploit this crisis to resurrect his climate change legislation is just wrong , '' added House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence , R-Ind . \n`` People expect the administration not to use this incident to advance their liberal agenda . '' \nA few Republicans joined Democrats to pass the climate bill in the House a year ago . \nBut the legislation is stymied in the Senate . \nMany moderate Democrats fear the bill could hurt jobs in the energy sector and along in the Gulf Coast . \nThe House hearing marked the first time that the chief executives of the major oil companies -- all leaders in deep-water drilling in the Gulf -- were called before Congress since the April 20 BP explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . \nThe accident killed 11 workers and unleashed the nation 's worst oil spill . \nThe government has estimated that as much as 2 million gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil a day may be flowing into the Gulf . \nWaxman 's committee is expected to question BPAmerica chairman Lamar McKay on internal company e-mails and documents that the lawmaker said showed that BP made repeated decisions in the days and hours before the explosion that increased the risk of a major well blowout . \nFox News ' Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}

Steve Scalise , R-La . \nThe congressman was referring to the `` cap-and-trade '' legislation that Democrats have been trying to push through Congress since last year . \nAfter the House approved a version of the bill last June , the Senate has been sitting on the proposal while other issues like health care and financial regulation moved to the front of the legislative line . \nNow that the BP oil spill has focused national attention on the potential negative effects of offshore drilling , Republicans say Obama will use it to his political advantage . \n`` Never has a mission statement fit an administration as perfectly as Rahm Emanuel 's ` never allow a crisis to go to waste . ' \nClimate change policy is important , but first things first , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , describing the energy bill as a tax on everyone that would `` do nothing '' to stop the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` Somehow he thinks he can use the tragedy in the Gulf as a reason to pass cap-and-trade , '' said Sen. James Inhofe , R-Okla . \n`` There is no relationship between the oil spill and cap-and-trade . '' \nThe climate bill most likely to pass the Senate is one sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , I-Conn . \n, and John Kerry , D-Mass . \nThey said on Tuesday that their bill will save energy and create jobs . \n`` It will create 440,000 additional jobs annually through 2020 and 540,000 additional jobs through 2030 , '' Kerry said . \nLieberman said one analysis shows the plan would save 2 million barrels of oil a day by 2030 -- in part by getting heavy trucks to run on natural gas . \nHe said that inaction at this point would lead to sustained dependence on oil and `` risk repetition of what 's happening in the Gulf today . '' \nBut critics are extremely skeptical about both claims . \nPrevious assessments of cap-and-trade bills warned of job losses , and analysts say savings in oil are hard to come by : `` In automobiles , at least in the short run , next 10 years or so , it 's very difficult to switch from one energy source to another , '' said David Kreutzer , research fellow for energy economics and climate change with the Heritage Foundation . \nHe said the climate legislation and its mandate to cut emissions would end up hurting the country 's coal industry `` dramatically .

{"id": "1556", "time": "2010-06-15", "text": "June 15 , 2010 : President Obama speaks from the Oval Office on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nPresident Obama , in the first televised Oval Office message of his presidency , sought to quell rising anger over his response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by saying he will demand that BP 's chairman set aside whatever money is needed to compensate those who have been harmed by the company 's `` recklessness . '' \n`` We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused , '' Obama said in an 18-minute speech . \n`` And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . '' \nObama announced that he had asked former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan -- to be funded by BP -- in concert with local states , communities , fishermen , conservationists and residents `` as soon as possible . '' \nObama did not detail what this plan should include . \n`` Sadly , no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done , '' Obama said . \n`` That 's why the second thing we 're focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . '' \nObama said the millions of gallons of crude oil that have gushed into Gulf waters from a broken well `` are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . '' \nThe speech comes on the eve of Obama 's meeting with top BP executives at the White House on Wednesday . \n`` We share the president 's goal of shutting off the well as quickly as possible , cleaning up the oil and mitigating the impact on the people and environment of the Gulf Coast , '' a BP spokesperson said . \n`` We look forward to meeting with President Obama tomorrow for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals . '' \nBut House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , said Obama should n't `` exploit this crisis to impose a job-killing national energy tax on struggling families and small businesses . '' \nHe also said any escrow fund established should be used to help Gulf Coast victims , `` not as a slush fund for trial lawyers or administration officials seeking to paper over their own misguided decisions . '' \n`` I sincerely hope that the Obama administration will not try to use a crisis made worse by its own failings to score political points on the backs of Americans living and working on the Gulf Coast , '' Boehner said in a written statement . \n`` This moment demands a call to action based on our shared interest in stopping this leak , cleaning up this mess , and finding out what went wrong . '' \nMuch of Obama 's speech was devoted to a recitation of steps his administration has taken to clean the oil , help the distraught people of the Gulf and prevent another environmental crisis . \n`` We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes , '' Obama said . \nObama used the speech not only to lay out his administration 's plan to contain the oil spill but also to try and reverse the political toll it 's taken on his presidency . \nThe president has taken a hit in the polls as oil continues to wash onto beaches and into critical wildlife habitat . \nAnd the crisis has taken up much of his time , forcing him to cancel a trip to Asia and Australia while threatening to stall his legislative agenda on such issues as financial overhaul , climate change and immigration reform . \nThe speech set the stage for his showdown meeting Wednesday at the White House with top executives at British-based , BP , the company that leased the rig that exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and causing the catastrophic spill . \nIt 's part of an effort by Obama , who 's been seen by some as detached as the oil spill disaster initially unfolded , to convince a frightened Gulf Coast and a skeptical nation that he is in command . \nDemocrats who were given an advance briefing by the White House on Obama 's speech praised the president 's remarks . \n`` It 's time to take this tragedy and turn it into an opportunity , '' Sen. Bill Neslon , D-Fla . \n, said in a written statement . \n`` I congratulate the president on saying we are now going to declare that this nation is getting on the road rapidly to breaking our dependence on oil . \nWe are at a point now , through research and development , that we are going to wean ourselves from petroleum addiction .

{"id": "55", "time": "2010-06-12", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- Oil from the worst spill in U.S. history could soon end up at gas stations , construction sites and even grocery stores once BP sells the crude taken from a ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico to raise money for wildlife protection . \nEnergy giant BP PLC announced this week it will donate its share of the proceeds generated by selling the oil captured from the well to fund efforts to protect and restore wildlife habitat along the Gulf Coast . \nThe company has not released specifics on how the fund will work and said it does n't know how much money might be raised . \nBut once the oil is brought to shore , it will creep into the world 's economic supply chain unnoticed by consumers . \n`` Oil is oil , '' said Julius Langlinais , professor emeritus of petroleum engineering at Louisiana State University . \n`` There 's no stamp or anything on it . \nIt 's all the same molecules . '' \nScientists have estimated that anywhere between about 40 million gallons -LRB- 151 million liters -RRB- to 109 million gallons -LRB- 413 million liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since a drilling rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man for the oil spill , said that since the leak began , 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of crude have been siphoned off the leaking well using tubes and caps . \nAn additional 18 million gallons -LRB- 68 million liters -RRB- have been skimmed from the ocean surface , he said . \nThe skimmed liquid is generally only 10 to 15 percent oil . \nNegotiations were still ongoing Friday to find a buyer for all that captured oil , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said . \n`` There 's nothing special about it , other than everyone 's looking at it , '' he said . \nIt 's possible the oil wo n't even be sold to a refinery directly by BP or processed in the Gulf . \nBig oil companies have trading departments that commonly swap barrels of crude with other firms or sell them to traders who could route the oil across the globe , Langlinais said . \nOnce that crude hits a refinery , the oil could end up in a wide array of fuels and products including gasoline , diesel , heating oil , asphalt and plastic -- including the bags used at grocery stores , the cases for cell phones and microwaves . \nIt also can be used as raw feed for chemical companies . \n`` I think it 's an eye-opening experience for people who do n't give it much thought when they finally realize how much their lives depend on oil , '' Langlinais said . \nBP has said it plans to boost its ability to directly capture oil gushing from the well by early next week . \nA semi-submersible drilling rig would capture and burn up to 420,000 gallons -LRB- 1.59 million liters -RRB- of oil daily . \nOnce on board , the oil and gas collected from the well will be sent down a boom and burned at sea . \nA drill ship already at the scene can process a maximum of 756,000 gallons -LRB- 2.86 million liters -RRB- of oil daily that 's sucked up through a containment cap sitting on the well head . \nFederal officials are still reviewing BP 's plan to build a new containment system designed to capture more oil and be more durable during hurricane season . \nAllen said the plan could be revised based on calculations of how much oil is spilling from the well . \nIt 's unclear how much the captured oil will be worth once it 's sold . \nOil was trading around $ 74 a barrel Friday , but BP officials said they expect to get a lower price than normal because the oil captured from the leak is laced with methanol . \nBP is injecting methanol as an antifreeze into the inside of the containment cap sitting over the gushing well to prevent the buildup of an ice-like slush that can clog the pipes . \nUnder its operating agreement , BP gets 65 percent of the net revenue made by selling oil from the leak site . \nAfter deducting for royalty payments owed to the government , it will donate its share of the proceeds to the wildlife fund . \nAnadarko Petroleum Corp. , which is entitled to 25 percent of the oil revenue , is still discussing what to do with its share of the money when the oil is sold , Anadarko spokesman Matt Carmichael said . \n`` We 're committed to doing the right thing , '' he said . \nA subsidiary of Mitsui & Co. . \nLtd. , which has a 10 percent stake , declined to comment . \nMeanwhile , the oil seemed to keep coming ashore unabated Saturday morning . \nGlobs of tar lined the white sands of Orange Beach , Alabama -- some the size of small pancakes . \nTony Tingle of Trussville , Alabama , said it was even worse the evening before . \n`` It was actually crude oil , not tar balls . \nAll the cleaning crews flooded in . \nThe skimming boats came in pretty quickly , helicopters were circling , and a bunch of boats came in . \nIt smelled like a machine shop , '' Tingle said . \nDuring a flight over the Gulf of Mexico , aerial spotter Sean Brumley said he saw an oily sheen and brown patches of oil floating for miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- off the coast . \n`` The Gulf looks like it has chicken pox , '' Brumley said . \n"}

'' \nShe 's been clobbering President Obama for his handling of the oil spill , especially for not meeting with BP 's CEO , Tony Hayward . \nWell , the big meeting between President Obama and Hayward is happening next week . \nMaybe President Obama reads Governor Palin 's Facebook page ? \nGovernor Palin joins us . \nGood evening , Governor . \nNice to see you . \nSARAH PALIN , FORMER GOVERNOR\\/FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : Hey , thanks so much , Greta . \nThanks for having me . \nVAN SUSTEREN : All right , Governor , you have said about the spill , this 53-day-old spill in Gulf of Mexico , that the president should call you . \nWere you being flip and coy and having some fun with him , or do you have some ideas that you could give him to help him handle this spill ? \nPALIN : No , I have some ideas , and I think a lot of other Americans have some ideas , especially those who have some experience working with these oil companies and knowing that there is such a need to verify the information that oil execs would be giving a public official because the oil executive 's perception of reality , really , is different than a public official 's would be . \nIn the case of this spill , to see now that we 're on day 54 and the Obama administration is just now deciding that they will meet with BP is a pretty atrocious thing to have to realize because , Greta , what this has resulted in is an industry player like BP has been put in the position , this player with astronomical liability exposure , gets to define the facts of the spill , instead of from day one , working together , CEO to CEO level , the president and Hayward and board members of BP working together to define what the facts are in this situation . \nVAN SUSTEREN : OK , walk me through this . \nSuppose that you were in the position as President Obama is , and you 've invited the CEO and other executives of BP . \nThey walk into the room . \nDo you ask the questions ? \nDo you issue the orders ? \nDo they ask the questions ? \nWhat are you going to do ? \nPALIN : Well , you know , even before walking in the room with BP , some orders need to be issued . \nFor one , there needs to be a waving of the Jones Act so that we could have had many , many days ago , weeks ago , some help with skimmers from elsewhere , besides just U.S. flagships , come over and help in this tragedy . \nAnd that order needs to be given to Admiral Allen right now . \nIt 's amazing to me and to so many others that though President Bush had been able to waive Jones Act provisions for Katrina , President Obama has n't thought to do that yet ? \nAnd yet surely , that has been suggested by those experts around him . \nBut to know , too , that it took nine days before anybody in the administration -- finally , it was Napolitano who decided that this was going to be of national significance and a disaster would need to be declared . \nIt took nine days , instead of just from day one or day two realizing that this was going to be a disaster for gulf residents and for the livelihoods affecting so many people -- nine days , and that was a setback for DOD assistance that could have been provided . \nVAN SUSTEREN : All right , as governor of the state that 's so known for on-shore drilling , tell me , educate me . \nI know what happens when you have huge leaks under water at these enormous depths . \nWhat 's the worst-case scenario for a leak or spill on shore ? \nBecause I 'm trying to decide , you know -- you know , which is -- which is worse , not that you want to pick between the , you know , hanging or the electric chair , but which -- can you contain a leak on shore ? \nPALIN : Absolutely , you can . \nAnd that 's why it 's frustrating to know that the extreme environmentalists have won out , if you will , on disallowing so much of the safe on-shore drilling that is time-tested , the technology that would allow safer drilling there . \nThey 've kind of shooed away the opportunity into deep , deep water out in the ocean , where it 's been unprecedented , the technology that 's been needed in order to remedy a tragedy , a spill like we 're seeing today . \nAlaska has spill contingency plans that make a lot of sense . \nAnd we found out now in this case of the gulf spill that the contingency plan that BP had been able to get approved by MMS and by the feds was boilerplate language taken out of the Alaska contingency plan , and that 's baffling to most of us who realize how different the gulf deep water conditions are from the on-shore and shallow water drilling up there in Alaska . \nAnd this is evidenced by , Greta , when you read that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- contingency plan that was approved that , obviously , nobody really had read . \nThey 're talking about marine mammals that are not indigenous to the gulf , but walruses and sea otters , other things that -- again , it 's evidence that language was taken from an Alaskan plan and applied to something that , at the end of the day , we realize is really irrelevant to the gulf conditions , the deep water conditions in the gulf . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Governor , I 'm one of those animal extremists , as you saw . \nI mean , it 's , like , you know , that 's the first thing I think of . \nAnd of course , now we see what 's happened to the bird life and other marine life in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBut tell me , what has been the animal response to the pipeline there ? \nBecause you know , that 's where -- that 's always going to be a hard sell with me unless you convince me that the animals are fine . \nI know we need energy , but I 'm a bleeding heart for the animals . \nPALIN : Yes , and that 's why when you travel up to Prudhoe Bay , you 're going to see a thriving caribou herd and other wildlife that has a thriving population because , for instance , the pipeline -- the trans-Alaska oil pipeline that has been built safely and above ground , so that there are walkways for the animals to crawl under . \nYou 're going to see no adverse impact on wildlife population . \nIn fact , a lot of the caribou herd has been able to increase dramatically since these 30 years have gone by with pipeline construction . \nAlaska is very , very cognizant of the fact that the wildlife needs to be protected . \nSo all that we do with on-shore drilling is to make sure that wildlife and the safety of our workers is so incorporated into the plan for development . \nThis is a tragedy , again , as we 're seeing in the gulf , where they did not have the plans to deal with a blow-out under water in such deep depths that now one of the ramifications so negative is the wildlife that will be killed . \nVAN SUSTEREN : All right , switch topics to South Carolina . \nYou endorsed Nikki Haley for governor . \nShe almost squeaked by . \nShe 's got a runoff on June 22nd . \nShould her opponent withdraw now so there wo n't be the runoff , or not ? \nI know you endorse her , but what do you think ? \nShould he have his fair shot at this runoff ? \nPALIN : Well , he should have a fair shot . \nYou know , I 'm such a proponent of competition , even into a runoff after a primary where Nikki did win handily , and she 's going to win again . \nAnd a lot of people are going to look at this as wasting public resources paying for a runoff vote when Nikki 's going to thump him again . \nSo kind of a waste of resources , but I 'm not going to be one to discourage that continued competition , giving him a fair shot . \nFine with me if he decides to stay in it , even though , you know , it 's probably going to be a futile effort . \nVAN SUSTEREN : How about Mr. Greene , the opponent of Senator Jim DeMint ? \nWhat do you think about him ? \nHe 's got some problems , apparently . \nHe 's got some problems ! \nHe 's got some answers to give , does n't he . \nBut that 's the Democrat ticket 's problem . \nAnd you know , I think it 's kind of a shame , though , that the Democrats , so heavy-handed wanting to shoo somebody off their ticket when the guy won . \nHe won fair and square , and he 's the name on the ticket and they 're going to have to live with it . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Carly Fiorina , state of California , another one of your picks . \nAnd I should add that you did n't have 100 percent . \nNot all your picks necessarily won . \nBut certainly , Carly Fiorina 's numbers seemed to jump date coincident with your endorsement . \nYou took heat for that endorsement . \nAnd is there anything you do n't agree with Carly Fiorina on ? \nPALIN : I do n't have regrets at all about endorsing Carly , and I sure do n't and do n't think anybody should give me credit for shifting momentum her way . \nShe was on a roll anyway , and my name added to her ticket really is just a two-edged sword that she has to live with because she gets -- anybody is going to get attacked a little bit more , I believe , if my name is attached to their candidacy . \nSo bless her heart , she 's got that challenge that she has to overcome because I endorsed her . \nBut no , she 's great and she is what California needs . \nShe is what this nation needs , somebody who understands how to live within their means , somebody who 's run a business and understands what it means to make payroll and live within a budget and have to produce in order to be rewarded monetarily . \nThat 's something that 's so lacking in so many of our government officials ! \nWe need Carly in there . \nVAN SUSTEREN : You know , as we look forward to 2012 -- I know people always say , Are you going to run or you 're not going to run ? \nLet me ask you , before I move on to the possibilities , have you made a decision not to run ? \nPALIN : I have not made that decision , no. . \nVAN SUSTEREN : OK . \nNow , Governor Pawlenty -- he has not said he 's made a decision to run or not , but when do you think that we should start hearing from the people at least on the Republican side ? \nWe know who the nominee , at least I expect the nominee 's going to be President Obama . \nBut when should we expect to hear from Republicans , you know , either in or out in the race ? \nPALIN : You know , ideally , Greta , I think it should n't be for about another year because there is so much to take care of in terms of in our own communities , in our own states , in helping the individual parties to elect people to make the right decisions to get our country back on the right track that for individuals to start pimping their own campaign so early , I think it 's futile . \nI think it wastes a lot of time . \nSo much can happen in a day , a week , a month of politics in the American system that I think it 's kind of ridiculous to start talking about it this early . \nVAN SUSTEREN : And of course , we do the unthinkable in the media . \nWe keep trying to ask everybody , so I think we 're sort of partially responsible for doing that to the candidates . \nGovernor , stand by because we have more with you . \nPALIN : Well , yes . \nAnd you keep getting the same answers , too , from all of us , do n't you ! \nVAN SUSTEREN : I know . \nAll right , Governor . \nWho could forget that infamous Newsweek cover of Governor Palin in running shorts ? \nWell , Newsweek is at it again . \nWe 're going to show you the new cover of Newsweek , and Governor Palin will tell you what she thinks . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Well , who could forget that infamous Newsweek cover ? \nIt shows Governor Sarah Palin in short shorts , running shorts . \nWell , check out Newsweek 's latest Palin cover . \nThings are a little different this time . \nIt shows Governor Palin with a halo over her head . \nThe headline , `` Saint Sarah . '' \nNow , the article 's about Governor Palin 's appeal to conservative Christian women . \nGovernor Palin is back with us . \nGovernor , what do you make of the new cover ? \nNow it 's Saint Sarah ? \nPALIN : Have n't seen it , but if the title and what I hear about the content is any indication of where Newsweek is going , it 's no wonder that Newsweek is doing so poorly . \nPeople are not reading that stuff . \nIt 's not relevant . \nIt 's not interesting stuff that they 're making up and writing . \nAnd that 's why they 're going down . \nVAN SUSTEREN : You know , it 's sort of interesting , Governor . \nI 'll take a bet with you . \nMaybe you wo n't take this bet with me . \nBut the last segment , we discussed policy . \nI asked about energy policy since energy is so important to your home state of Alaska . \nMy guess is this next question I 'm going to ask you , which is the buzz of the Internet , it 's in mainstream media -- I bet it gets more attention than our discussion about energy . \nSo here it is . \nDid you have them or not ? \nBecause that 's all over the Internet about you , and mainstream media . \nPALIN : Well , first , Greta , you know why we love you ? \nBecause you 're not afraid to ask the questions . \nAnd I got to respect you for asking that question because I know that `` boobgate '' is all over the Internet right now because there are a lot of , I guess , bored , idle bloggers and reporters with nothing else to talk about . \nAnd I think some of those folks , too , they need to grab a shovel , go down to the gulf , volunteer to help , clean up and save a whale or something instead of reporting on such stupid things like that . \nNo , I have not had implants . \nI ca n't believe , yes , that we 're even talking about this . \nI think a report like that is about as real and truthful as those reports that Todd and I are divorcing or that I bought a place in the Hamptons or that Trigg is not my own child . \nAnd we still put up with that kind of garbage , too , in even the mainstream media , Greta . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Well , the reason I -- I mean , I hope that puts an end to it and I hope we do n't , you know , be obsessed at it . \nBut it is extraordinary how -- you know , the fact -- the truth is , is that -- you know , is that you show up on -- on -- with the short shorts on the Newsweek cover . \nThat was not a picture you gave Newsweek . \nNewsweek actually went out and looked for that one . \nYou 've got situations where Secretary of State Clinton gets clobbered . \nAnd the thing that -- besides the fact of what happens to you and to Secretary of State Clinton and other women who are successful in politics is that -- where are the feminists who are so appalled at -- when things are supposedly -- have you -- have you heard from them ? \nPALIN : No , Greta . \nAnd that is what 's fascinating to me about all of this , too , about this -- this kind of platform that I 've been blessed to be able to stand on and get a message out there to other Americans , and so much of the ignoring of that message and focus on superficial , really ridiculous aspects of who I am or maybe other women are . \nFor other women who are in positions of some authority and some influence , for them to participate in what it is that , for instance , Newsweek does and some of these reporters talking about breast implants -- to see other women participate in this I think really certainly diminishes their cause for women 's rights and for equal treatment of women . \nIt baffles me that they would want to participate in this . \nVAN SUSTEREN : Well , it 's a bit disappointing , since the whole idea of the women 's movement on both sides of the aisle was to make sure women had a level playing field , that they had the same opportunity as men . \nAnd if the women are part of the gossip and are promoting it -- and the buzz on this last round with you is enormous . \nI mean , if you Google your name , I mean , there are -- there are , you know , lots of , lots of articles about this . \nI mean , it really is distressing that the women are n't stepping up and saying , Look , you know , I agree with Governor Palin or I do n't agree with Governor Palin , but this is n't right , you know , that we 're -- that we do this to her or to any other women , to -- I used Secretary of State Clinton as another example . \nPALIN : Yes , I think it 's pretty ridiculous . \nAnd what it does , it ends up ultimately wasting time and wasting people 's energies . \nHere 's an example of how it kind of wastes some time . \nTo be judged on or to be talked about on appearance , say chest size -- it makes me wear layers . \nIt makes me have to waste time figuring out , What am I going to wear so that nobody will look in a area that I do n't need them to look at ? \nI want them to hear what it is that I 'm saying . \nIt ends up wasting time and that 's just very , very unfortunate . \nVAN SUSTEREN : All right , let 's move on to Facebook . \nDid you know that president -- former President Bush is now on Facebook ? \nPALIN : I saw that and I heard that he did his inaugural address . \nVAN SUSTEREN : What -- I mean , it 's extraordinary when you think of where politics -- I mean , 10 years ago , even the concept of FaceBook -- I mean , it did n't even exist . \nI mean , it 's bizarre . \nNow -- now we -- now we , you know , have FaceBook from our politicians . \nPALIN : You know why it is ? \nWe have got to -- those of us who are just common sense conservative , we have got to have that ability to speak with the American voter , with the public , minus the filter of the `` lamestream media '' that does not like our message . \nAnd in the case where we are presently , they want to protect President Obama 's big government agenda . \nSo whatever it is that we say or do or want to translate via print or television , they filter it and they misconstrue things and they misreport . \nSo hey , we 're going right to the people via Twitter , via Facebook , whatever we can to get the truth out there to the American public about what 's going on in this country . \nVAN SUSTEREN : There goes employment in the news business ! \nWe 're going to lose our jobs if you guys keep doing that , going straight to the people . \nGovernor , thank you . \nPALIN : Thank you so much , Greta . \nContent and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. . \nAll materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , displayed , published or broadcast without the prior written permission of Roll Call . \nYou may not alter or remove any trademark , copyright or other notice from copies of the content . \n"}
{"id": "82", "time": "2010-06-12", "text": "President Obama makes a statement on his small business jobs initiatives , Friday , June 11 , 2010 , in the Rose Garden of the White House . \n-LRB- AP -RRB- President Obama on Saturday reassured Prime Minister David Cameron that his frustration over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is not an attack on Britain . \nBut a day earlier , Obama blasted U.S. lawmakers and Tea Party activists for criticizing his response to the nation 's worst environmental disaster , suggesting they are being hypocrites . \n`` I think it 's fair to say , if six months ago , before this spill had happened , I had gone up to Congress and I had said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and we need to spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill , there are folks up there , who will not be named , who would have said this is classic , big-government overregulation and wasteful spending , '' he told Politico in an interview . \nObama also suggested the criticism coming from anti-big government protesters , such as Tea Party activists , was hypocritical . \n`` Some of the same folks who have been hollering and saying ` do something ' are the same folks who , just two or three months ago , were suggesting that government needs to stop doing so much , '' Obama said . \n`` Some of the same people who are saying the president needs to show leadership and solve this problem are some of the same folks , who just a few months ago , were saying this guy is trying to engineer a takeover of our society through the federal government that is going to restrict our freedoms . '' \nBut Obama sang a much different tune to Cameron on Saturday when the two leaders held a `` warm and constructive '' telephone conversation for more than 30 minutes , Cameron 's Downing St. office said . \nCameron 's office said the prime minister `` expressed his sadness at the ongoing human and environmental catastrophe , '' but stressed BP 's economic important to Britain , the U.S. and other countries . \nThen Obama told the prime minister `` that his unequivocal view was that BP was a multinational global company and that frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity . \nThe prime minister stressed the economic importance of BP to the U.K. , U.S. and other countries . \nThe president made clear that he had no interest in undermining BP 's value . '' \nCameron is under pressure to get Obama to tone down the criticism fearing it will hurt the millions of British retirees that hold BP stock . \nThe company 's stock has lost 40 percent of its value since the April 20 oil rig fire . \nRep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . \n, fired back at Obama over his criticism of Congress , saying hypocrisy is no excuse for inaction `` in addressing the dysfunctional and corrupt nature of the Minerals and Management Service '' -- the agency that oversees offshore drilling . \n`` If President Obama had exercised some long overdue leadership and called on Congress to address the cozy relationship between MMS and the industry they regulate , I would have been the very first person to partner with him and give MMS the overhaul it desperately needs , '' Issa said in a written statement . \n`` After 10 inspector general reports , 10 GAO reports , a congressional investigation , the real question is , why did it take such a catastrophe for the president to call for action , '' he said . \nObama has sharpened his attacks on BP in recent days as the company struggles to stop oil gushing from its ruptured deepsea well . \nObama has said he would have fired BP 's top executive , if he were in charge , and has supported the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend . \nIn a sign the company feels the pressure , BP said Saturday that its board would meet Monday to discuss deferring its second-quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known . \nBP said no decision had yet been made . \nObama also has reproached BP for spending money on a public relations campaign and occasionally refers to `` British Petroleum , '' although the company years ago began using only its initials and is a far-reaching international corporation with extensive holdings in the United States , including a Texas refinery and a share of the Alaska oil pipeline . \nThis past week , the usually measured Obama said in a television interview , `` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar ; we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers -- so I know whose ass to kick .

'' \nThe document says `` BP will pay all necessary and appropriate clean-up cost '' as well as `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' claims for property damage , personal injury , and commercial losses . \nIt pledged that claims will be `` promptly investigated '' and that resolved claims would be paid promptly . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward also reiterated that promise in an interview Monday , telling NBC 's `` Today Show '' that the company was `` absolutely responsible '' for cleaning up the oil spill that resulted when a well exploded on April 20 . \nHayward also said BP is preparing for a `` worst case scenario '' that it would need to contain the spill for two to three months . \nThe White House has already stated that it is also looking for BP to compensate fisheries whose livelihood has been impacted by the spill of 5,000 barrels a day . \nBut the federal government will pick up the tab for other expenses , like the cost of deploying the National Guard . \nThe Pentagon said Monday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates has approved a request from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to have the federal government pay the cost of mobilizing the National Guard . \nAbout 6,000 Louisiana National Guard members have been authorized for use in the oil cleanup efforts , and so far 600 of those guardsmen have been formally requested by the on-scene coordinator , Rear Adm. Mary Landry . \nGates may be asked to authorize similar numbers of National Guard members in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama , department sources tell Fox News . \nObama on Sunday defended the administration 's response to the disaster and said he 's doing all he can to protect the fishing industry , which he called `` the heartbeat of the region 's economic life . '' \n`` We 're going to do everything in our power to protect our natural resources , compensate those who have been harmed , rebuild what has been damaged and help this region persevere like it has done so many times before , '' Obama said on his trip Sunday to Louisiana . \nA potential hazard beside the environment is a political one that depends on how the public judges the Obama administration 's response . \nIn 2005 , President George W. Bush stumbled in dealing with Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf and left the impression of a president distant from immense suffering . \nHis presidency never recovered . \nAdministration officials said they were on top of the accident from the first day though White House Press Secretary acknowledged Sunday that the first order of business after the explosion was search and rescue for 11 riggers now presumed dead . \nA declaration of national significance -- opening the way for greater government involvement -- came nine days later , when a new leak was discovered and it was determined that far more oil was leaking from the site than initially estimated . \n`` From day one , we have prepared and planned for the worst , '' Obama said . \n`` Your government will do whatever it takes , for as long as it takes , to stop this crisis . '' \nObama took a brief helicopter tour to view the kinds of marshlands and estuaries threatened by the spill . \nHigh winds prevented him from flying over the 30-mile spill . \nIt appeared little could be done in the short term to stem the oil flow , which was also drifting toward the beaches of neighboring Mississippi and farther east along the Florida Panhandle . \nObama said the slick was 9 miles off the southeastern Louisiana coast . \nBP Chairman Lamar McKay raised faint hope that the spill might be stopped more quickly by lowering a hastily manufactured dome to the ruptured wellhead a mile deep in the next six to eight days , containing the oil and pumping it to the surface . \nSuch a procedure has been used in some well blowouts but never at the mile-deep waters of this disaster . \nAn investigation is under way into the cause of the explosion and , depending on its outcome , questions may be raised about whether federal regulation of offshore rigs operating in extremely deep waters is sufficient and whether the government is requiring the best available technology to shut off such wells in event of a blowout . \nAdministration officials have been at pains to explain that Obama 's late March decision to expand offshore oil exploration could be altered as a result of the spill and that stricter safety rules would doubtless be written into leases . \nIn reality , oil companies and the government lack the technology to prevent the damage from a well gushing oil , killing wildlife and tainting a delicate ecosystem , though such instances are rare . \nThe Gulf of Mexico alone has had 30,000 wells drilled into it , and the gulf provides 30 percent of the U.S. supply of oil and natural gas . \nAdm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant , said the volume of spewing oil could climb to 100,000 barrels a day in the event of a total wellhead failure , a much greater breach than is believed to exist now . \nFox News ' Justin Fishel The Associated Press contributed to this report . \n"}

Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. , to New Orleans on May 2 . \n-LRB- AP Photo -RRB- President Obama warned Sunday that the vast oil spill nearing the Gulf coastline is a `` potentially unprecedented '' disaster , as he and other top administration officials defended the government 's response and pledged a `` relentless '' federal effort to clean up the slick . \nThe president visited Louisiana to survey the damage and hear from local officials , who told him the oil is about nine miles from the state 's coast . \nObama warned that the spill could `` seriously damage '' the local economy and environment . \n`` We 're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environment disaster , '' Obama said . \n`` It could extend for a long time . \nIt could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home .

'' \nThe federal response to the spill has fluctuated since the April 20 oil rig explosion that triggered the rupture . \nEarlier in the week , officials drastically increased their estimate of the size of the spill , from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day . \nThe Department of Homeland Security then declared the spill an incident of `` national significance '' on Thursday , freeing up resources to tackle the spreading problem . \nAnd after the White House initially insisted that Obama would not travel to the region , the president flew into New Orleans Sunday -- traveling in his motorcade to Venice , La. , two hours away , while meeting with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . \nThe White House also announced Sunday that it was canceling the president 's scheduled visit Wednesday to New Jersey to discuss the economy . \nWhite House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Obama `` just believed it was important to get down there as soon as he could and the quickest we could get down was today . '' \nSpeaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' top security and environmental officials said the federal government has been doing all it can to try to contain the mess . \n`` The administration responded all hands on deck from day one , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said , explaining that the response `` evolved '' from a search-and-rescue mission for 11 oil rig workers who are now presumed dead to the cleanup effort under way . \nShe said any comparison to the federal response to Hurricane Katrina , in which hundreds of people were killed and the government had advance warning , is `` a total mischaracterization . '' \nShe said BP is `` ultimately responsible '' for the disaster , an assessment echoed by Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard . \nAllen said the federal government should not completely take over the cleanup because , `` by statute and by law , BP is the responsible party . '' \nHe said the firm bears responsibility and costs in the aftermath of the spill . \nHe said , though , that the cleanup effort will continue to be a collaboration . \n`` It 's a combination of BP and the federal government , '' he said . \n`` We both have to execute our responsibilities .

{"id": "400", "time": "2010-06-24", "text": "Adm. Bob Papp listens during a briefing in New Orleans The government agency leading the effort to clean up the nation 's largest oil spill is preparing for two impending challenges to their mission along the Gulf Coast : hurricanes and budget cuts . \nOver two days , the newly-minted chief of the U.S. Coast Guard got an update on the efforts with a two-hour fly-over of the affected areas and a briefing at what some describe as the `` brain '' of the oil spill response . \n`` We 're making a dent in it , '' Adm. Bob Papp said on Wednesday as he and a Fox News crew flew in a helicopter over the BP oil rig that 's gushing up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` I see some improvement . \nThe surface definitely has improved , but we 're not out of the woods yet . '' \nThe day before , during his third trip to the region , Papp was briefed by representatives from BP , the military and other federal agencies about the coming hurricane season and plans to keep the clean-up effort intact even during strong storms . \n`` We 've got a lot of very expensive , valuable equipment out there taking care of this challenge , '' Papp said from inside the Unified Area Command center in New Orleans , La , where hundreds of what he called `` dedicated patriots '' from across the country process and analyze the information coming in from Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \n`` If we have a hurricane come through -- while we may have enough equipment out there right now to deal with what we 're facing -- what 's going to happen if some of that equipment is destroyed , damaged , or pushed off station ? '' \nEven though Papp only took the reins of the Coast Guard in late May , when Adm. Thad Allen retired as commandant but stayed on as `` Incident Commander , '' Papp said has had extensive experience with hurricanes from his time as Commander of the Coast Guard Atlantic Area , during which more than 30 named storms and hurricanes hit his region . \n`` So I know the devastation that -LRB- such storms -RRB- can bring on , '' he said . \n`` What we 've done now is we 've identified the additional resources we 're going to need in order to come in here in a worst case scenario , having a hurricane on top of this . \n... I 'm feeling very confident now that we 're going to be prepared to take on these extra challenges . '' \nIn particular , the Coast Guard has ordered about 20 more large , off-shore skimming boats , the types of vessels have been `` collecting the bulk of the oil out there , '' according to Papp . \nIn addition , the Coast Guard is putting pressure on boom manufacturers to `` get more boom down here '' for the hurricane season , Papp said . \n`` When a storm comes through , all that boom that 's out there could be in Arkansas by the time a hurricane -LRB- hits -RRB- , '' he said . \nMuch of the extra resources , including the off-shore skimming boats , are expected to arrive in the Gulf Coast within two weeks , according to Papp , who described his job as `` just commandant of the Coast Guard , '' providing `` resources into this operation to make sure that we 've got Coast Guard people , ships , aircraft and other resources down here to help Admiral Allen carry out -LRB- his -RRB- job '' as incident commander . \nAsked about suggestions that hurricanes could actually benefit the clean-up effort , Papp dismissed the notion . \n`` Nobody wins in an oil spill , nobody wins in a hurricane , '' he said . \n`` While -LRB- a hurricane -RRB- might disperse oil , I do n't think anybody wants a hurricane to hit this region if we do n't have to . \n... I 'd rather just be attacking oil and not have to worry about hurricanes . '' \nWhile the Coast Guard is struggling with oil , it 's also struggling to keep its other missions fulfilled . \n`` We do n't have a lot of bench strength , and all the resources that we 've brought down here are coming out of other coast guard missions , '' Papp said of his agency , which has only 42,000 uniformed personnel and 11 formal missions , including search-and-rescue operations and law enforcement . \n`` We have finite resources , so when I bring a couple dozen aircraft down here from other locations , a dozen or more ships from other locations , some of those other missions are going to get short-changed a little bit . '' \nComplicating things even further , the Coast Guard is facing a significant budget cut in the next year . \nThe Obama administration 's 2011 budget proposal for the Coast Guard is just over $ 10 billion , down more than $ 75 million from the year before , according to Coast Guard numbers . \nThe Coast Guard needed about a $ 100 million increase just to keep operations constant from the year before , and that estimate was reached before the oil spill ever happened , according to one source familiar with the Coast Guard budget . \nAsked whether the White House might propose more money for the Coast Guard after its efforts in the Gulf Coast , Papp said he could n't answer . \n`` I ca n't presume what the administration or the Congress might do , '' he said . \n`` All I know is : I know how much money I get , and we 'll put it to the best use for the taxpayer . \n... If we have something else come up , whether it is an East Coast hurricane , migrants coming to the country -LRB- illegally via sea -RRB- or a fishery situation in the gulf of Alaska , we 'll reassess and assign resources as we need to . '' \nFor now , Papp suggested , the trade-off is worthwhile , with skimming , burning and other efforts `` making a difference '' and creating `` smaller footprints '' of oil . \n`` This is very , very important to our country , '' he told the crew of a Coast Guard vessel in Pensacola , Fla , on Wednesday , just before they left to help clean-up oil . \n`` This is very , very important to the people of this region . '' \nBut , a day before , Papp told Fox News that clean-up efforts can only do so much . \n`` It 's a mistake to think that the oil is not going to reach the beaches , '' he said . \n`` We would not be truthful if we said we 're going to keep all the oil off the beaches . \nInevitably , there will be some oil on the beaches . \nSo what we have to do is collect as much of that oil out as far as we can .

{"id": "1570", "time": "2010-06-24", "text": "More than two months after the April 20 BP oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , experts are still trying to determine what the health effects will be on the workers who are struggling to clean up the biggest oil spill in American history . \nThere are concerns that some workers could suffer lung , kidney and liver damage from exposure to the volatile organic compounds found in the oil . \nAs of Wednesday , 407 oil exposure complaints had been reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers . \nIn Louisiana , more than 100 oil spill-related illnesses were reported , 74 of them from workers hired by BP . \n`` We 've seen a total of 11 patients that have come through our ER since May 26 , and most of them stayed for about two to three days , '' Taslin Alfonzo , spokeswoman for West Jefferson Medical Center in Marrero , La. , told FoxNews.com . \n`` They all complained of similar symptoms , which were nausea , dizziness , severe headaches , skin irritation and shortness of breath , which is an indication -- our doctors believe -- there was some kind of chemical exposure or chemical irritant that caused them to come in . '' \nBut exposure to toxic chemicals is n't the only thing causing workers to seek medical attention . \nWith the heat index in the Gulf hovering around 110 degrees during the steamy summer months , one of the main short-term health concerns is heat exhaustion . \n`` You really are talking about a triangle of heat , chemical exposure , and then the behavior changes that you see as a result , '' Linda McCauley , dean of Emory University 's School of Nursing in Atlanta , said at an Institute of Medicine hearing in New Orleans this week . \nBehavioral changes are just another layer of the health issues that could lie ahead for the workers cleaning up the Gulf . \nWith many fishermen out of work in an area still reeling from the lingering economic and emotional damage left by Hurricane Katrina five years ago , the mental health of both the workers and the residents affected by this environmental catastrophe could be fragile . \n`` Individuals who have been directly affected by it , their livelihoods , their very way of life from generations , being told to terminate it at this point in time , and not being able to determine which steps they need to take , '' Victor Sims , a clinical social worker and counselor at West Jefferson Behavior Medicine Center , told FoxNews.com . \nIt 's that type of situation that generates stress and anxiety , and then begins to exacerbate itself in changes in sleeping habits , changes in eating habits and other disorders based on their attempts to try and deal with this issue , he added . \nOn Wednesday , the United States Coast Guard reported the deaths of two oil spill workers in unrelated incidents . \nOne of the men , a 55-year-old boat captain , took his own life , the Gulf Shores Police Department said in a news release . \nWilliam Allen Kruse , of Foley , Ala. , was found above the wheelhouse of his boat at the Fort Morgan Marina in Gulf Shores , Ala. , with a single gunshot wound to the head that appeared to be self-inflicted . \nMedical screening for oil spill workers BP is taking precautions to ensure workers meet the physical health requirements to work under such extreme conditions . \nIn a partnership with West Jefferson Industrial Medicine , LLC , and West Jefferson Medical Center , the British oil giant has set up a medical screening clinic in Lafitte , La. , where potential workers are examined and trained before being hired to work on the cleanup . \n`` People are having physical exams , which includes an examination , screening for previous medical history for conditions like diabetes , cardiac disease , '' said Dr. Brian M. Bourgeois , owner of West Jefferson Industrial Medicine , LLC . \n`` They 're also being screened for problems that may make working in the heat and humidity for long hours difficult , like vision problems and physical ability to do manual labor-type work . '' \nAnother concern is the workers ' ability to work in an environment where they do n't necessarily have medical attention readily available , out in the open water , Bourgeois added . \nFor their part , community hospitals like West Jefferson have set up medical tents on the beaches of Grand Isle , La. , where workers , first responders and volunteers are often seen between shifts . \n`` Initially we wanted to set it up for the oil spill workers , but BP is handling that now , and so we 're mainly dealing with the first responders and anything that the community needs down there , '' Alfonzo said . \nWith $ 10 million set aside for tracking and surveillance of oil spill-related illnesses in states along the Gulf Coast , officials at the Department of Health and Human Services admit that little is known about the health impacts of oil spills on humans . \nIn the last 50 years , at least 400 spills have occurred around the world , yet only seven of them have been studied to date . \nPerhaps that 's why health officials on both the federal and local levels are now clamoring to implement health surveillance systems in Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- , the National Institutes of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- and the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- have been working with affected coastal communities to track cases of acute illnesses and trends in oil exposure-related hospital visits , medication sales and increases in certain diseases . \n`` What it 's going to do more likely than not , is maybe magnify preexisting conditions rather than being a causative agent for a new condition , '' Bourgeois said . \nIn an effort to closely monitor potentially serious long-term effects of those with the most exposure to the toxic chemicals -- the workers -- the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health -LRB- NIOSH -RRB- launched its own system . \nOf the nearly 35,000 BP oil spill response workers currently involved in the cleanup effort , 14,664 workers have volunteered to be part of the long-term tracking system . \nNicole Aber and Reuters contributed to this report . \n"}
{"id": "500", "time": "2010-06-23", "text": "Secretary of Energy Steven Chu -LRB- AP -RRB- . \nAs the Obama administration pursues a new moratorium on offshore drilling in reaction to the BP oil spill , a video circulating on YouTube shows it was n't too long ago that a future administration official looked to BP to `` save the world . '' \nEnergy Secretary Steven Chu , who was working at UC Berkeley at the time , says in the 2007 video , `` There 's been a lot of excitement that 's been growing over the last several years and now with partnering with BP we will have the resources to actually carry out some of the things we want to do in order to help save the world . '' \nSkip forward to June 2010 . \nFollowing the largest oil spill in U.S. history , President Obama implemented a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , claiming that a presidential commission needs time to study offshore safety operations after the April 22 explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe administration , however , hit a roadblock Tuesday when New Orleans federal judge Martin Feldman struck down the six-month ban on drilling , arguing that the rationale for the moratorium does n't factor in the safety records of other drilling locations in the Gulf . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday that the moratorium needs to stay in place until it 's known whether the deepwater drilling can be done safely . \nHe pledged to issue a new moratorium in the next few days that will eliminate any doubt that it 's needed and appropriate . \nThe Justice Department announced Wednesday evening that it will appeal the ruling , saying that a second deepwater blowout could overwhelm the efforts to respond to the BP disaster , which left 11 workers dead and unleashed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf . \nTwo disaster response workers were killed Wednesday during clean-up efforts . \nIn cementing its case for a moratorium , the White House has said BP and other oil companies can no longer be trusted in assuring the safety of offshore drilling . \nChu , a Nobel-prize winning physicist , worked as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley before being picked by Obama to serve as energy secretary . \nBP pledged a reported $ 500 million in February 2007 to help establish the Energy Biosciences Institute , an innovative biofuel program that Chu launched while working at UC Berkeley . \nTouted as the world 's largest public and private consortium that researches all aspects of bioenergy , the institute 's partners include BP , the University of California , Berkeley , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . \nThe institute focuses in particular on alternative transportation fuels . \nIn the 2007 video that re-emerged this week , is seen telling UC Berkeley chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau , `` We 're going to save the world in part by doing something about the energy problem . \nAnd this impacts national security , this impacts economic prosperity , and , and most important for me , this impacts stewardship of the environment . '' \nChu 's office told FoxNews.com Wednesday that the energy chief helped convince BP to fund the innovative biofuel program , aimed at developing technologies to produce fuel from biomass instead of oil . \n`` As anyone can tell from watching the video , Dr. Chu was talking in 2007 about the potential of the Energy Biosciences Institute to achieve breakthroughs that may play an important role in reducing our dependence on oil and in solving our global energy and climate challenges , '' Chu 's press secretary Stephanie Mueller said in an e-mail Wednesday . \n`` He has , of course , not been involved with that program since joining the -LRB- Interior -RRB- department , '' added Mueller . \nBP 's multimillion-dollar partnership with the institute shows the oil giant went to great lengths in its efforts to become `` greener , '' an irony in the oil disaster saga that is now reaching into its fourth month . \nThe institute to date has launched 68 programs in five research areas : feedstock development , biomass depolymerization , biofuels production , enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and the socio-economic impacts of cellulosic biofuels development . \nMore than 300 researchers are working to develop affordable and renewable sources of energy . \nAnd the program has produced a 320-acre energy farm that works as a `` living laboratory '' for developing promising biofuel feedstocks and studying greenhouse gas emissions . \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}

'' \nKessler 's crew took measurements of both surface and deep water within a 5-mile radius of BP 's broken wellhead . \n`` There is an incredible amount of methane in there , '' Kessler told reporters in a telephone briefing . \nIn some areas , the crew of 12 scientists found concentrations that were 100,000 times higher than normal . \n`` We saw them approach a million times above background concentrations '' in some areas , Kessler said . \nThe scientists were looking for signs that the methane gas had depleted levels of oxygen dissolved in the water needed to sustain marine life . \n`` At some locations , we saw depletions of up to 30 percent of oxygen based on its natural concentration in the waters . \nAt other places , we saw no depletion of oxygen in the waters . \nWe need to determine why that is , '' he told the briefing . \nMethane occurs naturally in sea water , but high concentrations can encourage the growth of microbes that gobble up oxygen needed by marine life . \nKessler said oxygen depletions have not reached a critical level yet , but the oil is still spilling into the Gulf , now at a rate of as much as 60,000 barrels a day , according to U.S. government estimates . \n`` What is it going to look like two months down the road , six months down the road , two years down the road ? '' \nMethane , a natural gas , dissolves in seawater and some scientists think measuring methane could give a more accurate picture of the extent of the oil spill . \nKessler said his team has taken those measurements , and is hoping to have an estimate soon . \n`` Give us about a week and we should have some preliminary numbers on that , '' he said . \n"}

I 'm assuming -- and I grant you , it 's an assumption -- I 'm making an assumption that , even though BP may have been telling the Coast Guard and others , we 're doing everything we can , EPA should have been there themselves verifying whether that 's true or not . \nAnd I think they just dropped the ball . \nI do n't think they care . \nCAVUTO : But , Michael , what 's to say we did n't have and do n't have guys like you in this administration now , the dirty little secret , despite you taking the bludgeoning you did during Katrina , is that you had warned that the response was n't adequate and might not be adequate , given the likely severity of something in the New Orleans area ? \nWe learned after the fact that your warnings were largely unheeded by both parties . \nHaving said that , how do we know that there is n't a guy like you making similar warnings now ? \nBROWN : I hope there is . \nAnd I hope that that person , that man or woman , whoever has been making those warnings , will do what I failed to do . \nAnd I have admitted this is a mistake . \nI should have walked away , found Neil Cavuto , walked up to his camera , and said , Neil , I have been saying for weeks this is not working and we need help . \nNow , Bush would have fired me anyway , but at least we would have gotten the attention we needed right away . \nAnd I just hope there 's somebody out there now that will do what I had failed to do . \nCAVUTO : All right . \nBut it was n't as if you failed to try . \nSo , I guess what I 'm asking here is , the media ... CAVUTO : But now what I 'm asking -- now what I 'm asking is whether you think the media , then , is giving this president a pass on this handling , and , to be fair , because the media still ca n't grasp the dimensions of this , so it is holding back ? \nBROWN : Well , Neil , with all due respect to you , come on . \nThe media ... CAVUTO : I 'm being fair and balanced , Michael . \nI 'm being fair and balanced . \nBROWN : I know . \nBut I do n't have to be . \nBROWN : The media has been ignoring it for two weeks . \nYou do n't think that there were -- look , they could have gotten on helicopters . \nThey probably were on helicopters . \nWe had other reconnaissance images from there . \nBut we only started to see them when it started to approach the Louisiana coast . \nAnd , then , oh , my God , look , we got to do something . \nI just -- I think the media sat back . \nAnd I would not be surprised if the White House said , you know , we might be able to , guess what , do what ? \nUse this crisis to our advantage . \nLet this crisis get really bad , and then we will step in . \nWe will be able to shut down offshore drilling . \nWe will be able to turn to all these alternate fuels . \nAnd I think the problem they have right now is , they waited too long . \nCAVUTO : So , by constantly referring to this as the BP still , the BP leak , the BP disaster , that there 's a method to that , right ? \nDid you ever hear during Katrina anyone asking Ray Nagin or Governor Blanco the questions about why did n't they evacuate , why did they choose the Superdome , how did you let people into the Convention Center ? \nYou heard none of that . \nCAVUTO : That 's a good point . \nBROWN : And , so , the media 's responsibility right now is , where was the EPA ? \nWhy was she out talking to David Letterman , instead of down on the Gulf Coast ? \nShe went to New Orleans . \nShe talked to community organizers . \nBROWN : Thank you , Neil . \nCAVUTO : Michael Brown , the former FEMA director . \nContent and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. . \nAll materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced , distributed , transmitted , displayed , published or broadcast without the prior written permission of Roll Call . \nYou may not alter or remove any trademark , copyright or other notice from copies of the content . \n"}
{"id": "698", "time": "2010-05-04", "text": "As a professional ornithologist , I am called to ponder the calamity now gushing forth in the Gulf of Mexico . \nIts most unnerving feature is that we can not begin to estimate how far-reaching its biological effects will be , let alone the scale of its economic impacts . \nThe most essential facts are still emerging , and changing , each day . \nHow much oil eventually will be released into the high seas ? \nHow far away will the havoc of this expanding oil spill be reached ? \nHow many hundreds -- or thousands -- of miles of coastline will be affected ? \nHow many oyster beds , sperm whale pods , bluefin tuna spawning beds , sea turtle beaches , and bird colonies will fall victim ? \nCan we ever measure accurately the accumulated effects of this disaster on commercial fishing , and tourism , and human happiness ? \nAmidst these uncertainties , some essential facts are important to bear in mind . \nThe Gulf of Mexico teems with life all year , and especially during spring days and nights when hundreds of millions of birds migrate northward across it . \nA large proportion of these will stop to replenish themselves at the very shorelines likely to be blackened by oil over the coming weeks . \nNews reports already feature hopelessly oiled birds being rushed to soapy `` rescues , '' but let 's not fool ourselves . \nThe biology of birds tarred at sea by crude oil is well known -- most will die , even among those few that are found and given a reprieve by well-meaning nature lovers . \nBirds are tough creatures when it comes to facing natural hazards -- after all , those that could not survive storms , droughts , floods , and fires through the millennia have long since died out without leaving descendants . \nBut birds were never built to handle environmental onslaughts of the scale we humans have thrown at them . \nIn the 1800s we exploited some of them to extinction . \nIn the 1900s we ransacked their habitats with wholesale conversion and industrial pollutants . \nNow , in the 21st century , we confront birds with burgeoning oil spews of unprecedented scale directly at the peak , and dead-center in the pathway , of their annual migration . \nDepending on wind directions over the coming weeks , breeding birds of Gulf Coast marshes and estuaries could end up paying the biggest price of all . \nThe most important point , however , is that doomed birds laden with oil are not , themselves , the story . \nRather , they play the familiar role of canaries in this coal mine . \nThe blackened gannets and pelicans we see on the evening news are messengers for a much , much larger story that is far harder to see or comprehend , much less to measure . \nUnwittingly , birds always have been effective communicators to humans , and today is no exception . \nThese oiled birds represent the headlines for myriad untold catastrophes that may unfold over the coming weeks : mass deaths of wildlife , reproductive failures , population crashes , and food-web collapses affecting literally thousands of species within the Gulf ecosystem . \nEvents like this can have ecological effects that may last decades , perhaps much longer . \nMore than 20 years after Exxon Valdez , we are still learning the facts about how populations and ecosystems respond to such unnatural disasters . \nCertainly , we need to avoid hand-wringing , and mobilize now to begin learning from this one . \nThe Deepwater Horizon gusher was generated by twenty-first century technology , but it symbolizes the nineteenth century ethics we continue to apply when environmental protection contradicts energy exploitation . \nAlthough we can not yet know the eventual scale of its biological and economic costs , we should , for once , agree that we must never again forget the fundamental lessons of this disaster . \nThe unthinkable is possible , and must be planned for in advance . \nAs we assess risks versus rewards , as we fully audit the true costs of energy exploration and extraction , we need to incorporate and properly mitigate the enormous risks and costs of disasters like Deepwater Horizon . \nFinally , with just one planet to steward and only one chance at this game , all of us should be called on to ponder whether some natural systems are just too complex and valuable to risk losing them , regardless of what temporary energy boost lies beneath them . \nJohn W.

{"id": "1281", "time": "2010-05-04", "text": "May 1 : Birds fly past oil booms that were placed in preparation of the looming oil spill from last week 's collapse and spill of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig along the shoreline , south of Venice , La. . \nNEW ORLEANS -- Restaurateurs , hotel owners , fishermen and beachfront property owners watched and waited for the weather and ocean currents to choose where a bulk of the oil from a calamitous Gulf of Mexico spill would finally wash ashore . \nThe consequences of the 200,000 gallons a day of crude spewing from a blown-out underwater well on those whose livelihoods rely on the richness of the sealife in the waters was obvious . \nFishing has been shut down in federal waters from the Mississippi River to the Florida Panhandle , leaving boats idle Monday in the middle of the prime spring season . \nA special shrimping season will close Tuesday evening . \nInns and restaurants that count on tourists attracted to the beautiful blue-green waters and sandy white beaches already are getting calls about the spill , which has flirted with the coastlines before receding , mostly because of the weather . \n`` You mentally want to push it back to the west , and then you feel guilty for doing so , '' said Jan Grant , manager at the St. George Inn on St. George Island , Fla. , about the path the spill might take . \nEngineers from BP PLC have failed to invent a solution to halt the gusher that 's been spewing into the sea since an offshore drilling platform blew up and sank last month and killed 11 workers . \nBP operated the rig that was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nChemical dispersants seemed to be helping to keep oil from floating to the surface , but crews have n't been able to activate a shutout valve underwater . \nAnd it could take another week before a 98-ton concrete-and-metal box is placed over one of the leaks to capture the oil . \nWorse , it could take three months to drill sideways into the well and plug it with mud and concrete to stop the worst U.S. oil spill since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska , leaking nearly 11 million gallons of crude . \nThose nowhere near the Gulf who drink coffee , eat shrimp , like fruit or plan to buy a new set of tires , could also end up paying for the disaster . \nSeveral river boat pilots said the edge of the slick Monday was 15 to 20 miles off the Southwest Pass , where ships headed to New Orleans enter the Mississippi River . \nA total shutdown of the shipping lanes is unlikely . \nHowever , there could be long delays if cargo vessels that move millions of tons of fruit , rubber , grain , steel and other commodities in and out of the nation 's interior are forced to wait to have their oil-coated hulls power-washed to avoid contaminating the Mississippi . \nSome cargo ships might choose to unload somewhere else in the U.S. . \nThat could drive up costs . \n`` Let 's say it gets real bad . \nIt gets blocked off and they do n't let anything in . \nThey lose time , and they are very concerned about that , '' said river pilot Michael Lorino . \n`` It 's going to be very costly if they have to unload that cargo in another port and ship it back here because it was destined for here . '' \nBP said Monday it would compensate people for `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' claims from the explosion and spill , but President Barack Obama and others pressed the company to explain exactly what that means . \nThose who packed a meeting at a Pensacola Beach church wanted to know the same thing . \nBetsy Robins , 58 , said she 's lost three houses to a hurricanes , a disaster Gulf Coasters dread but are more accustomed to facing . \nAn oil spill that might foul her properties -- that 's something she 's looking to the oil company to pay for . \nShe wants BP to buy her parcels at pre-slick prices . \n`` I do n't want to fight another claim , '' Robins said . \n`` I 've lost three houses to hurricanes so far . \nAnd spent 11 years fighting claims . '' \nFor the tourism industry , the spill could n't come at a worse time . \n`` It 's the beginning of the booking season , the beginning of the summer season , '' said Marie Curren , sales director for Brett\\/Robinson , a real estate firm in Gulf Shores , Ala. `` The only thing that could make it worst now is a hurricane . '' \nDana Powell expects at least some lost business at the Paradise Inn in Pensacola Beach , Fla. , and could see a different type of guest altogether : Instead of families boating , parasailing and fishing , workers on cleanup crews will probably be renting her rooms . \n`` They wo n't be having as much fun , '' she said , `` but they might be buying more liquor at the bar , because they 'll be so depressed . '' \nAnd what will she serve in her restaurant ? \nHamburgers and chicken fingers instead of crab claws . \nThe latest satellite image of the slick , taken Sunday night , indicates that it has shrunk since last week , but that only means some of the oil has gone underwater . \nThe new image found oil covering about 2,000 square miles , rather than the roughly 3,400 square miles observed last Thursday , said Hans Graber of the University of Miami . \nThe new image also shows that sizable patches have broken away and are moving to the north and east , Graber said . \nBy all accounts , the disaster is certain to cost BP billions . \nBut analysts said the company could handle it ; BP is the world 's third-largest oil company and made more than $ 6 billion in the first three months of this year . \nThe oil spill has drained $ 32 billion from BP 's stock market value . \nIn the Chandeleur Sound on Monday , about 40 miles northeast of Venice , La. , thick , heavy oil formed long clumps that looked like raw sewage . \nDying jellyfish could be seen in the water . \nSea turtles have been found dead on Mississippi beaches , but necropsies on five of the 30 did not find evidence they died from the effects of oil . \nThe news was better from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle , where the sheen is n't expected to touch beaches before Thursday . \nWind and sea currents have helped to keep the oil away from points farther west , said Coast Guard Capt. Steve Poulin . \nSome businesses were prepared because of their experience during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \nFolgers Coffee Co. , which ships its coffee through the Port of New Orleans , has several weeks ' worth of green coffee on hand and has made arrangements to use other ports in the event of a shutdown , spokeswoman Mary Beth Badertscher said . \n`` We 've learned a lot of valuable lessons from Hurricane Katrina about supply logistics , '' she said . \nAbout 60 percent of the grain exported from the U.S. goes through the Southwest Pass . \nIf the spill delays barge traffic going down the Mississippi , prices for corn , soybeans and wheat could rise quickly on global markets , said Greg Wagner , a commodity analyst . \nGrain prices within the U.S. could actually fall if shipments are unable to leave the U.S. and the grain begins piling up at silos in the U.S. . \nBut the price decreases would probably be small and would n't show up at the grocery store anytime soon , said Seth Meyer , an agricultural transportation analyst at the University of Missouri . \nIn Alabama , scores of shrimp boats sat at dock in Bayou La Batre , their crews unable to work . \nVietnamese immigrant Minh V.

Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One on May 2 as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. . \n`` Let me be clear : BP is responsible for this leak ; BP will be paying the bill , '' Obama said while touring the area Sunday . \nWhile it 's true that the federal Oil Pollution Act , enacted in 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , makes BP responsible for cleanup costs , the law caps the company 's liability for economic damages -- such as lost wages , shortened fishing seasons or lagging tourism -- at $ 75 million , a pittance compared to potential losses . \nAdministration officials insist BP will be held responsible anyway , noting that if the company is found negligent or criminally liable , the cap disappears . \nClaims also can potentially be made under other state or federal laws , officials said . \nYet the liability cap is problematic enough that a trio of Democratic senators introduced legislation Monday raising it to $ 10 billion , and the administration quickly announced its support . \nSens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida voiced concerns that unless the cap is raised , BP would avoid paying for the mess and leave small businesses , local government and fishermen with the bill . \n`` They 're not going to want to pay any more than what the law says they have to , '' Nelson said . \nThat 's not quite the seemingly ironclad guarantee heard from the president . \nThen there 's the administration 's rhetoric about anticipating the magnitude of the crisis and bringing all resources to bear on Day One . \n`` We had -LRB- Defense Department -RRB- resources there from Day One . \nThis was a situation that was treated as a possible catastrophic failure from , from Day One , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Sunday on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' \nThat sense of urgency was not so apparent when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was questioned about the incident April 23 , three days after it occurred . \nAt the time he seemed to dismiss its severity and indicated it would n't affect Obama 's plans to open up new areas of the coast to offshore drilling . \n`` I do n't honestly think it opens up a whole new series of questions , because , you know , in all honesty I doubt this is the first accident that has happened and I doubt it will be the last , '' Gibbs said . \nA week later , Obama was announcing plans for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to review whether new technologies were needed to safeguard against oil spills from deep-water drilling rigs . \nThe president said no new offshore oil drilling leases would be issued without any such safeguards . \nAnd Napolitano 's comments over the weekend about the Pentagon 's Day One role seemed a change from last Thursday , when she seemed to indicate the Defense Department was not yet involved in responding to the spill : `` If and when they have something to add , we 'll certainly make that known , '' she said . \nA Homeland Security spokesman , Sean Smith , said Napolitano 's more recent comments referred to the Navy 's help with the Coast Guard 's search and rescue mission early on , and that when she was discussing the Defense Department last Thursday she was alluding to any additional help they could bring to bear . \nThe administration 's evolving rhetoric reflects not only the increasing seriousness of the spill itself , but its determination to be seen as responsive from the get-go and to squelch comparisons to the Bush administration 's slow-footed response to Hurricane Katrina . \nIt 's only natural that administration officials would adjust their response as the spill worsened and its seriousness became evident . \nBut they invite judgment when claiming they responded at 100 percent starting Day One to an incident whose magnitude was not yet apparent , or when black-and-white assertions about taxpayer protections turn out to be tinged with gray . \n"}
{"id": "1492", "time": "2010-09-09", "text": "BP was preparing to plug its well 50 miles off the Louisiana coast , and longtime technical adviser Jesse Gagliano was running computer models to finalize details . \n`` We have a potential problem here , '' the Halliburton employee told three colleagues he met in the hallway in BP PLC 's Houston headquarters . \nHe said his computer model was predicting a `` serious gas flow problem '' with BP 's well abandonment plan . \nHis idea for addressing the issue would never be carried out . \nBP decided it was n't necessary . \nFive days later , on April 20 , the well blew out , causing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nIn an internal report released Wednesday , BP stood by its decision , saying Gagliano 's plan would not have stopped the explosion . \nThe disagreement was just one of several that emerged in the days and hours before the blast , according to BP 's report and e-mails , documents and testimony gathered by federal investigators . \nConfusion surrounded crucial tasks and frustration rose among people involved . \nThe cause of the explosion , which killed 11 workers , remains under investigation by federal authorities . \nBut as more information trickles out , the image of a high-stakes , high seas venture collapsing in disarray is sharpening . \nThe mile-deep exploratory well was being capped with cement so it could be abandoned until a production phase later . \nBP operated the well , Transocean owned the rig and Halliburton carried out the cement job . \nThey had to work together . \nYet key plans kept changing . \nCritical tests meant to ensure the well would be safely cemented were not going smoothly . \nBP accepts some of the blame for decisions that led to the blowout , but its report also assigns fault to Transocean and Halliburton workers . \nThose companies , in turn , point the finger at BP 's well design . \nThe head of the Deepwater Horizon rig , who was most familiar with its crew and operations , had left for training and was replaced by Bob Kaluza , who was less familiar with earlier problems surrounding the well . \nThe operation was running 45 days late and millions of dollars over budget . \nGagliano 's computer model exposed yet another possible problem . \nThe longtime technical adviser concluded that the cementing operation needed more centralizers , devices designed to ensure that the casing -- or drilling pipe -- runs down the center of the wellbore to increase the chance for a perfect seal and prevent leaks . \nBP had planned to run six centralizers and had them onboard . \nAfter a corridor chat with BP 's senior drilling engineer , Gagliano worked up more models . \nBy the evening of April 15 , Gagliano had a model with 21 centralizers that resolved the gas flow problem . \nThe 15 additional centralizers were acquired and scheduled for delivery the next morning , in time for the Halliburton cementers to do the job . \nStill , the debate did n't end . \nBP drilling engineer Brett Cocales learned the next afternoon , April 16 , that his company 's engineers had decided against using the additional centralizers because of questions about their mechanical integrity . \nMembers of a BP investigation panel said Wednesday that those concerns were unfounded because engineers were mistaken about which centralizers had been shipped . \nIn an e-mail to fellow drilling engineer Brian Morel , Cocales explained the extra centralizers could help meet the goal of inserting the casing properly . \nThen he continued : `` But who cares ? \nWe 'll probably get a good cement job , '' he wrote , frustrated it had taken so long to make a decision . \nA few hours later , Halliburton cementer Nathaniel Chaisson , who was already on the rig , also learned the additional centralizers would not be used and notified Gagliano , who he said seemed concerned . \nOn April 19 , Gagliano 's models still showed that using only six centralizers raised the risk of a failed cement job . \nStill in Houston , he participated in the daily morning call with the rig . \nThe centralizers were n't mentioned . \nHe did n't raise the issue . \n`` BP made their decision , '' Gagliano recalled when testifying before a federal panel . \nHe thought the worst-case scenario would be that they would have to go back to fix the cement job after it was completed . \nMonths later , BP is defending the decision . \nIn Wednesday 's report , the company said the decision not to use 21 centralizers likely did n't contribute to the cement 's failure . \nMeanwhile , the well lining job , known as casing , was completed . \nThe casing , critical to ensuring no gas slips out of the wellbore uncontrolled , looked good , paving the way for that night 's cementing . \nThe cement would essentially seal the gap between the well casing and the hole drilled in the seafloor . \nIt would also shut in the well until the day BP was ready to extract oil and gas . \nAt 9 p.m. April 19 , the Halliburton workers began the complicated cement job 5,000 feet below the surface . \nSometime during the night , Chaisson , the Halliburton cementer , noticed a BP drilling engineer calling Houston headquarters . \n`` We may have blown something out higher in the casing , '' the engineer said , triggering a flurry of phone calls between the rig and Houston . \nUltimately , they continued the job and Chaisson did not indicate there was ever discussion to halt the work . \nSince then , however , BP has said it found weaknesses in the design and testing of the cement . \nIt said the weaknesses may have allowed hydrocarbons to escape from the wellbore , causing the blowout . \nHalliburton insists the problem was not in the cement but in BP 's design of the well . \nBy 1 a.m. , on April 20 , the cement job was completed . \n`` We have completed the job and it went well , '' Chaisson wrote to Gagliano in an e-mail at 5:44 a.m. Confidence was up . \nYet at the 11 a.m. meeting , rig leader Jimmy Harrell was unhappy . \nBP 's plan for shutting down operations did n't include a `` negative pressure test '' -- a procedure that reduces the fluid pressure in the well to ensure there are no gas leaks . \nHarrell learned a long time ago this was risky . \nHe demanded the test . \nMeanwhile , in Houma , La. , a group of VIPs -- BP executives Pat O'Bryan and David Sims , and Transocean executives Daun Winslow and Buddy Trahan -- boarded a helicopter headed for the Deepwater Horizon . \nThey were going for a 24-hour `` visibility '' visit to one of their best-performing Gulf rigs . \nThey arrived on the rig floor as the negative test was going on . \nWinslow realized there was confusion over the pressures -- indicating there might be a leak somewhere in the wellbore -- and decided it was not a good environment for the group . \n`` Let 's let these guys get back to work , '' he said , taking the VIPs to the pontoon area . \nHarrell and a Transocean toolpusher , Randy Ezell , stayed to help with the test . \nKaluza , the BP company man , was not satisfied . \nHe got permission from Houston to run a second test . \nAfter dinner , Chris Pleasant , a Transocean subsea supervisor , went to the drill shack to begin his shift . \nHe was told that 60 barrels of mud appeared to have been lost during the pressure test . \nIdeally , rig workers like to see little or no mud lost in the test . \nLosing too much mud can signal a leak in the casing -- which could cause an oil spill , or in the worst-case scenario , allow gas and highly explosive methane to seep through the casing , leading to a blowout . \nWyman Wheeler , a Transocean toolpusher , said something was n't right . \nHe ended his shift and was relieved by Jason Anderson . \nAn argument erupted over how to do the second negative test . \nAnderson wanted it done as it had always been done on the Horizon , and finally persuaded the BP crew . \nBy 8 p.m. , the test had ended . \n`` Go call the office , '' BP 's well site leader Don Vidrine told his counterpart , Kaluza . \n`` Tell them we 're going to displace the well '' -- a critical task in which the mud that keeps the oil and gas under control is replaced with seawater before the well is closed and abandoned . \nVidrine 's decision to proceed may have been a fateful one . \nBP now believes that Transocean and BP supervisors misinterpreted the results of the negative-pressure tests . \nWhile workers removed mud from the well , the VIPs ended a meeting with the rig leadership and headed for the bridge . \nCapt. Curt Kuchta showed them the controls and the radar . \nDavid Sims of BP got in a video-game-like machine that simulates piloting the rig . \nWinslow went to have a cigarette . \nThe phone on the rig floor rang . \nIt was Ezell , who had reluctantly gone to dinner and was asking about the test results . \n`` It went good , '' Anderson responded . \n`` What about your displacement ? \nHow 's it going ? '' \n`` It 's going fine , '' Anderson answered . \nBut the rig crew apparently missed warning signs that oil and gas had entered the well . \nBP investigators suspect the rig crew was distracted by other `` end-of-well activities . '' \nIt was 9:30 when Ezell followed Anderson 's instructions and went to his cabin . \nHe chatted with his wife . \nThen he turned off the lights and laid down to watch TV . \nEight minutes later , unbeknownst to Anderson , hydrocarbons started to shoot toward the rig . \nThree minutes later , rig workers started trying to control the well , but by then , mud was already flowing unchecked onto the rig floor . \nPleasant , the Transocean subsea supervisor , was doing paperwork . \nHe had the rig leader sign some documents . \nSenior toolpusher Randy Harrell closed out some permits and went to take a shower . \nOn the bridge , Sims got out of the simulator . \nThe phone rang in Ezell 's bunk . \n`` We have a situation , '' an assistant driller said . \n`` The well is blown out . \nWe have mud going to the crown . '' \n`` Do y ' all have it shut in ? '' \nEzell asked , horrified . \n`` Jason is shutting it in now , '' Curtis responded . \n`` Randy , we need your help . '' \nEzell jumped into his coveralls , shoved his feet into boots , grabbed his hardhat and ran . \nIn Pleasant 's office , a rig worker looked over . \n`` Chris , what 's that water ? '' \nhe asked , apparently seeing the fluid rising from the well and onto the rig . \n`` They 're probably coming out the hole , '' Pleasant answered , fixated on the computer screen . \n`` I see mud , '' the worker said . \nHe called the rig floor . \n`` We got to go , '' Pleasant said , and took off down the hall . \nIt was nearly 10 p.m. O'Bryan was in the simulator . \nSims was on the bridge . \nHarrell was in the shower . \nEzell was running to the rig floor . \nThe captain opened the portside door and saw fluid pouring onto the rig . \nAssociated Press writer Michael Kunzelman in New Orleans contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nManufacturers argue that prompt use of such detergents , also called dispersants , can move oil more rapidly to those microbes . \nBut BP announced late Wednesday that it would halt dispersant of the chemicals while agencies further assess its environmental impact . \nDispersants work on an oil spill as dishwashing detergent works on a greasy skillet : They break up oil into tiny droplets that sink below the water 's surface where naturally occurring bacteria consume them . \nWithout dispersants , oil stays on the water 's surface , where bacteria ca n't get at them , said Mani Ramesh , chief technology officer of dispersant manufacturer Nalco . \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved 14 dispersants for use on oil spills , including Corexit 9500 , which Nalco produces . \nCrews battling the spill have already used more than 156,000 gallons of dispersants including Corexit . \nNalco has exhausted its entire inventory and is producing more , said Mani Ramesh , Nalco 's chief technology officer . \nRamesh said Corexit 's active ingredient is an emulsifier also found in ice cream ; he disputed environmental groups ' claims that it is harmful to marine life , although the exact chemical make up of the the product is a trade secret . \nCoast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry , the federal on-scene coordinator , called the tests so far `` very promising , very promising . '' \nHe told the Associated Press that sonar and camera images from the first test last week appeared to show a reduction in oil on the surface , although federal officials said they want more information from planes that will examine the leak site from the air . \nThe problem , according to Jackie Savitz , a senior scientist at the marine environmental group Oceana , is that the dispersants themselves can be toxic to wildlife . \nDispersants can also enhance oil 's toxicity in the dispersion process . \n`` A decision is being made where it 's the shore wildlife and oysters and beaches versus the animals that live in the water , '' Savitz said . \n`` When they use a dispersant , it 's taking the oil and essentially dissolving it in the water so that it does n't wash up on the beach . '' \nHazen cities the aftermath of the Amoco Cadiz and the Exxon Valdez disasters , two spills where chemical detergents led to ecological problems . \nIn 1978 , the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz split in two three miles off the coast of Normandy , releasing about 227,000 tons heavy crude oil that ultimately stained nearly 200 miles of coastline . \nThe spill site was so large that only the areas of greatest economic impact were treated with detergents . \nLarge areas in the more remote parts of the coast went untreated . \n`` The untreated coastal areas were fully recovered within five years of the Amoco Cadiz spill , '' says Hazen . \n`` As for the treated areas , ecological studies show that 30 years later , those areas still have not recovered . '' \nA combination of detergents and bioremediation were used to clean up the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez . \nThe detergents were nutrient rich , being high in phosphorous and nitrogen compounds . \nIn addition , as part of the bioremediation effort , fertilizers were also used to promote microbial growth . \nAfter the first year , the treated areas were dramatically cleaner , Hazen says , but after the second year no improvements were observed . \nLong-term prospects for the treated area are grim . \n`` What happened was that we took a low-nutrient environment and added lots of nutrients to it to speed up the degradation of the oil , which we probably did , '' Hazen says . \n`` However , we upset the ecological balance of the system , which could not handle the influx of nutrients . \nAs a result , the severe environmental damage resulting from the spill is expected to persist for decades to come . '' \nImprovements to detergents have been made over the years , including some degree of biodegradability . \nAllison Nyholm , a policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute , noted that current dispersants are different from the thick solvents used in 1967 on an oil spill off the California coast at Santa Barbara . \nBut all agree that short of capping the leak , there are few good solutions to this ecological disaster . \nReuters contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nThe seas calmed Tuesday allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore in places might turn into a heavier coating of oil . \nCrews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . \nThey also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface , possibly Wednesday . \nChemical dispersants piped 5,000 feet to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . \nThe company also hoped to shut off one of the smaller of three leaks though it might not reduce the flow much , said Doug Suttles , BP PLC 's chief operating officer . \nForecasts showed the oil was n't expected to come ashore until at least Thursday . \n`` It 's a gift of a little bit of time . \nI 'm not resting , '' U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \nFrom the air Tuesday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . \nThat would take months , however . \nAcross the accident zone , oil floated in the ocean in different hues , shapes and textures . \nIn places , it was a rich paisley patterned reds and oranges . \nIn others , it took on varying gray and blue striated shapes , almost like a Vincent Van Gogh 's thick brush strokes . \nPeople along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when that huge slick might come ashore , ruining their beaches -- and their livelihoods . \nThe anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . \nAnd even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are just sure the flow of crude unleashed by the explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon is the culprit . \nThe rig was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nSome of the 115 surviving workers who were aboard when it exploded are suing that company and BP PLC. . \nIn lawsuits filed Tuesday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours while the rig burned uncontrollably . \nThey are seeking damages . \nGuy Cantwell , a spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. , defended the company 's response , saying 115 workers did get off alive . \nTwo wrongful death suits also have been filed . \nIn their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 2.5 million gallons a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 1.7 million gallons . \nA rainbow sheen of oil has reached land in parts of Louisiana , but the gooey rafts of coagulated crude have yet to come ashore in most places . \nWhile officials worked on cleanup , the long wait took its toll on nerves and incomes . \n`` It 's aggravating , to a point , '' said Frank Besson , 61 , owner of Nez Coupe Souvenir & Tackle . \n`` You got people canceling out , thinking we 've got oil on the beaches , and it 's not even at the mouth of the Mississippi . '' \nFishermen have complained bitterly about the federal decision to close a large swath of the Gulf to commercial and sport fishing , saying it was an overreaction . \nSome even vowed to keep catching fish until someone arrested them . \nBut U.S. Sen. David Vitter said it was necessary to reassure the American public that the seafood on restaurant menus and store shelves is safe . \n`` We do n't want hysteria to take over and hysteria to hurt the industry even more than the oil is , '' said Vitter , R-La . \nDaryl Carpenter , president of the Louisiana Charter Boat Association , is struggling to get people to understand that three-quarters of the Gulf is still clean and open to fishing . \nIn Gulf Shores , Ala. , the real estate firm Brett\\/Robinson Vacations , sent a note to those renting vacation properties that they would not be penalized for any spill-related cancellations , but urged them not to jump the gun . \n`` There are many questions and many ` what ifs ' regarding this event , '' the message read . \n`` Because changes come about hourly and 30 days is a long way away , we are asking you to wait before canceling your vacation , especially those of you who are scheduled to arrive more than 30 days from today . '' \nThere are legitimate concerns , experts say . \nA second bird found in the slick , a brown pelican , is recovering at a bird rescue center in Louisiana . \nNational Wildlife Federation president and CEO Larry Schweiger says there 's no way to know how many birds have been oiled because the slick is so big and so far offshore . \nPerdido Key , a barrier island between Pensacola and the Alabama state line with sugar-white sand studded with condominiums , likely would be the first place in Florida affect by the oil spill . \nPerdido -- Spanish for `` Lost '' -- got a sniff Tuesday morning of what may be in store . \n`` You could smell the smell of it , real heavy petroleum base , '' said Steve Ownesby , 54 , a maintenance man at the Flora-Bama Lounge abutting the state line on the Florida side . \nThe air cleared later , but Owensby 's 28-year-old daughter , Stephanie , who tends bar at the lounge , said some visitors have complained of feeling ill from the fumes . \n`` It 's very sad because I grew up out here , '' she said . \n`` I remember growing up seeing the white beaches my whole life . \nEvery day I 've been going to the beach ... a lot of people are out watching and crying .

'' \nCommunications Director Dan Pfeiffer repeated this assertion on the White House blog this week and added : `` The bottom line is that the administration will aggressively pursue compensation from BP for any damages from this spill . '' \nIt 's understandable why the White House is quick to point out exceptions to the cap : The total cost of economic damages from the oil spill is expected to easily exceed the $ 75 million liability limit and the tide in the Gulf of Mexico moves faster than the tide of Congress . \nThe Senate is seeking to raise the cap of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to $ 10 billion . \nThe White House wo n't endorse a specific dollar limit but Gibbs said Wednesday that the administration `` would be in favor of significantly lifting '' the current $ 75 million cap . \nIt 's unclear how much BP will ultimately have to pay but analysts estimate the company is facing billions in containment and clean-up expenses . \n`` This figure is rising as activity increases , '' the company said in a written statement . \n`` It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . '' \nBP says it is spending more than $ 6 million a day to try and contain the oil slick and just announced $ 25 million grants for four Gulf Coast states affected by the oil spill . \nBut that does n't include federal and state spending , such as the deployment of National Guard troops , that BP is responsible for reimbursing . \nThe Pentagon just approved requests from Louisiana and Mississippi for 6,000 Guard members each , Alabama for 3,000 and Florida for 2,500 . \nSen.

'' \n`` The question is , who 's going to make those businesses and families whole again , '' the aide told FoxNews.com . \n`` In an instance like this , $ 75 million would be a drop in the bucket compared to what local businesses , fisheries and landowners need to be made whole . '' \nThe White House has not ruled out requesting supplemental funds from Congress to help pay for the cleanup now , but a request has not been made . \n`` We are monitoring the whole situation and what the impact will be on businesses , communities and individuals in the Gulf Coast , '' Kenneth Baer , spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget , told FoxNews.com . \n`` But it 's too soon to say whether we need to request supplemental funds from Congress .

Mary Landry said . \nIn their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 2.5 million gallons a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 1.7 million gallons . \nIn an exploration plan filed with the government in February 2009 , BP said it could handle a `` worst-case scenario '' it described as a leak of 6.8 million gallons per day from an uncontrolled blowout . \nContainment boxes have never been tried at this depth -- about 5,000 feet -- because of the extreme water pressure . \nIf all goes well , the contraption could be fired up early next week to start funneling the oil into a tanker . \n`` We do n't know for sure '' whether the equipment will work , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . \n`` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modeling and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us . '' \nThe seas calmed Tuesday , allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore in places might turn into a heavier coating of oil . \nCrews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . \nThey also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface , possibly Wednesday . \nChemical dispersants piped 5,000 feet to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . \nFrom the air Tuesday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . \nThat will take months . \nPeople along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when the huge slick might come ashore , ruining their beaches -- and their livelihoods . \nThe anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . \nAnd even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are just sure the flow of crude unleashed by the explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon is the culprit . \nThe rig was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nSome of the 115 surviving workers who were aboard when it exploded are suing that company and BP PLC. . \nIn lawsuits filed Tuesday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours while the rig burned uncontrollably . \nThey are seeking damages . \nGuy Cantwell , a spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. , defended the company 's response , saying 115 workers did get off alive . \nTwo wrongful death suits also have been filed . \nWhile officials worked on cleanup , the long wait took its toll on nerves and incomes . \nIn Gulf Shores , Ala. , the real estate firm Brett\\/Robinson Vacations sent a note to those renting vacation properties that they would not be penalized for any spill-related cancellations , but urged them not to jump the gun . \n`` There are many questions and many ` what ifs ' regarding this event , '' the message read . \n`` Because changes come about hourly and 30 days is a long way away , we are asking you to wait before canceling your vacation , especially those of you who are scheduled to arrive more than 30 days from today . '' \nThere are legitimate concerns , experts say . \nA second bird found in the slick , a brown pelican , is recovering at a bird rescue center in Louisiana . \nNational Wildlife Federation president and CEO Larry Schweiger says there 's no way to know how many birds have been oiled because the slick is so big and so far offshore . \nPerdido Key , a barrier island between Pensacola and the Alabama state line with sugar-white sand studded with condominiums , likely would be the first place in Florida affect by the oil spill . \nPerdido -- Spanish for `` Lost '' -- got a sniff Tuesday morning of what may be in store . \n`` You could smell the smell of it , real heavy petroleum base , '' said Steve Ownesby , 54 , a maintenance man at the Flora-Bama Lounge abutting the state line on the Florida side . \nThe air cleared later , but Owensby 's 28-year-old daughter , Stephanie , who tends bar at the lounge , said some visitors have complained of feeling ill from the fumes . \n`` It 's very sad because I grew up out here , '' she said . \n`` I remember growing up seeing the white beaches my whole life . \nEvery day I 've been going to the beach ... a lot of people are out watching and crying .

'' \nAccountants have been trying to nail down the implications for thousands of taxpayers after President Barack Obama said BP would create a $ 20 billion disaster fund and provide another $ 100 million for oil workers who lose their jobs because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . \nOil has been gushing into the sea since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nTax experts said generally all income is taxable under federal law unless specific exemptions are approved by Congress or the Treasury Department -- and neither has acted yet on oil spill damage claims . \nThe IRS would not comment on whether exemptions would be made , citing a policy of not answering questions on specific tax issues . \nAdding to the confusion , Kenneth Feinberg , who was chosen by President Barack Obama and BP to oversee the Independent Claims Facility , said Friday it has n't been determined if the payouts will be considered taxable income . \nSome tax experts said they expected federal action soon to clarify the situation for Gulf Coast residents and business owners . \n`` With the experience we 've had with tornadoes and hurricanes , they know they need to address this , '' said John Ams , executive vice president of the Alexandria , Va.-based National Society of Accountants . \nIt 's not the first time the region has dealt with whether disaster money should be taxed . \nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Louisiana and Mississippi residents received federal money to rebuild their homes after many claimed a casualty loss for the damage on the 2005 tax returns . \nThe IRS initially required people who received the money and took the deduction to add the value of the deduction to their 2007 returns as taxable income . \nThat decision angered many residents , including some who were pushed into a higher tax bracket as a result . \nAfter residents and local leaders protested , Congress in 2008 voted to negate the IRS decision . \nWithout any such decision yet from federal authorities , tax experts are advising people getting BP payments to do a bit of advance planning and set aside some money . \n`` They should do a projection of their taxable income and determine if there is going to be a tax liability and have enough to cover that , '' said Crystal Faulkner , a partner in the Cincinnati-based accounting firm of Cooney Faulkner & Stevens LLC . \nThat does n't sit well with Cherie Edwards , who is now only working one day a week at her job booking charter fishing trips at Zeke 's Landing in Orange Beach , Ala. . \nThe lost hours due to the oil spill are costing her about $ 270 week . \nShe said she got her claim number from BP on Thursday and plans to file an application in the coming day . \nSo far , she said , no one has mentioned to her about a potential tax liability . \nAssociated Press writers Jay Reeves in Alabama and Shelia Byrd in Mississippi contributed to this report . \n"}

'' \nGates said there is a standing offer for the authorization of up to 17,500 National Guard troops in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , the four states that are most affected by the BP spill . \n`` If there 's anything people think we can do , we absolutely will do it , '' he said . \nGates authorized the troops under Title 32 status , which means all costs would be reimbursed by the federal government , which in turn is charging BP . \nOf the 6,000 troops it is authorized to deploy , Louisiana has activated about 1,100 for aviation support , sandbagging and hazmat training for those who might come in contact with the oil . \nAlabama has activated 450 of the 3,000 troops authorized . \nTroops in that state are helping local business owners and others file claims against BP . \nMississippi has activated 50 of its 6,000 authorized troops , and Florida has activated 30 of its 2,500 to conduct aviation support . \nSpokesmen for the four states ' governors rejected the notion that politics is a factor in how many troops they activate . \n`` It 's a question of is there a function for the National Guard to perform on the Gulf Coast , '' said Dan Turner , a spokesman for Mississippi Gov.

'' \nBP officials said they sympathized and planned to do more . \n`` For BP , our intent is to restore the Gulf the way it was before it happened , '' BP PLC managing director Bob Dudley , who has taken over the company 's spill operations , said in Washington . \n-- The federal judge who struck down the Obama administration 's six-month ban on deep-water drilling in the Gulf refused to stay his ruling while the government appeals . \n-- Environmental groups asked the court to release additional information about U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman 's holdings in oil-related stocks . \n-- Dudley said BP had asked James Lee Witt , director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration during the Clinton administration , to review its response to the oil spill and recommend improvements . \nAt nearly every important juncture since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers , the government 's and BP 's estimates on the size of the spill , its effect on wildlife and the time frame for containing it have spectacularly missed the mark . \nOn June 8 , BP chief operating office Doug Suttles said the spill should be reduced to a `` relative trickle '' in less than a week . \nBP later said it would take more time for the spill to reach a trickle . \nPresident Barack Obama told the nation last week that as much as 90 percent would soon be captured , saying the company had informed him that was how much of the oil could be kept out of the water within weeks . \n`` It just does n't look like that 's in the cards , '' said Ed Overton , a retired professor of environmental science at Louisiana State University . \n`` We 're not even close to that , and the word today is that they were capturing less than the day before . \nI was hoping the president knew something that the rest of us did n't know . \nI mean , he was talking to the big shots . '' \nBP said Thursday it was gradually ramping back up to capture about 700,000 gallons a day with the cap , and burning off an additional 438,000 a day using an incinerator ship . \nWorst-case government estimates are that about 2.5 million gallons are leaking from the well , though no one really knows for sure . \nBy mid - to late July , the company hopes to have the capacity to capture up to 3.3 million gallons a day , if that much is flowing , BP spokesman John Curry said . \nIt can not all be done immediately , Curry said , because the logistics of positioning four giant ships capable of collecting oil and connecting them to the seafloor are complicated . \n`` There 's a limit to the number of ships in the world that do these type of things , '' he said . \nNone of those efforts is expected to stop the leak entirely . \nThe soonest that would happen is late August , which is when BP says relief wells being drilled through thousands of feet of rock beneath the seabed will reach the gusher . \nAugust seems a long way off to many . \nAlong Pensacola Beach , lifeguard Collin Cobia wore a red handkerchief over his nose and mouth to block the oil smell . \n`` It 's enough to knock you down , '' he said . \nOthers were n't happy about the situation but declined to second-guess the BP engineers . \n`` I have no clue at all about the correct way to stop it , '' said Rocky Ditcharo , a seafood dock owner in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish .

{"id": "1068", "time": "2010-05-02", "text": "May 1 : Birds fly past oil booms that were placed in preparation of the looming oil spill from last week 's collapse and spill of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig along the shoreline , south of Venice , La. . \nVENICE , Louisiana -- BP 's chairman defended his company 's safety record and said Sunday that `` a failed piece of equipment '' was to blame for a massive oil spill along the Gulf Coast , where President Barack Obama was headed for a firsthand update on the slick creeping toward American shores . \nBP PLC chairman Lamar McKay told ABC 's `` This Week '' that he ca n't say when the well a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- beneath the sea might be plugged . \nBut he said he believes a dome that could be placed over the well is expected to be deployed in six to eight days . \nThe dome has been made and workers are finishing the plan to get it deployed , McKay said . \nHe said BP officials are still working to activate a `` blowout preventer '' mechanism meant to seal off the geyser of oil . \n`` And as you can imagine , this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- , with -- in the dark , with robot-controlled submarines , '' McKay said . \nBP spokesman Bill Salvin said McKay was talking about the blowout preventer as the failed equipment that caused the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 people . \nThe blowout preventer typically activates after a blast or other event to cut off any oil that may spill . \nThe cause of the blast remains undetermined , and Salvin said `` we 're not ruling anything out . '' \nCrews have had little success stemming the flow from the ruptured well on the sea floor off Louisiana or removing oil from the surface by skimming it , burning it or dispersing it with chemicals . \nThe churning slick of dense , rust-colored oil is now roughly the size of Puerto Rico . \nAdding to the gloomy outlook were warnings from experts that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream current carries it toward the Atlantic . \nLong tendrils of oil sheen made their way into South Pass , a major channel through the salt marshes of Louisiana 's southeastern bootheel that is a breeding ground for crab , oysters , shrimp , redfish and other seafood . \nVenice charter boat captain Bob Kenney lamented that there was no boom in the water to corral the oil , and said BP was `` pretty much over their head in the deep water . '' \n`` If they were n't , they would have cut the oil off by now , '' he said . \n`` It 's like a slow version of Katrina , '' he added . \n`` My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . '' \nAbout a half-dozen fishing vessels sailed Sunday morning through the marshes of coastal St. Bernard Parish in eastern Louisiana , headed for the Biloxi Wildlife Management area . \nThe oyster and shrimp boats , laden with boom , hoped to seal off inlets , bayous and bays . \nThere is growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster , which cast a pall over the region 's economy and fragile environment . \nMoving to blunt criticism that the Obama administration has been slow in reacting to the largest U.S. crude oil spill in decades , the White House dispatched two Cabinet members to make the rounds on the Sunday television talk shows . \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that the government has taken an `` all hands on deck '' approach to the spill since the BP oil well ruptured . \nNapolitano said that as BP officials realized more oil was spewing than first thought , the government has coordinated federal , state and local resources with the oil company 's response . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that it could take three months before workers attain what he calls the `` ultimate solution '' to stopping the leak -- drilling a relief well more than 3 miles -LRB- 5 kilometers -RRB- below the ocean floor . \nHowever , as the spill surged toward disastrous proportions , critical questions lingered : Who created the conditions that caused the gusher ? \nDid BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days ? \nAnd , most important , how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse ? \nThe Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated the well was spewing at least 200,000 gallons -LRB- 757,000 liters -RRB- a day . \nEven at that rate , the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks . \nBut a growing number of experts warned that the situation may already be much worse . \nThe oil slick over the water 's surface appeared to triple in size over the past two days , which could indicate an increase in the rate oil is pouring from the well , according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami . \nWhile it 's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth , images do indicate growth , experts said . \n`` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , '' said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing . \nIn an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in February 2009 , BP said it had the capability to handle a `` worst-case scenario '' at the site , which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout -- 6.8 million gallons -LRB- 26 million liters -RRB- each day . \nOil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what , exactly , a worst-case scenario would look like . \nBut if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and carries it to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially loops around the state 's southern tip and up the eastern seaboard -- several experts said it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions . \n`` It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time , '' Graber said . \n`` I do n't think we can prevent that . \nIt 's more of a question of when rather than if . '' \nThe concerns are both environmental and economic . \nThe fishing industry is worried marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway . \nTourism officials are worried vacationers wo n't want to visit oil-tainted beaches . \nAnd environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds , coral and mammals in and near the Gulf . \n`` We know they are out there , '' said Meghan Calhoun , a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans . \n`` Unfortunately , the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us . '' \nFishermen and boaters want to help but have been hampered by high winds and rough waves that render oil-catching booms largely ineffective . \nSome coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP was hampering mitigation efforts . \n`` No , I 'm not happy with the protection , but I 'm sure the oil company is saving money , '' said 57-year-old Raymond Schmitt , in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour . \nAnd the oil on the surface is just part of the problem . \nLouisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well . \nIf that happens , there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating . \n`` When these things go , they go KABOOM , '' he said . \n`` If this thing does collapse , we 've got a big , big blow . '' \nBP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping . \nA company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels . \nObama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . \nAs if to cut off mounting criticism , on Saturday White House spokesman Robert Gibbs posted a blog entitled `` The Response to the Oil Spill , '' laying out the administration 's day-by-day response since the explosion , using words like `` immediately '' and `` quickly , '' and emphasizing that Obama `` early on '' directed responding agencies to devote every resource to the incident and determining its cause . \n"}

'' \nMore than 6,800 square miles of federal fishing areas , from the mouth of the Mississippi to Florida 's Pensacola Bay were closed for at least 10 days on Sunday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nNOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco says government scientists are taking samples from the waters near the spill to determine whether there is any danger . \nFishermen still were out working , however : They have been dropping miles of inflatable , oil-capturing boom around the region 's fragile wetlands and prime fishing areas . \nBad weather , however , was thwarting much of the work ; Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said 80 percent of the booms laid down off his state over the previous three days had broken down . \nHe said boom along other coasts is breaking down also . \nThe Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated to be at least 200,000 gallons a day . \nAt that rate , it would eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill -- which dumped 11 million gallons off the Alaska coast -- as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks . \n`` None of us have ever had experience at this level before . \nIt ai n't good , '' said Bob Love , coastal and nongame resources administrator with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . \n`` The longer it goes , the more fish and wildlife impacts there will be . '' \nEven if the oil stays mostly offshore , the consequences could be dire for sea turtles , dolphins and other deepwater marine life -- and microscopic plankton and tiny creatures that are a staple of larger animals ' diets . \nMoby Solangi , director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport , Miss. , said at least 20 dead sea turtles were found on the state 's beaches . \nHe said it 's too soon to say whether oil contamination killed them but that it is unusual to have them turning up across such a wide stretch of coast , spanning nearly 30 miles . \nNone of the turtles have oil on them , but Solangi said they could have ingested oily fish or breathed in oil on the surface . \nNecropsies will be performed Monday . \nThe situation could become even more grave if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and flows to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially whips around the state 's southern tip and up the Eastern Seaboard . \nTourist-magnet beaches and countless wildlife could be ruined . \nObama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . \nOn Sunday he called the spill a `` massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' and made clear that he was not accepting blame . \n`` BP is responsible for this leak . \nBP will be paying the bill , '' he said , rain dripping from his face in Venice , a Gulf Coast community serving as a staging area for the response . \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said any comparison between the ruptured BP oil well and Katrina was `` a total mischaracterization '' and that the government has taken an `` all hands on deck '' approach . \nPlaquemines Parish president Billy Nungesser met with Obama Sunday in Venice and said the president 's `` let 's - get-it-done approach was overwhelming . '' \nHe said he hopes that the president pressures BP to approve funding for a plan to have fishermen start laying oil-sopping booms very soon . \nObama acknowledged the booms have n't been working well out in the choppy gulf , Nungesser said . \nAfter the oil rig explosion , which killed 11 people , the flow of oil should have been stopped by a blowout preventer , but the mechanism failed , as have continuing efforts to activate it . \n`` As you can imagine , this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet , with -- in the dark , with robot-controlled submarines , '' BP PLC Chairman Lamar McKay said on ABC 's `` This Week . '' \nHe defended his company 's safety record . \nCharlie Holt , drilling and completing operations manager for BP in the Gulf of Mexico , said Sunday it 's still unclear why the blowout preventer failed . \nBut he suggested something could be in the way , or it could be damaged . \n`` There is nothing unique about the situation that should have prohibited the BOP from working as designed , '' Holt said of the device . \nThe containment boxes being built to stop the leak -- 40 feet tall , 24 feet wide and 14 feet deep -- were not part of the company 's original response plan . \nBut they appear to be the best hope for keeping the oil well from gushing for months . \nThe approach has been used previously only for spills in relatively shallow water . \nCoast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said engineers are still examining whether the valves and other systems that feed oil to a ship on the surface can withstand the extra pressures of the deep . \n`` This is a completely new way of dealing with this problem , '' said Greg Pollock , commissioner of the oil spill prevention and response program at the Texas General Land Office . \n`` Generally speaking , nobody 's ever tried anything like this on this scale . '' \nIf the boxes do n't work , BP also has begun work on its only other backup plan : two relief wells that will take as long as three months to drill . \nBob Fryar , senior vice president for BP in Angola , said the Bureau of Minerals Management has approved a plan to drill the wells . \nBP wants to drill two in case one does n't work . \nHe said teams are working 24 hours a day on every possible solution . \nHe said 389 people reported to an emergency center at BP 's Houston office alone . \n`` What BP 's doing is is throwing absolutely everything we can at this , '' he said Sunday . \n`` We ceratainly want to do everything we can , everything we can possibly think of , as a company , as an industry . '' \nBP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed the Deepwater Horizon rig was tapping when it exploded . \nA company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels . \nFryar said any numbers being thrown out are just estimates at best . \nThe rig was operated by BP and owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nTeams working to contain the spill have had limited success using airplanes to drop chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil , and rough seas have prevented ships from skimming crude from the surface . \nIn Alabama , National Guard soldiers arrived on the state 's Dauphin Island to build a berm meant to buffer part of the island against the slick . \nMassive Oil Spill Washes Ashore in the Gulf One Year Later , Images of Gulf Oil Spill From Space Still Powerful Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com . \n"}

Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the oil spill , said they will start taking pressure readings to validate the flow rate estimates . \nThe effort to drill two relief wells more than 3 miles below the surface to end the oil spill has exposed problems and questions the regulation and safety of the process . \nThat includes the fact that BP took more than 12 days to begin the well because the government did not require the company to have a relief well plan in place ahead of time . \nBP says the relief well has been a success and ahead of schedule , though the gaps in the relief well process mirror other regulatory issues and oversights that have been exposed since the rig exploded . \nBeaches in Orange Beach , Ala. , where large amounts of crude and tar balls washed ashore on Saturday , were mostly clean after crews worked through the night and in the early morning clearing the oil . \nClear plastic bags sat in piles , full of sand and tar balls , and some empty stretches of beach were still littered with grapefruit sized tar patties . \nWinds continued to blow two patchy , orange oil plumes from the spill toward the white sands of the western Florida Panhandle as skimmers worked to collect the crude before it came ashore . \nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection said one of the slicks is as close as 3 miles south of Pensacola Pass , an inlet next to a stretch of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and the tourist hotels of Pensacola Beach . \n"}

James Watson told the company that `` every effort must be expended to speed up '' the rate of containment . \n`` After being directed by the administration to move more quickly , BP is now stepping up its efforts to contain the leaking oil , '' an administration official said Monday , adding that the new plan has enough backup in place to account for bad weather and `` unforeseen circumstances . '' \n`` This administration has continuously demanded strategies and responses from BP that fit the realities of this catastrophic event , for which BP is responsible . \nWe will continue to hold BP accountable and bring every possible resource and innovation to bear , '' the official said . \nBP , in its letter , said it would mobilize a vessel from South America to store oil , in addition to two more lightering tankers -- used to transfer cargo between ships -- from Europe and other equipment . \nBP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said in the letter that the company believes `` this plan is responsive to your order , '' but cautioned that the firm was outside its comfort zone . \n`` The risks of operating multiple facilities in close proximity must be carefully managed , '' he wrote . \n`` Several hundred people are working in a confined space with live hydrocarbons on up to 4 vessels . \nThis is significantly beyond both BP and industry practice . \n`` We will continue to aggressively drive schedule to minimize pollution , but we must not allow this drive to compromise our number one priority , that being the health and safety of our people , '' he wrote . \nBP is facing increasing political and public pressure not only to speed up the rate of containment but to pledge more money to help those suffering economic losses from the spill . \nObama is pressing the company to set up an escrow account to pay for lost income to local businesses , a plan he will describe during an address to the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday . \nLeading up to his address , the president will tour Mississippi , Alabama and Florida to survey the damage . \nHe is set to arrive in Biloxi , Miss. , shortly before noon on Monday . \nTo this point , the president had only visited the Louisiana coast . \nFlorida Republican Sen.

{"id": "1409", "time": "2010-09-08", "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- BP took some of the blame for the Gulf oil disaster in an internal report issued Wednesday , acknowledging among other things that it misinterpreted a key pressure test of the well . \nBut in a possible preview of its legal strategy , it also pointed the finger at its partners on the doomed rig . \nThe highly technical , 193-page report attributes the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history and the rig explosion that set it off to a complex chain of failures both human and mechanical . \nSome of those problems have been made public over the past 4 ? \nmonths , such as the failure of the blowout preventer to clamp the well shut . \nThe report is far from the definitive ruling on the cause of the catastrophe . \nFor one thing , government investigators have not yet begun to fully analyze the blowout preventer , which was raised from the bottom of the sea over Labor Day weekend . \nBut it provides an early look at the company 's probable legal strategy -- spreading the blame among itself , rig owner Transocean , and cement contractor Halliburton -- as it deals with hundreds of lawsuits , billions of dollars in claims and possible criminal charges in the coming months and years . \nCritics of BP called the report self-serving . \n`` This report is not BP 's mea culpa , '' said Rep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . \n, a member of a congressional panel investigating the spill . \n`` Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one . \nBP is happy to slice up blame as long as they get the smallest piece . '' \nThe report 's conclusions stand in contrast to a widely seen BP ad campaign in which the company casts no blame for the explosion and vows to clean up and restore the Gulf Coast . \n`` BP blaming others for the Gulf oil disaster is like Bernie Madoff blaming his accountant , '' said Robert Gordon , an attorney for fishermen , hotels and restaurants affected by the spill . \nAnother plaintiff 's lawyer , W. Mark Lanier , scoffed : `` This is like the ringleader of a lynch mob saying , ` Well , I did n't bring the rope ; he did . ' '' \nThe disaster began when the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nBP 's well spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf before a temporary cap stopped it in mid-July . \nMembers of Congress , industry experts and workers who survived the blast have accused BP 's engineers of cutting corners to save time and money on a project that was 43 days and more than $ 20 million behind schedule at the time of the blast . \nNearly 24 hours before the explosion , Halliburton was using cement to seal the gap between the well casing and the hole drilled in the seafloor . \nIt was also cementing the bottom of the well shut until the day BP was ready to begin extracting oil and gas from it . \nIn its report , BP said that it was a bad cementing job that contributed to the blowout and that the design of the well was probably not to blame . \nIt also said `` more thorough review and testing by Halliburton '' and `` stronger quality assurance '' by BP 's well team might have identified weaknesses in the plan for cementing . \nThe report acknowledged , as investigators have previously suggested , that BP 's engineers and employees of Transocean misinterpreted a pressure test of the well 's integrity before the explosion . \n`` The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established , '' the investigators said . \nThey also blamed employees on the rig from both companies for failing to respond to other warning signs that the well was in danger of blowing out . \nThe words `` blame '' and `` mistake '' never appear in the report . \n`` Fault '' shows up 20 times , but only once in the same sentence as the company 's name . \n`` The team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident , '' the investigators said . \n`` Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident . \nMultiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' \nMark Bly , who as BP 's safety chief led the internal investigation , said the report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company 's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame . \nThe six-person investigating panel had access to only a few workers from other companies , and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released to BP . \nTransocean blasted the report as a self-serving attempt to conceal what it called the real cause of the explosion -- `` BP 's fatally flawed well design . '' \nHalliburton said it found a number of omissions and inaccuracies in the report and is confident the work it completed on the well met BP 's specifications . \n`` Contractors do not specify well design or make decisions regarding testing procedures as that responsibility lies with the well owner , '' the company said . \nWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs noted `` there is an active investigation into what went wrong '' and said the administration 's job is to find out what happened and hold those responsible accountable . \nFederal prosecutors are among those investigating . \nIn Wednesday trading in New York , BP stock rose $ 1.18 , or 3.2 percent , to close at $ 38.37 . \nInvestigators know the explosion was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that shot up the drill column and ignited . \nBut they do n't know exactly how and why the gas escaped . \nAnd they do n't know for certain why the blowout preventer did n't work . \nBut in its report , BP said the blowout preventer did n't do its job because it was damaged in the explosion and because it had a bad valve and weak batteries . \nTransocean , which was responsible for maintaining the blowout preventer , has insisted the batteries were in working order . \n-- Its use of six centralizers during the cementing , instead of the 21 recommended by Halliburton , probably did not contribute to the cement 's failure . \nCentralizers make sure the casing is running down the center of the well bore . \nIf the casing is cemented off-center , there is a risk of an imperfect seal that could allow oil and gas to escape . \n-- Just before the blast , the flammable gas leaking from the well was directed onto the rig instead of being vented overboard . \nThe rig 's ventilation system may have allowed the gas to enter the engine rooms , where it may have ignited . \n-- Recommendations should be considered to improve offshore drilling practices . \nIt suggested , among other things , that standards for reporting and investigating incidents be clarified and strengthened . \nSeparately on Wednesday , the Obama administration said it sent a sixth bill , for $ 128.5 million , to BP and others for costs associated with the spill . \nThe first five bills , totaling $ 389.9 million , have been paid in full by BP , the government said . \n"}

'' \nBP PLC agreed to pay Kenneth Feinberg 's firm , Feinberg Rozen LLP , $ 850,000 a month starting in mid-June , according to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which has been set up to compensate fishermen , business owners , residents and other Gulf Coast victims of the April 20 well blowout that killed 11 rig workers and spewed more than 170 million gallons of oil into the sea . \nThe claims facility on Thursday told The Associated Press the bill for the firm 's services is now up to about $ 3.35 million , and Feinberg 's firm will continue to receive $ 850,000 a month from BP through the end of the year , after which the contract will be reviewed . \nClaims spokeswoman Amy Weiss declined comment on the payment details , referring AP to an Oct. 8 report from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , whose own firm , Debevoise & Plimpton LLP , was hired by Feinberg 's office to review the deal . \n`` The firm 's work on the -LRB- Gulf Coast Claims Facility -RRB- is largely unprecedented , '' Mukasey wrote in his report . \n`` The assignment is to allocate the largest claims fund in American history and to do so under both intense time pressure and public scrutiny . '' \nMukasey wrote that the fees being charged to BP by Feinberg 's firm are warranted given the enormous task . \n`` The engagement commands a substantial commitment of the firm 's personnel and resources , '' he wrote . \nAs of Nov. 3 , the claims fund had paid victims about $ 1.7 billion , though many across the coast are still awaiting checks or say they have been paid too little and are struggling to keep up with bills after a summer of lost revenue . \nThe facility has received about 337,000 claims for compensation . \nAbout 97,000 have been paid or approved for payment . \nAnother 97,000 claimants have filed requests for money but have provided no documentation to back up their losses , according to Feinberg . \nThe claims fund is denying many of those filings outright . \nTo date , about 32,000 claimants have been denied . \nVictims have until Nov. 23 to file for emergency payments to help keep them afloat . \nAfter that , they must submit a claim for a final settlement from BP . \nBy doing that , they must give up their right to ever sue BP . \nPresident Barack Obama tapped Feinberg , who previously oversaw money doled out to 9\\/11 victims , to run the BP claims fund , which the London-based company created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill . \nFeinberg is paid by BP , but he insists he is operating the fund independently and remains an advocate for Gulf Coast residents and is n't influenced at all by the oil giant in the process . \nThe claims facility said Thursday the firm 's fees are being paid directly by BP and are not coming from the compensation fund . \nThe program declined to say how much Feinberg is making personally , just that the fee is being paid to his firm . \nFeinberg took over the claims process from BP in August . \n"}
