' '' \nAllen said at a White House news conference . \nBP was `` exhausting every technical means possible '' to meet its legal responsibility to cap the well and contain the spreading oil , he said . \nThe company was on the defensive on Monday against the harsh criticism from the Obama administration . \n`` I do n't know of anything else we could do , but if the government felt there were other things to do it is clearly within their power to do that , '' BP Chief Operations Officer Doug Suttles told reporters . \nThe oil spill is a political hot potato for the Obama administration ahead of a November election that is widely expected to erode Democrats ' control of the U.S. Congress . \nAnalysts warn that voters may punish Democrats regardless of who is ultimately deemed responsible for the mess . \nThe latest CNN\\/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 51 percent of Americans were unhappy with Obama 's handling of the spill that was sparked by an explosion on April 20 . \nThe poll was based on telephone interviews with just over 1,000 people between May 21-23 . \nThe White House has repeatedly said it is the British energy giant 's responsibility to clean up the spill , but with public anger over BP 's handling of the crisis intensifying , there have been calls for the Obama administration to take charge . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , who has been critical of the federal government 's response , again called for more equipment , especially booms , to help stop the oil from making landfall . \nHe said 70 miles of his state 's coastline had been affected by the oil spill . \nLouisiana 's marshes are nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make the state the top commercial seafood producer in the continental United States . \nFishing is now banned in a large swath of the Gulf because of the spill . \nDuring a tour of affected areas of the Gulf coast , Salazar assured residents the government would hold BP accountable for the economic hardship the spill had imposed on them . \n`` We will keep our boot on their neck until the job gets done , '' Salazar told reporters . \n`` This is a BP mess , it is a horrible mess and it is a massive environmental mess . '' \nSalazar said an ongoing investigation by U.S. authorities would hold the company accountable `` both civilly and in whatever way is necessary , '' appearing to leave open the possibility of a criminal inquiry . \nAsked about the possibility of a criminal investigation , BP CEO Tony Hayward said : `` There will be all sorts of investigations following this . \nRightly , and we will deal with them as they come . '' \n`` TOP KILL '' PLANNED FOR WEDNESDAY A report on the disaster that will influence whether the Interior Department resumes issuing offshore drilling permits will be sent to Obama on Thursday , the White House said . \nBP said the spill , triggered by an explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon rig and killed 11 workers , had cost it $ 760 million so far . \nIt also pledged up to $ 500 million on Monday toward studying the impact of the spill . \nIn its latest attempt to plug the leak , BP plans to inject heavy fluids and then cement into the seabed well to block oil flow in a so-called `` top kill '' operation on Wednesday . \nBP executives have warned there is `` no certainty '' that the containment efforts will be successful , because they have never been attempted at the depths -- a mile down -- where the well is located . \nThe company has estimated that about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have been leaking every day , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 70,000 and even 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . \nSuttles said if the `` top kill '' operation did not work , the company would attempt to put a `` top hat '' containment device over the larger leak to try to capture most of the oil and pipe it up to a tanker on the surface . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nSo they keep it leaking to justify drilling relief wells because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . \nThey are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . \nBP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . \nBp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . \nIf the mud does not work then they will put a new Blow out preventer over the old one -LRB- let me guess they don t have the new one sitting on the bottom next to the well to try 10 minutes after the mud fails -RRB- If BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells . \nIT S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY . \nBelieve me BP DID THE MATH FAIL CLOSED VALVES must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . \nIn many cases valves are fail close for safety . \nFail closed simply means that they are designed so that they need to be activated to remain open , or in the absence of a signal to an activator forcing them open they close . \nFAIL CLOSED VALVES are mandated in many situations for safety and fire prevention . \nFAIL CLOSED VALVES must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . \nThe industry will lobby agents FAIL CLOSED VALVES -LRB- there excuses will be lies -RRB- so we the people must be diligent in demanding it , without loop holes . \nPlease copy this and post it every where you can . \nThe government , our President , were absent for far too long in doing anything about the oil spill . \nThe accident , yes it was an accident , was and is a disaster that must not be repeated and one that BP must continue to address . \nI have seen and heard more concern from BP than I have our President . \nThe government has a big role to play in clean up , control and coordination but all I have really heard from the President is blame and shame . \nThe shame is in the way the President has not stepped up when it comes to protecting our borders in AZ or the water ways of the gulf . \nHe is so busy siding with countries other than our own that he has forgotten , if he ever really knew , that his first job is not the forever campaigning but actually protecting our country . \nHis job is not to plunge us into the mire of debt but to help companies and businesses to find ways to hire the unemployed ... to create jobs not tax us to death . \nThe water ways of the gulf employee thousands of people but I did not see the kind of action from our President that would indicate he really cared . \nHis words ring hollow to the ears of many , we are tired of his words and we are tired of the hopeless policies he has placed on our country , our waterways and our borders . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "1349", "time": "2010-05-24", "text": "MEXICO CITY | Mon May 24 , 2010 4:56 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's race to cap its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is eerily similar to a 1979 accident off the coast of Mexico that caused the world 's worst oil spill . \nIn both cases natural gas flowed unnoticed into the well being drilled , causing an explosion . \nIn both cases a critical piece of fail-safe equipment -- the blowout preventer -- failed . \nAnd in both cases the operators struggled to quickly staunch the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP 's shares have been battered in the month since its Macondo well blew up , threatening tourism , fishing and wildlife along the Gulf Coast and landing the British oil giant with a multibillion dollar clean-up tab . \nBut while Mexico 's Ixtoc well was only 150 feet below the sea surface , Macondo lies at the crushing depth of 5,000 feet , forcing the company to use robots to do all undersea work . \nBut it would still not surpass the extent of the disaster caused by the Ixtoc spill , which belched crude oil for 297 days , dumping nearly 3 million barrels -LRB- 126 million gallons\\/477 million liters -RRB- of oil into the southern Gulf of Mexico , some of which eventually washed up on the Texas coast , according to Pemex . \nAnd the experience of Mexico 's state oil company Pemex shows that relief wells are no silver bullet . \nIxtoc , off the coast of the southeastern Mexican state of Campeche , continued to leak oil more than three months after Pemex completed its first relief well . \nPemex never revealed the exact cause of the accident and as recently as 2007 , Jan Erik Vinnem , an offshore risk management specialist at Norway 's University of Stavanger , wrote that the lessons learned from the disaster were `` unknown . '' \nPemex pumped cement and salt water into Ixtoc for months before finally bringing the runaway well under control and sealing it with cement plugs . \nPemex 's scramble to come up with other solutions while the relief wells were being drilled will sound familiar to those who have followed BP 's efforts to stop the oil gushing out of its ruptured well . \nDivers tried to manually operate the blowout preventer but this effort was unsuccessful and over the next several months Pemex tried a variety of solutions , including a plan to force metal spheres into the well to cut the flow of oil and lowering a steel structure over the spill to capture the crude . \nBP is trying similar schemes but the huge water depth it is operating at is vastly complicating its efforts . \nThe robots used by BP have been unable to get the blowout preventer to work and BP abandoned an attempt to cap its well with a steel structure after natural gas hydrates accumulated within the structure . \nExecutives even mulled shooting golf balls , pieces of tires and other debris into the well to try and stop the flow . \nThe company now plans to attempt a `` top kill '' procedure this week in an effort to stop the flow of oil by forcing heavy drilling fluids into the well , but BP only gives the procedure a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . \nBP says the spill has already cost it $ 760 million and it has promised to pay all legitimate claims for compensation , which will likely carry the cost to billions of dollars . \nPemex spent over $ 100 million on the capping and cleanup operations , but dodged most compensation claims by asserting sovereign immunity against U.S. courts . \n-LRB- Reporting by Robert Campbell , Editing by Sandra Maler -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWith the way things are going , it appears that relief wells drilled into the bore of the blown out well for the purpose of pumping cement into the well and killing it is the only method that will work . \nAnd , that is going to take time because of the water depth where all this is taking place . \nI 'd like to hear something from the `` drill , baby , drill '' crowd , but they 're as quite as a mouse . \nOf course , every now and then we do hear something from them like Sen. Murkowsky 's proposal to relieve BP of all liability for this disaster . \nThis disaster may be just what 's needed to wake up the American people as they otherwise do n't care what goes on around them as long as they have their creature comforts to insulate them from a hard world . \nMaybe , just maybe , they 'll start listening , when people who do know what they 're talking about warn of the grave risks associated with certain activities . \nThe reason the Demoncrats have done NOTHING but allowed the oil spill to spread and spread unabated and BP is using dispersants to cause the oil to spread over the surface of the ocean as much as possible , is because they HOPE that the dark oil on the surface of the water will cause the ocean to absorb MUCH MORE heat from the sun then normal and CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING TO BECOME TRUTH ! \nAs we understand it , Governor Schwarzenegger of California has now turned against offshore oil drilling -LRB- because of the BP wellhead blowout and spill of 2010 -RRB- . \nThat 's a smart political move . \nOne must wonder why President Obama , Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid have not also collectively made the same political move ... especially in an election year for the democrat party in congress . \nBy the time Mexico 's Pemex spill of 1979 was brought under control in 1980 , another election year was in progress , i.e. , -LRB- then ex-California -RRB- Governor Reagan v. President Carter . \nWe have been reviewing the Prudhoe Bay Alaska oil spill of just 4 years ago ... attributable to BP 's maintenance policies and procedures . \nThat spill only cost BP a `` trivial '' $ 40 million in fines , etc. , however . \nWe have n't seen B-ritish P-etroleum 's green , environmentally friendly advertising campaign lately , i.e. , `` B-eyond P-etroleum '' . \nPerhaps BP will rename it `` Beyond the Gulf '' . \nMay 24 , 2010 6:19 pm EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe size of BP 's disaster in the Gulf could eclipse the scale of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska 's Prince William Sound , in which an estimated 250,000 sea birds perished . \nDIVING BIRDS HARDEST HIT SO FAR The birds hardest hit by oil in the Gulf so far are those that feed by diving into the water for fish , including the Louisiana state bird , the brown pelican , removed last year from the U.S. endangered species list , and the northern gannet , Holcomb said . \nBut shorebirds , wading birds and songbirds will increasingly be put in harm 's way as more oil washes onto beaches and into marshlands . \nOil impairs the insulating properties of birds ' feathers , exposing them to cold and making it difficult for them to float , swim and fly . \nChemicals in the petroleum also can burn their skin and irritate their eyes . \nThey also end up ingesting the oil when they preen , damaging their digestive tracts . \nOther wildlife at immediate risk in the Gulf are sea turtles and marine mammals . \nTo date , 209 sea turtles have been found dead or debilitated along the Gulf Coast , about double the number reported late last week , a tally that wildlife officials said then could be considered normal for this time of year . \nThe latest figure includes 194 that washed ashore dead and 12 that were found stranded alive , two of which later died in rehab , said Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian and professor at the University of California at Davis who is overseeing sea turtle and marine mammal rescue teams in Louisiana . \nThree remaining turtles in the latest tally were found heavily oiled at sea but have survived , he said . \nThose three are the only ones with outward signs of oil contamination . \nNecropsies , the animal equivalent of autopsies , have been performed on 40 turtle carcasses found intact , and a majority of the findings pointed to drowning or the aspiration of bottom sediments as the cause of death , Ziccardi said . \nAlthough the results are `` inconsistent with oil exposure as a primary cause of death , '' lab tests of tissue samples are still pending , so less visible factors remain to be determined , he said . \nNineteen dolphin deaths also have been confirmed since the spill began , but none of those animals showed any obvious external or internal signs of oiling , Ziccardi said . \n-LRB- Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Sandra Maler -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "963", "time": "2010-06-03", "text": "VENICE , Louisiana | Thu Jun 3 , 2010 7:47 pm EDT VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP cleared the way on Thursday for an attempt to cap the runaway oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and funnel escaping crude to the surface in a high-stakes bid to slow the 45-day-old undersea gusher . \nThe energy giant 's robot submarines sheared off the pipe rising above the crippled wellhead assembly after more than two days of trying , setting the stage for an attempt to lower a containment apparatus over the oil-spewing pipe . \nDespite the initial success in its latest effort to curb the flowing crude , BP 's financial outlook was further clouded as two credit-rating agencies downgraded the company 's debt , reflecting assessments that BP faces lasting damage . \nHours later , the Obama administration said it had sent a preliminary bill for $ 69 million to BP and `` other responsible parties '' to cover oil spill costs . \nThe U.S. disaster response chief , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , said BP would begin trying later on Thursday to position a containment cap over the wellhead assembly to start bringing at least some of the escaping oil and gas to the surface , where it would be collected on ships and safely removed . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward said the next 12 to 24 hours will determine whether the capping operation will succeed . \n`` It 's an important milestone , '' Hayward said in Houston , adding , `` This is simply the beginning . '' \nIt was the first glimmer of hope for BP after many futile attempts to contain an oil leak that is belching 19,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico . \nAllen called the day 's developments a `` significant step forward . '' \nBP does not expect to be able to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells are due for completion . \nPresident Barack Obama , seeking to contain political fallout from the disaster , planned to visit the Louisiana Gulf coast again on Friday to view what has eclipsed the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nObama told CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' to be broadcast on Thursday night that he is `` furious at this entire situation '' in the Gulf because `` somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions . '' \nObama said he has not seen enough of a rapid response from BP . \nThe U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research projected that the oil slick would be driven by wind and currents around the Florida peninsula by early summer and up the East Coast , possibly as far as North Carolina . \nThe Coast Guard said late on Thursday that oil spill investigators were responding to renewed reports of tar balls and other oily debris near several islands in the Florida Keys , which extend from the southern tip of the Florida peninsula . \nBut the substances will be tested to see if they originated from the Gulf spill . \nTar balls found in the Keys weeks ago were determined to be unrelated to the blowout . \nRatings agencies Moody 's and Fitch Ratings downgraded BP 's credit ratings on Thursday and said they might cut them further on rising concerns over clean-up and legal costs . \nFitch , which in May admitted it had been wrong to assume that the impact of the spill on BP 's finances would be eased by insurance , said clean-up costs could exceed its worst-case scenario of around $ 5 billion in any one year . \nShares in BP , which are traded in London and New York , had a roller-coaster day but eventually jumped in New York by 4 about percent . \nElsewhere in the sector , shares of Halliburton Co. were down about 0.4 percent and Cameron International dropped 0.7 percent in late trading . \nTwo U.S. lawmakers have called on BP to suspend shareholder dividends until the full costs of the oil spill cleanup are calculated . \nLondon-based investment bank Evolution Securities said in a research note : `` We believe BP will bow to political pressure in the U.S. and suspend dividend payments for the remainder of 2010 . '' \nHayward , seeking to reassure the rattled residents of the Gulf coast , vowed BP would work to sop up the mess and would stay `` until every drop of oil has been recovered '' and will `` meet our obligations to our stakeholders . '' \nOil has been gushing nonstop into the Gulf since April 20 , when a Transocean Ltd drilling rig licensed to BP exploded , killing 11 workers . \nThe resulting spill has threatened to wreak havoc on the fragile ecology and economies of the Gulf Coast states while confronting the Obama administration with a key test of its ability to handle a complex and evolving crisis . \nIn another development , the U.S. Minerals Management Service said it would no longer approving drilling permits for shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico , effectively extending a federal drilling ban the White House had said last week would end soon . \nObama , whose reputation is on the line over the spill , scheduled his third visit to the Gulf on Friday . \nHis spokesman , Robert Gibbs , dismissed suggestions by some pundits that the president should drop his calm demeanor and show more emotion . \n`` Pounding on a podium is not going to fix a hole in the ocean , '' Gibbs said . \nWashington Post columnist David Broder wrote on Thursday that Obama `` will have to hope he does n't end up as Jimmy Carter , '' the U.S. president who lost his 1980 reelection bid after failing to secure the release of hostages held in Iran for 444 days . \nGovernment forecasters said part of the far-flung oil sheen had crept to within 6 miles of Florida 's Gulf coast panhandle and was expected to reach the white , sandy shore there in days . \nEmergency planners kept a wary eye on two powerful currents in the Gulf , the loop ring that circles the bulk of the spill and the loop current that would carry oil south toward the Florida Keys and then up around the U.S. Eastern seaboard . \nThey were expected to converge in 48 to 72 hours . \n`` Once those connect , that 's it , '' state meteorologist Amy Godsey said . \nLouisiana is the state hardest hit so far by oil , though the spill has fouled beaches in Mississippi and Alabama . \nThousands of fishermen , shrimpers and other seafood workers have been idled for weeks by government-imposed fishing restrictions that cover 37 percent of U.S. federal waters in the Gulf . \nBP could face billions of dollars in fines and penalties if a Justice Department investigation finds wrongdoing , in addition to billions from the economic liability and damages , according to legal experts . \nIt may also find it more difficult to meet targets for expanded production in the future , analysts said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe Russian 's used an explosive device to seal a well in the Arctic when it blew up . \nOur government needs to be able to step in and close a disaster like this down immediately . \nI believe that high risk explorations like this need to have severe consequences when an accident happens . \nWe need to let BP do their job . \nWe are not playing tiddlywinks here and are creating knowledge as we go . \nThis accident was just that , an accident -- an unforeseen event or resulting state that requires immediate action inorder to protect life , property and the environment . \nThe US Government needs to commit any and all resources except the legal machines to help BP . \nThe placing of blame and tough guy approach is counter-productive . \nWe are all in this together -- placing blame and threating does no good and just increase ire . \nPresident Obama the crude oil is toxic , and anyone who cleans the oily Gulf beaches needs to know the danger . \nDo n't allow the workers to become BP 's Collateral Damaged , like Exxon . \nArticle from Las Vegas Review Journal : The workers who are cleaning up the oil in the Gulf need to be aware of the chemicals that will be used . \nI am one of the 11,000 + cleanup workers from the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- , who is suffering from health issues from that toxic cleanup , without compensation from Exxon . \nMy name is Merle Savage ; a female general foreman during the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- beach cleanup in 1989 , which turned into 21 years of extensive health deterioration for me , and many other workers . \nDr. Riki Ott visited me in 2007 to explain about the toxic spraying on the beaches . \nShe also informed me that Exxon 's medical records and the reports that surfaced in litigation by sick workers in 1994 , had been sealed from the public , making it impossible to hold Exxon responsible for their actions . \nExxon developed the toxic spraying ; OSHA , the Coast Guard , and the state of Alaska authorized the procedure ; VECO and other Exxon contractors implemented it . \nBeach crews breathed in crude oil that splashed off the rocks and into the air -- the toxic exposure turned into chronic breathing conditions and central nervous system problems , along with other massive health issues . \nSome of the illnesses include neurological impairment , chronic respiratory disease , leukemia , lymphoma , brain tumors , liver damage , and blood disease . \nMy web site is devoted to searching for EVOS cleanup workers who were exposed to the toxic spraying , and are suffering from the same illnesses that I have . \nOur summer employment turned into a death sentence for many -- and a life of unending medical conditions for the rest of us Exxon s Collateral Damaged . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nHis comments came a day after he participated in a meeting at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency headquarters in Washington to `` brainstorm '' solutions to the oil spill . \nCameron said he has offered to help the government and BP in dealing with the spill . \nHe said he was `` graciously '' turned away by the British energy giant . \nHe said he has not spoken with the White House about his offer , and said that the outside experts who took part in the EPA meeting were now `` writing it all up and putting in reports to the various agencies . '' \nThe film director has helped develop deep-sea submersible equipment and other underwater ocean technology for the making of documentaries exploring the wrecks of the ocean liner Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck some two miles below the surface . \nCameron suggested the U.S. government needed to take a more active role in monitoring the undersea gusher , which has become the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \n`` I know really , really , really smart people that work typically at depths much greater than what that well is at , '' Cameron said . \nThe BP oil spill off the U.S. Gulf Coast is located a mile below the surface . \nWhile acknowledging that his contacts in the deep-sea industry do not drill for oil , Cameron said that they are accustomed to operating various underwater vehicles and electronic optical fiber systems . \n`` Most importantly , '' he added , `` they know the engineering that it requires to get something done at that depth . '' \nAmong the key issues that Cameron said he is interested in helping the government with are methods of monitoring the oil leak and investigating it . \n`` The government really needs to have its own independent ability to go down there and image the site , survey the site and do its own investigation , '' he said . \n`` Because if you 're not monitoring it independently , you 're asking the perpetrator to give you the video of the crime scene , '' Cameron added . \nCameron made two documentaries about the wreck of the Titanic as well as the blockbuster 1997 movie `` Titanic '' using a small fleet of specially designed remotely operated underwater vehicles . \nHe said his qualifications are not based on his background as a movie director but on his years of involvement in the deep-sea industry . \n-LRB- Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic , with additional reporting by Jill Sergeant -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOf course , he 'll do anything he can to appease his trial court lawyer buddies . \nMaybe that 's why the first thing he tried to do on this matter was raise the liability to 10 billion dollars which accomplishes absolutely nothing with respect to stopping or stemming the flow of oil into the Gulf or even cleaning it up for that matter . \nObama , you have betrayed your base on this matter . \nThis thing appalls me as it should anyone else with at least a semblance of decency . \nListen to what Cameron said . \nHe offered to help through both bp and the Obama admin . \nHe got turned down by bp . \nThe fact that Obama is allowing himself to be pulled around like a dog on a leash -LRB- by bp of all people -RRB- ought to appall anyone out there . \nBP should have been `` pushed aside '' on this matter long ago and the feds are obligated to take it over . \nI 'm not trying to villanize BP over this matter . \nIt would be way premature -LRB- and most likely counter - productive -RRB- to publicly show such sentiment . \nYou say criminal charges Holder ? \nJesus says , `` He that is without sin amongst you let him cast the first stone . '' \nIf BP is criminally culpable in this , you 'd better believe there are people in the government 's regulatory bodies that are at least equally criminally culpable if not more so . \nSo , got get ` em Obama\\/Holder . \nThey say this is Obama 's Katrina . \nI say it is worse than Katrina . \nIt is even worse than Bush senior 's sickening response to the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nGood riddance to you Obama\\/Holder in 2012 . \nThis gets to be silly fast . \nWhat exactly is the problem that Cameron is offering to solve ? \nThat is not a problem in this case , they have all sorts of observations . \nThey have that too . \nlack of skill does not appear to be the problem . \nIs BP the problem ? \nThey are focusing on trying to stop the spill , hard enough to do without the threats of jail time . \nOne wonders if somebody will suggest capital punishment for such disasters . \nThis is the way the Mafia operates , make a mistake and you end up in a dumpster . \nJames1976 wrote : `` Jesus says , He that is without sin amongst you let him cast the first stone . '' \nIf Cameron really knows all these really smart people . . \nthen forget waiting for BP to give permission . . \nThis should have a higher priory then waiting for permission . \nFix the problem , then worry about the possible repercussions . \nHuman repercussions that would be NOTHING compared to the death and destruction that 's been created now in nature . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1076", "time": "2010-06-03", "text": "LONDON | Thu Jun 3 , 2010 4:42 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fitch Ratings downgraded BP -LRB- BP . \nL -RRB- , reversing its view that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill would have a limited financial impact on the company , and was joined by Moody 's as fears grow over clean-up and legal costs . \n`` The downgrade of BP 's ratings reflects Fitch 's opinion that risks to both BP 's business and financial profile continue to increase following the Deepwater Horizon accident , '' Fitch said on Thursday . \nThe BP oil spill , which began in April , is causing an ecological and economic catastrophe along the U.S. Gulf coast . \nEstimates for the total cost to BP range from $ 5.3 billion from Dutch bank ING to $ 37 billion from Credit Suisse . \nFitch in May admitted to a mistake when it assumed that the impact of the spill on BP 's finances would be mitigated by insurance . \nHowever , Fitch said at the time the impact of the spill on BP 's credit rating remained limited . \nBP insures its own operations in the United States , rather than using commercial insurers , which means it is responsible for funding the clean-up -LRB- ID : nN30179546 -RRB- -LRB- ID : nLDE6441W9 -RRB- But on Thursday the agency downgraded its rating on BP debt to AA from AA + and attached a negative outlook , citing substantial additional risks including clean-up and legal costs . \nOther factors that could lead to further downgrades include the oil well flow rate permanently increasing , the relief well being drilled by BP failing to completely arrest the oil flow and clean-up costs exceeding Fitch 's worst-case scenario of around $ 5 billion in any one year , the agency added . \nMoody 's also on Thursday cut the group 's ratings by one notch to Aa2 from Aa1 , also citing the clean-up and legal costs , and placed the group on review for further possible downgrades . \n`` Moody 's expects these costs to weigh significantly on BP 's free cash flow generating capacity and to constrain its ability to focus on other key areas of the company 's business in the near to intermediate term , '' it said . \nReuters reported on Tuesday that a $ 23 billion slide in BP 's market value and a surge in the cost of protecting its debt were due to fears oil could continue spewing into the sea for another two months at least and that BP 's latest bid to stem the flow could make matters worse . \nFive-year credit default swaps on BP were about 30 basis points tighter on Thursday at around 230 basis points , according to data from Markit . \nOn Wednesday , the cost of insuring BP 's debt via CDS had soared , with BP 's five-year CDS widening at one stage by 100 basis points to a record 270 basis points . \nThe other main rating agency , Standard & Poor 's , which on May 7 revised its outlook for BP to negative from stable , has said it is reviewing ratings on around 35 companies as a result of a temporary ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . \nShares in BP gained as much as 4.7 percent on Thursday as a call with analysts planned for Friday gave hope there would be an update on the company 's plans for its dividend which is seen to be threatened by the growing cost of the spill . \nTwo U.S. Senators said on Wednesday BP should cut its dividend until the full costs for the clean-up can be calculated . \nThe stock was up 2.6 percent at 440.8 pence by 1336 GMT , back in line with European peers . \nSXEP , and outperforming a 1.8 percent higher UK market . \n`` Maybe some people have decided that on a risk reward basis the value 's there , '' said UBS analyst Jon Rigby , who added that most people 's estimates of the cost of the spill is now `` hugely '' over-discounted in the stock . \n"}

UNLIKELY The collapse in its share price means BP could become a takeover target , Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at brokerage Arbuthnot said on Tuesday . \nHowever , most analysts do not expect this to happen . \nExxon Mobil -LRB- XOM . \nN -RRB- , Royal Dutch Shell -LRB- RDSa . \nL -RRB- and Chevron -LRB- CVX . \nN -RRB- are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . \nThe U.S. government blocked the takeover of Asia-focused U.S. oil company Unocal by China 's CNOOC for strategic reasons , so most analysts doubt it would allow BP -- the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico -- to be taken over by a state-backed oil company . \nAntitrust issues could arise over BP 's refineries if it were acquired by Exxon , Shell or Chevron , Alex Morris said . \nThis could force the sale of the refineries but in the current depressed refining environment that would be difficult . \nBP 's significant U.S. gas production assets could also cause regulatory problems for any of the above , Jason Kenney at ING said . \nHowever , the biggest barriers to an acquirer making a move are the unknown liabilities that arise from the spill . \n`` It would be hard to see one of the other supermajors taking on such an unknown liability , '' Raymond James 's Morris said . \nSimilarly , selling of BP piecemeal may not attract buyers because the individual parts would still be liable for the spill . \nWashington may also block any deal seen to strengthen anyone in the oil industry . \n`` The last thing that President -LRB- Barack -RRB- Obama needs today is `` bigger oil , '' ING 's Kenney said in a research note . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBut oil-auto companies have spent billions killing the real alternatives to oil-burning cars : solar power and plug-in Electric cars . \nWe drive them every day , and make more electric on our rooftop than we need to drive 2000 miles per month -LRB- two Toyota NiMH RAV4-EV -RRB- . \nWhat 's stopping others from doing so ? \nChevron-GM sued Toyota to kill use of NiMH Nickel batteries , the only proven battery that lasts longer than the life of the car ; and government opposes solar power , preferring to fund tax breaks and handouts to coal and nuke power scammers . \nNickel-Metal Hydride is the only proven EV -LRB- Electric Vehicle -RRB- battery ; after 100K or 200K miles NiMH can be remelted down into new batteries without new mining . \nInstead of `` research '' , we need to start making and improving plug-in cars right now , not waiting for the perfect that never comes . \nLowering cost is the name of the game . \nSolar power and plug-in cars is the only sustainable way to power individual autos . \nRunning an EV 1000 miles per month takes only 250 kilo-Watt-hours of electric , about $ 25 worth ; about what two old refrigerators cost and about a third of the average home usage . \nIt would take only a tenth of the average home roof -- 6 square yards -- to make 250 kWh per month , enough electric energy to run a plug-in car 1000 miles per month . \nBecause solar power and plug-in cars would cut oil profits , Big Oil has used its financial power to strangle and delay use of these obviously simple and working alternative to oil and coal . \nNo matter how many nuke or coal plants we build , it wo n't replace one drop of oil unless there are plug-in cars to use the electric ; but if we had plug-in cars , we would n't even need new power plants . \nThe money not spent on oil pays for solar . \nWe can make it happen . \nAmerica 's largest open-pit coal mine is a witches cauldron of toxic waste and caustic destruction ; but if the ground were left alone , and covered with solar panels , we 'd get more electric energy from the same space -LRB- 28,000 acres -RRB- than we get from the coal . \nInstead of risking death in criminal coal mines , or skirting safety rules on oil rigs , the same workers could be manufacturing and installing solar panels and building and recycling electric plug-in cars and reforming their batteries . \nElectric cars are all powered with American electrons ; no electric is imported . \nBuying oil from people who hate us gives them our money and leaves only air and ground pollution , asthma and smog after it 's burned . \nIf there were no alternative to oil-fired cars , the permanent lung damage caused by burning oil might be necessary ; but there IS an alternative , solar and plug-in cars . \nThere is no higher cost than killing your kids lungs - and the Earth - to enrich Big Oil . \nit could happen to any company , that is new to the industry ? \nThat will take years so the financial impact most likely will be divided on several years as for the valdez incident . \nIn the end , with probable stricter regulations on offshore drilling as well as the fallout effects on higher liability costs , of which these costs will be passed on to each one of us , will this be enough to either force more alternative energy use or just make US production uncompetitive against foreign oil , ie . \nfrom the middle east ? \nThe latter of which would be hypocritical , as the energy policy is to be more energy independent and keep US dollars at home to be put to good use in pumping up the nuclear industry that have probably backed so many key policy makers that would make everyone believe that nuclear power is clean and without risks vs. oil . \nCan anyone make sense of all this ???

UNLIKELY The collapse in its share price means BP could become a takeover target , Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at brokerage Arbuthnot said on Tuesday . \nHowever , most analysts do not expect this to happen . \nExxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . \nThe U.S. government blocked the takeover of Asia-focused U.S. oil company Unocal by China 's CNOOC for strategic reasons , so most analysts doubt it would allow BP -- the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico -- to be taken over by a state-backed oil company . \nAntitrust issues could arise over BP 's refineries if it were acquired by Exxon , Shell or Chevron , Alex Morris said . \nThis could force the sale of the refineries but in the current depressed refining environment that would be difficult . \nBP 's significant U.S. gas production assets could also cause regulatory problems for any of the above , Jason Kenney at ING said . \nHowever , the biggest barriers to an acquirer making a move are the unknown liabilities that arise from the spill . \n`` It would be hard to see one of the other supermajors taking on such an unknown liability , '' Raymond James 's Morris said . \nSimilarly , selling of BP piecemeal may not attract buyers because the individual parts would still be liable for the spill . \nWashington may also block any deal seen to strengthen anyone in the oil industry . \n`` The last thing that President -LRB- Barack -RRB- Obama needs today is `` bigger oil , '' ING 's Kenney said in a research note . \nCEO HAYWARD LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR THE MOMENT Inevitably , there have been questions over whether Hayward should stay . \nHe told the Daily Mail '' ... it would be ridiculous to resign at this point '' and most analysts have defended the CEO 's position . \nJohn Hofmeister , former president of Shell Oil Company , Shell 's U.S. unit , and author of `` Why We Hate the Oil Companies , '' told Reuters it was unreasonable to blame the CEO . \n`` Ultimately the CEO is accountable and responsible ... but the individual on the rig may have a made a bad judgment . '' \nInvestors had been happy with Hayward 's efforts as CEO . \nIn the almost three years before the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , he had improved refinery operations , boosted oil production and cut a lot of management overheads . \n`` People were happy with him -- he had done a good job turning around BP , '' Alex Morris said . \nSo far , investors and analysts seem to be backing Hayward . \nHowever , documents and testimony submitted to government investigations into the incident have prompted some in Washington and Louisiana to question BP 's decisions about the drilling of the oil well . \nHayward took up his role promising to standardize and streamline the way BP built facilities and drilled oil wells . \nIf the structures he put in place are deemed to have led to any decisions that contributed to the accident , then the CEO 's position could come under pressure . \nBP IS BARRED FROM DOING SOME BUSINESS IN THE U.S. . \nAT LEAST TEMPORARILY - SOMEWHAT LIKELY Some commentators have called for BP to be banned from drilling in the United States , which would seriously damage the company 's business given that 40 percent of its assets are in the United States and it depends on the country for its growth plans . \nAnalysts are divided on whether some debarment is likely . \n`` There are going to be heavy fines . \nThe regulator is going to be tough on them getting permits but all companies have to be treated by the rules . \nThis is n't Venezuela , '' said Morris . \nHowever , under federal law BP would have to be banned from government contracts for a period of time if convicted of a criminal offense under the Clean Water Act . \nThe company could also be barred from contracts if civil judgments are entered against it for violations of environmental laws . \nBP has already faced partial bans on receiving federal contracts because of past violations of U.S. laws . \nAfter the pipeline leaks at its Prudhoe Bay Unit in Alaska and a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery , the company was ineligible to receive federally funded contracts for services from those two facilities . \nThe company had been negotiating with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over those bans but those talks were halted after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nWhile BP could face such a penalty in the latest oil spill , one law professor and private practitioner , Anthony Sabino , noted that there were not a lot of other oil producers so it might only be a short-term debarment . \nThat could be viewed as a punitive and politically motivated action , but regardless such a ban would likely `` be a short-term hit and not substantial , '' he said . \nBP TO FACE FINES AND PENALTIES - LIKELY In addition to facing billions of dollars in costs from the economic liability and damages , BP could also potentially face billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties if the Justice Department 's investigation finds wrongdoing . \nSome legal experts have said that proving some criminal charges may be more difficult because it requires showing intent , negligence or other malfeasance . \nHowever , some environmental laws have simple criminal violations , including the one banning harm to migratory birds . \nFor each barrel of oil that prosecutors can prove has spilled into the Gulf , BP could be fined $ 1,100 or as much as $ 4,300 if they are able to prove negligence was the cause . \nProsecutors could use estimates from a team of scientists and experts who found between 12,000 barrels per day and 19,000 bpd are flowing from the broken well . \nThat could equal as much as $ 81.7 million in fines per day at the high end . \nWith 44 days of oil spewing from the well , that would equal $ 3.6 billion as of Wednesday . \nAdditionally , U.S. laws protect endangered species and migratory birds , with fines of up to $ 25,000 per violation . \nAlready more than 100 birds have been found oiled or dead , according to the Unified Area Command for the spill response efforts . \nThere are also criminal fines associated with such violations , which could be as much as $ 50,000 . \nIf other companies are also found to be responsible for the spill as well , the penalties could potentially be imposed on each violator . \nIn some cases , most significantly the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , companies try to negotiate a settlement with the federal government , as is expected with BP . \nTwo years after the Valdez spill , Exxon settled U.S. civil and criminal charges in a plea agreement that included just over $ 1 billion in penalties , damages and restitution . \nAt the time , the $ 125 million in criminal penalties was the largest of its kind while $ 900 million went to reimburse federal and state governments for responding to the spill and later restoration projects . \nThe federal government and state of Alaska in 2006 sought another $ 92 million from Exxon , however that request has not been resolved . \nBP TO FACE GROWTH HEADWINDS IN THE FUTURE - LIKELY BP 's targets for expanded production will become tougher to achieve following the oil spill , and its financial performance will suffer from higher costs -- even after spill costs and fines are paid . \nBP said earlier this year it was targeting oil and gas output growth of 1-2 percent over the medium term . \nThis plan relies heavily on BP 's U.S. projects and especially the Gulf of Mexico , where it was leading the push into ever-deeper waters . \nThe dislocation caused by dealing with the spill , including the diversion of vessels from other fields means BP will face a particular challenge in keeping its drilling plans on track . \nA moratorium imposed by Obama on new deepwater drilling after the spill will also slow development plans at BP and across the industry . \nEven when the oil spill has been dealt with and the drilling moratorium is lifted , BP 's damaged reputation is likely to mean more scrutiny from regulators than other companies , analysts said . \nThis means it will likely take longer than it would have expected in the past to bring fields to production . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico position was much heralded by management as a differentiated position for BP relative to its peers only 12 months ago ... the full monetization of these assets is likely to take longer , '' Morgan Stanley oil analyst Theepan Jothilingam said in a research note . \nLower-than-expected production would hit BP 's financial performance but in addition to this , higher costs could weigh on BP 's profits . \nAnalysts at Bernstein estimated the company could face 10 percent higher operating costs in the United States after the spill , in part due to the need to impose tougher safety standards . \n"}

'' \nThe oil will be analyzed to confirm the link with the oil spill , the worst in U.S. history . \nOf all the states affected so far , Florida has the most to lose . \nTourism is its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million people . \nInvestment analysts say that since Florida has no income tax and relies heavily on sales tax revenues , any fall-off in tourism could badly squeeze a state economy still bleeding from a housing market meltdown and the global recession . \nNelson told CNN the economic impact of the spill on Gulf Coast states including Florida was `` already billions -LRB- of dollars -RRB- ... and if it goes all summer and you put that much oil in the Gulf , it 's going to be multiple billions of dollars of economic loss and damage . '' \nHe added a flotilla of ships , including several Coast Guard cutters , were working 25 to 50 miles off northwest Florida , scooping up portions of oil . \n`` That 's the goal , to try to keep it away from the bays and estuaries and the beach .

'' \nBP has deployed a long suction tube down to the larger of two leaks from the well , but a BP spokesman said on Sunday this captured only 1,360 barrels per day of oil over the 24 hours to midnight Saturday . \nThe flow has been declining from the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day the company had said the tube was siphoning off three days ago . \nBP engineers are now preparing a `` top kill , '' pumping heavy fluids into the well to try to shut it off , an operation to begin late Tuesday or early Wednesday , Dudley told CNN . \nMany scientists believe the Gulf spill has already eclipsed the 11 million gallons -LRB- 41 million liters -RRB- spilled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident in Alaska . \nThey warn the spreading oil could be caught in a powerful ocean current that could take it to the Florida Keys , Cuba and the U.S. East Coast . \nCoast Guard Admiral Mary Landry said 65.6 miles of shoreline has been impacted so far and about 30 acres of marshland . \nShe told a briefing that of the area affected on the coast `` 25 miles ... are really readily cleanable and the others are a little harder access but we 'll get to it . '' \nOf the impacted marshland about half of it has heavily oiled she said the rest `` lightly oiled with sheen . '' \nChurchgoers in Louisiana coastal parishes affected by the spill prayed for God 's help . \n`` You -LRB- God -RRB- can clear that oil up , because that oil was down there thousands of years before it came up in the Gulf . \nSo you know what to do with it , dear God , '' retired oyster fisherman Herbert Guidry prayed in the New Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in Houma . \nAnalysts say growing ecological and economic damage from the spill could become a political liability for Obama before November congressional elections . \nWhile also promising to hold Washington accountable for proper oversight of the industry , Obama ramped up pressure on companies linked to the spill : BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . \nHe believed a `` breakdown of responsibility '' between them led to the disaster . \nBP stocks have taken a beating in the markets in the month since the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers and touched off the spill . \nIts share price shed another 4 percent on Friday in London , extending recent sharp losses . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nFail closed simply means that they are designed so that they need to be activated to remain open , or in the absence of a signal to an activator forcing them open they close . \nThis is mandated in many situations for safety and fire prevention . \nIt must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . \nThe industry will lobby to avoid this so we the people must be diligent in demanding it without loop holes . \nPlease copy this and post it every where you can Do the math , it s ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY at 70,000 barrels a day x $ 70 a barrel BP will make $ 766,500,000 a year . \nIf BP stops the leak they would not be allowed to complete the two relief wells . \nOnce their grouse negligence is brought out , they would never be allowed to drill that reservoir . \nSo they keep it leaking because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . \nThey are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . \nBP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . \nBp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . \nIf BP would have stopped the leak wks ago they never get the $ 10,000,000,000 . \nIf BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells . \nIT S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY . \nBelieve me BP DID THE MATH ! \nLets hope that the oil company executives got paid out with sufficiently large bonuses , earned by cutting corners , so as not to be unduly inconvenienced for this science fiction scale catastrophe . \nPerhaps this will get rid of those pesky fisherman , nature lovers , and tourists , who just get in the way . \nSeriously , if they did care about anyone else they would have had a plan in place . \nThe fact is , executives are already paid out , and have no stake in what happens next to their large corporations or banks . \nAn act of unspeakable violence has been done . \nThe people have to take back their own country , and lest this become our French revolution moment , what we really need to pray for is PEACEFUL change , because any non peaceful change will sow the seeds of its own illegitimacy , and only replace one problem with another . \nThe ruling class succeeds because they are more organized than the ruled . \nWe must not allow ourselves to be divided arguing wither the earth is flat . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1078", "time": "2010-09-20", "text": "Illustrating a news story with photographs can be much more challenging than simply deploying a talented photographer on site . \nSometimes initially identifying where and how the best pictures will be made is a daunting task , let alone getting a photographer there , especially when the subject is spread over thousands of square miles of sea and ground zero is miles offshore and a mile below the surface . \nNo news event in recent memory has been more challenging to cover than the Gulf Coast oil spill due to the nature and dynamics of the story . \nWhen it was first determined that the BP well was gushing oil , our coverage efforts for the next several months were focused on oil seen on the surface , oil reaching the hundreds of miles of shoreline , impact on local fishermen and residents and wildlife and clean up efforts . \nWhile several talented Reuters photographers documented these aspects of the story , my co-workers and I on the Washington picture desk , with help from our colleagues in Singapore , went 5,000 feet below the surface to illustrate the actual leak and containment , all from the comfort of our desk chair . \nBy capturing still images from live video feeds of the seabed operations provided by BP . \nPressured by Congress , on May 21 , a month after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught on fire ; BP began showing on their website live video feeds of oil gushing from a riser on the seabed floor . \nDuring the following 4 months while efforts to contain and kill the well were underway , live video feeds could be viewed from up to 16 remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- , tethered to and managed by up to 8 surface boats . \nThe ROVs carried out all the tasks necessary for containment , giving the viewer of the live feed a front row seat to perhaps one of the largest engineering undertakings ever performed at such depths . \nAs the story as a whole involved so many angles , some of the key turning points to illustrate centered on the progress seen only from the video feeds , from the first view of the leak at the source , to the capping of the well and the first time no oil could be seen gushing from the mechanism . \nCovering the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster as a still photographer for Reuters has brought unique challenges . \nAlthough the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico is huge , relatively small patches of oil have landed along coastal Louisiana . \nIt 's like a monster who hides most of the time and lashes out quickly , withholding its full strength . \nBut it has been important to show that oil is in fact having an ecological impact here , and to find areas with visible proof . \nOn Thursday May 20 , I accompanied a Reuters TV crew , correspondent Mathew Bigg and Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation on a boat , looking for heavy concentrations of oil in an area at the very southern tip of Louisiana . \nWe headed for an area which had just begun being inundated with oil from the Deepwater Horizon leak . \nAfter hours of searching , a broken propeller , and an unexpected lunch aboard a work barge , we had found the spot . \nAs Wood prepared to take a sample of the water to check its toxicity , I suited up in chest waders and slowly got into the murky water , one camera and lens stuffed into my waiters . \nManeuvering in the soft lagoon floor was tricky ; I sank down as I tried to walk and was concerned I might loose my balance and get myself and camera wet . \nSo I held onto the drifting boat long enough to get into position , cautiously letting go so I could have both hands free to shoot . \nWood leaned over to get samples and I was able to shoot it from from the perspective of the oily water . \nIt was shortly after midnight on March 24 , 1989 that the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef in Prince Edward Sound and began leaking millions of gallons of North Slope crude oil . \nI was sound asleep in Toronto , Canada when that happened . \nReuters was still taking a feed of pictures from UPI -LRB- United Press International -RRB- from the United States . \nBut I remember hearing the news that morning and packing my gear -LRB- which at that time was film , powder chemicals , portable darkroom , 16S color transmitter and of course . . \nsome cold weather clothing -RRB- . \nI sat in Toronto as the politics of the news business played out in Washington between Reuters and UPI . \nFinally , it was decided that we would both cover the story . \nSo , David Ake , a UPI staffer from Denver , and I made our way there . \nI remember landing in Anchorage , Alaska , and hauling my gear into a rental car at midnight , then driving six hours to Valdez in the dead of night . \nAbout 4 hours into the drive I was held up by a few hundred caribou , who decided to cross the two lane highway , they were just mingling so I still have vivid memories of being in the middle of nowhere honking my horn to help speed up the process . \nI rolled into Valdez at first light and it didn t take long to realize that most of the town s people did not want the media there . \nThe few media that had found rooms at the only hotel in town were all having to checkout as rumor had it that Exxon had bought the hotel . \nWith help from our desk in Washington and the chamber of commerce in Valdez I found a place to stay at the home of the local taxidermist . \nSince joining Reuters in Singapore in 2001 , Corinne has worked as a picture editor on the Asia desk and as an Editor-in-Charge on the global desk . \nIn her current role , Corinne is a member of the online desk in Toronto and is responsible for maintaining the visual elements of www.reuters.com . \nYou can follow Reuters tweets on @reuterspictures \n"}

I want us to sharpen our everyday attitude to operational and technical risk -- to ensure it is the norm for people on the frontline to speak up about risk and for managers to listen , '' Dudley said in an email to staff seen by Reuters . \n`` There is a pressing need to rebuild trust in BP around the world , '' Dudley added . \nNeither in the official or internal statements did Dudley admit that safety failings particular to BP played a role in the oil spill . \nInstead , he repeated BP 's position that the disaster highlighted industry shortcomings -- a line of argument which has enraged BP 's rivals , who accuse the London-based company of having a weak focus on safety and technical excellence . \nAnalysts said investors would be encouraged that Dudley appeared to be willing to take bold steps and that BP was increasing its focus on safety . \n`` It plays well to the U.S. government and to investors who worried that BP had not been as safety conscious as some of its rivals , although we have to see more detail to know how it will work , '' said Iain Armstrong , oil analyst at Brewin Dolphin . \nA blowout in April at BP 's Macondo well caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 men and unleashed America 's worst ever oil spill . \nFears about the final bill for the disaster , along with concerns that BP 's battered image in the United States could make it hard for the company to exploit its assets there , have wiped around $ 60 billion off the company 's stock market value . \nEurope 's second-largest oil company by market value said it was also splitting up its core upstream division into three units : exploration , project development and production , with the aim of fostering technical expertise . \nInglis said in an email to staff seen by Reuters that the change would be implemented over the next month . \nBP 's internal probe into the disaster revealed its main representative on the drilling rig , and possibly his colleagues onshore in Houston whom he may have consulted , were unable to correctly read a basic safety test , thus missing an opportunity to avoid the blast . \nBP has laid most of the blame on its contractors , but rivals said BP 's own account of the disaster showed its practices fell short of industry standards . \nDudley will expand the top management team to include Bly , the heads of the three upstream units , and a new head of strategy and integration . \nEvgeny Solovyov , oil analyst at Societe Generale , said there was a risk that the additional safety oversight and top management positions could slow down decision-making at the company . \n`` I am concerned that BP might become too bureaucratic , '' he said , though he agreed it was crucial for BP to send a message that it was taking safety more seriously if it wanted to preserve its U.S. growth hopes . \n`` BP is in image rebuilding mode , '' Solovyov said . \n-LRB- Editing by Dan Lalor , David Holmes and Will Waterman -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nA gusher blew its top for more than a year about 100 years ago in California . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nIt also said that `` within 28 days of application it does not persist in the environment '' and asked to discuss the situation with the Coast Guard and the EPA before they issue `` directives requiring a change in dispersant products . '' \nSome environmentalists worry the chemicals in dispersants may have a lasting harmful impact . \nEPA Administrator Lisa Jackson will return to the Gulf Coast on Sunday to monitor its response while Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar travels to the BP Command Center in Houston to get an update from the federal science team working on the problem . \nBP made no immediate comment on Obama 's suggestion that it was to blame for the deep-sea disaster . \nBut the company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said he welcomed the establishment of the commission and pledged to work with its co-chairmen . \n`` We share the goal of the president and the public to know what happened to cause this accident and what regulatory and industry changes are needed to help prevent something like this from happening again , '' Hayward said in a statement . \nBP on Friday revised downward an earlier estimate that one of its containment solutions , a 1-mile-long siphon tube inserted into the larger of two seabed leaks , was catching 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day . \nBP captured 2,200 barrels in the 24 hours to midnight , according to the incident response team , the same figure it had for the previous 24-hour period . \n`` To me from the very beginning with BP it was nothing but public relations , '' said Roger Halphen , a south Louisiana school teacher who has worked both in the oil industry and as a commercial fisherman . \n`` It 's just a disaster . \nEverybody was sleeping on this and all of a sudden here it is , '' he said of oil fouling the coast . \nThe weather at least was cooperating . \n`` There 's very little chance of rain and plenty of visibility with low winds and fairly smooth seas , '' said Ken Graham , head of the National Weather Service office in New Orleans . \n`` For things they need to do out there , they 've got a pretty good window of opportunity . \nFavorable conditions are expected through the weekend , he said . \nHigh winds and rough seas can hinder efforts to burn off or skim oil from the surface . \nLouisiana authorities are desperate to start building sand levees to keep the spill from swamping their coast , but experts have serious doubts about the $ 350 million project . \nThe company 's next planned step is a `` top kill '' -- pumping heavy fluids and then cement into the gushing well to plug it . \nMany scientists dismiss an original 5,000 bpd estimate of the total leaking oil -- often defended by BP executives -- as ridiculously low and say it could be 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day or more . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis is a CRIME AGAINST NATURE . \nDICK Cheney and George W Bush layed the foundation for this negligent lack of regulatory oversight that ALLOWED BP 's flagrant , nightmarish lack of safety precautions . \nTHEY ALL SHOULD SENT TO PRISON AND MADE TO PAY a full accounting and WE should try to STOP this criminal behavior towards our mother earth and use SMARTER ways for energy . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nAfter soiling wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , the black tide of pollution has reached some of the famous white beaches of Florida . \nThe toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals , including sea turtles and dolphins , is also climbing . \nBut 47 days into the crisis and after several unsuccessful attempts at containment by BP , a partial solution finally appears at hand . \nThe containment cap that BP clamped over the leak earlier this week was siphoning oil to a waiting drill-ship at a faster rate than initially estimated , U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said at a briefing in Theodore , Alabama . \nBob Fryar , senior vice president with BP , later told a meeting of local mayors in Alabama that the latest undersea containment effort had gone `` extremely well '' so far . \nThe collection rate is still only about one-third of one day 's flow from the oil geyser , which has been estimated by the government at about 19,000 barrels -LRB- 800,000 gallons\\/3 million liters -RRB- per day . \nBut it could mark a turning point in the drama that has riveted the world and forced the Obama administration to reconsider plans to expand offshore oil drilling , which was seen as way to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil . \nAllen said the full capacity of BP 's containment device was about 15,000 bpd , the `` upper limit '' of the current leak control effort . \nBP does not expect to fully halt the oil flow until August , when two relief wells are due to be completed . \nHe said that winds continue to push parts of the vast oil slick closer to the coastline across a wide area -- roughly from the Mississippi-Alabama border to Port St. Joe in the Florida Panhandle , or more than 200 miles . \nFlorida 's fishermen got a glimmer of good news late on Friday when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened about 16,000 square miles -LRB- 41,400 sq km -RRB- that had been closed to fishing on June 2 as a precaution . \nStill , fully one-third of Gulf federal waters , or 78,603 square miles -LRB- 203,582 sq km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing in waters off four states . \nThe U.S. shrimp and oyster supply , in particular , is heavily concentrated in the Gulf . \nIn his weekly radio address on Saturday , Obama defended his administration against charges it had not moved aggressively enough in its response to the worst oil spill in U.S. history , which followed an April 20 rig blast that killed 11 workers . \nObama , who made a third trip to the Gulf coast on Friday , said he has put in place the largest response to an environmental disaster in U.S. history . \nThe government had been `` mobilized on every front , '' he said . \nMeanwhile , BP said it had no specific pre-allocated budget to pay damages claims resulting from the spill , but will pay all those `` hurt , harmed or damaged '' until all legitimate claims are satisfied , `` We will make these payments for as long as it takes ... There is no budget , we 'll do this until it 's finished , '' BP America Vice President of Resources Darryl Willis said in a conference call from Orange Beach , Alabama . \nThe company faces a U.S. criminal probe , several lawsuits , dwindling investor confidence and growing questions about its credit-worthiness . \nIts share price has been stripped of about one-third of its value since the crisis began . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward has insisted the company had plenty of money to meet its obligations , including $ 5 billion in cash and additional credit lines it could tap . \nThe company has said it had already spent $ 1 billion on the disaster . \nIt is preparing to send a second advance payment to individuals and businesses along the Gulf Coast to compensate for the loss of income as a result of the spill . \nAbout 14,000 individuals and businesses will have received about $ 84 million once the second payment is processed . \nThe company delayed a decision on Friday to suspend its quarterly dividend payments , as some U.S. politicians have demanded . \nThe far-flung but fragmented oil slick appeared to make its first landfall in Florida on Friday as tar balls and an oily sheen washed up on Pensacola Beach on the Panhandle . \nTar ball sightings were fewer on Saturday , but residents and environmental officials were still uneasy . \n`` BP ca n't stop it , I do n't think the Navy or the military can stop it , '' said local businessman Michael Penzone . \n`` If we can get people to come out and start praying , maybe something good can come out of this . '' \nLocal officials are bracing for more impact from the spill on Florida 's $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry . \nProtesters planned an anti-BP rally for Sunday at a BP gas station in downtown Pensacola -- although such grass-roots actions are mostly seen as damaging to small business owners who run the stations . \nIn Orange Beach on Alabama 's Gulf shore , BP 's Fryar faced anger from local mayors about what was termed the company 's sluggish response to oil clean-up on local beaches . \n`` We just climbed out of a hole , from two hurricanes and two years of recession . \nThis was going to be a banner year , and BP killed it , '' said Tony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , just west of the Florida border . \nLatest figures from the U.S. government on Friday showed 527 birds across the Gulf Coast have been collected dead over a 45-day period , although not all showed signs of oil . \nTom Bancroft , chief scientist for the National Audubon Society , said the government 's numbers tell only part of the story . \n`` Some -LRB- birds -RRB- just sink under the water and will never be counted , '' he said . \nOf particular concern , Bancroft said , are threatened shore birds that breed on Gulf Coast beaches . \nThe spill could also be `` a really bad setback '' for the brown pelican , Louisiana 's state bird , which was only removed from the endangered species list in 2009 . \nNOAA also reported many heavily oiled sea turtles in the spill zone . \nThe turtles are being caught , cleaned and transported to an Audubon Aquarium outside New Orleans for further care . \nDozens of dead dolphins have also been stranded within the spill area since late April . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt doesnt look like its collecting anything ! \nwww.deepwaterbp.com @dara , the article says they 're collecting only 5 % of the oil so far . \nThat means they 're NOT collecting 95 % of the oil . \nFor some reason this President only seems comfortable when he can threaten those who he sees as a problem , whether that problem is intentional or not . \nIt may hearken back to his days in Chicago politics , or just the defensive instincts of a man lacking the maturity of age and development . \nRegardless of the reason , he stands tall when there is credit to be taken and points fingers in all directions when there is a lack of adoration . \nHe lacks statesmanship and can not even comprehend that as a fact ... he could not recognize it if it confronted him in a narrow hallway . \nBut ... we elected him and fate always sees that we get what we deserve . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1153", "time": "2010-06-02", "text": "VENICE , Louisiana | Wed Jun 2 , 2010 7:56 pm EDT VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc overcame a snag in its latest effort to curb the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as the British energy giant 's shares stabilized on Wednesday and parts of the huge oil slick threatened Florida . \nThe company 's latest plan is to siphon off some of the oil but first robot submarines must cut away what is left of the ruined offshore well 's leaking riser pipe . \nThen a containment cap can be lowered over the remaining wellhead assembly , enabling BP to funnel crude to the surface . \nBut the diamond-tipped saw being used to cut through the pipe became stuck . \nBP employed robotic equipment and struggled for hours to free the saw but finally completed the task , a source familiar with the operation told Reuters . \nIf the saw cuts off remaining pieces of the pipe and provides a smooth surface at the top , BP aims to place a containment cap with a rubber seal over the gushing opening to funnel most of the oil . \nAll this is a difficult task one mile deep . \nAs the desperate effort to contain the gusher proceeded , the slick stretched farther . \nTar balls and other oil debris from the giant , fragmented slick reached Alabama 's Dauphin Island , parts of Mississippi and were less than 10 miles from Florida 's northwest Panhandle coast . \nThe region 's vital seafood and tourism industries were at risk from America 's biggest oil spill ever . \nFlorida , entering the busy beach season , is ramping up reconnaissance efforts and preparing to deploy more booms and conduct coastal cleanups . \nOfficials prepared for landfall that could come as early as Friday . \nBP , now facing an Obama administration criminal investigation , has lost one-third of its market value or about $ 67 billion -LRB- 46 billion pounds -RRB- since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 and triggered the gusher . \nThe company 's latest plan to curb the oil flow after the `` top kill '' strategy failed could represent the last best hope before August , when the company expects to have two relief wells it is drilling to be operational . \nThis latest attempted fix may actually increase the flow of oil , at least temporarily , before the leak can be controlled . \nPresident Barack Obama , facing one of the biggest challenges to his presidency , is under relentless pressure to stop the leak . \nVice President Joe Biden rejected criticism of the administration 's handling of the disaster . \n`` From my perspective , I think if there 's any mistake made -LRB- it is -RRB- that we have n't communicated clearly enough what the president has done on this oil spill from the beginning , '' Biden told PBS ' `` Charlie Rose '' show . \nIn a speech in Pittsburgh , Obama said it is time for the United States to embrace a clean energy future because of the inherent risks of drilling deep into the earth for oil . \n`` The catastrophe unfolding in the Gulf right now may prove to be a result of human error -- or corporations taking dangerous short-cuts that compromised safety , '' Obama said . \nBP shares recovered from an earlier dip to close nearly unchanged in London on Wednesday , while BP American depositary receipts rose more than a point in New York ; both equities plunged over 10 percent on Tuesday . \nSome investors see this as a rare buying opportunity . \nOthers said the stocks could underperform for years despite reduced valuations , and warned the uncertain outcome of the oil spill and risk to profits means investors should expect a bumpy ride in coming months . \nThe cost of insuring the debt of BP , rig operator Transocean and Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which owns a 25 percent stake in the well , hit fresh highs on Wednesday as concerns grew about the companies ' exposure to the spill . \nCredit default swaps protecting BP 's debt jumped 87 basis points to a record 255 basis points , or $ 255,000 per year to insure $ 10 million for five years , according to Markit Intraday . \nThe swaps have jumped from around 100 basis points last Friday and 42 basis points in April . \nBP will seek to patch up its battered share price by reassuring investors the cost of cleaning up the spill is manageable and will not affect dividends , British media reported on Wednesday . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told the Financial Times that he believed the industry could reform itself to justify continued drilling in challenging areas . \nIn a statement , Hayward apologized for saying on Sunday that `` I want my life back , '' a comment that stirred anger in the Gulf region where the spill is destroying livelihoods . \n`` Those words do n't represent how I feel about this tragedy , '' he said . \nA section of Dauphin Island beach well known for its white sand was covered with patches of black and an orange sheen . \nHundreds of workers and around 150 boats set out to lay more protective booms around the island , though they were delayed by a squall that passed over the tourist haven off Alabama 's Gulf Coast . \n`` It is so depressing . \nIt is really happening . \nIt really wo n't go away . \nAnd the American people really do n't know what has hit them , '' said Dauphin Island homeowner Caroline Graves . \nThe containment cap is intended to capture a large portion of the billowing oil and channel it through a hose to a ship on the surface . \nBP must make two cuts on the riser pipe , with the second cut key to ensuring that BP gets a clean seal between the pipe and the containment cap . \nThe cap also is equipped with valves to allow operators to inject methanol or warm water that would prevent the buildup of slushy gas hydrates that thwarted an earlier siphoning effort . \nBut sawing off the end of the damaged riser pipe through which oil has been pouring non-stop could increase the flow of crude by 20 percent until the cap is in place . \nIt could take 72 hours to get the cap operational . \nAs much as 19,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 800,000 gallons or 3 million liters -RRB- a day has been pouring into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana since the rig explosion . \nThe accident ranks as the worst oil spill in U.S. history , surpassing the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska . \nThe spreading slick coincided with the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season , which forecasters say could be the stormiest since 2005 , when Katrina and Rita wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast . \nCommercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf Coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . \nWhile cleanup crews have attacked the oil slick on the surface with skimmers , dispersants and controlled burns , shoreline-protection teams have scurried to block the spread of oil with containment booms , sandbags and other barriers . \nScientists and Gulf residents are most concerned about the encroachment of oil into bayous and marshes teeming with shrimp , oysters , crabs , fish , birds and other wildlife . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPresident Obama should be assembling a team of the finest engineers to find a solution to this debacle . \nHe is not acting with the environment 's best interests at heart . \nBecause I 'm sure there are alot of engineers that Obama has just , not felt like calling already . \nAnd you know , the White House and it 's dozen Departments can only do one thing at a time . \nIs it possible they 've called all the engineers they can get ahold of ? \nIs it possible for the Department of Justice to pursue this while the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy work on the well ? \nStop being ignorant and think . \nWhy are we trusting anything BP says at this point ??

{"id": "1646", "time": "2010-05-13", "text": "Justin Gillis has a great story about how no one with the ability to do anything about it seems remotely interested in measuring the severity of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe ubiquitous 5,000-barrels-a-day number seems to be a massive underestimate , and the stated reason for not getting a better figure is weak indeed : A spokesman , David H. Nicholas , said in an e-mail message that the estimated rate of flow would not affect either the direction or scale of our response , which is the largest in history . \n... I think the estimate at the time was , and remains , a reasonable estimate , said Dr. Lubchenco , the NOAA administrator . \nHaving greater precision about the flow rate would not really help in any way . \nWe would be doing the same things . \nWhy is the NOAA backing BP up on this ? \nKnowing the size of the problem may or may not help in terms of being able to fix this particular problem . \nBut it 's certainly going to be important going forwards . \nWhat 's more , the current estimate could hardly have been friendlier towards BP if it had tried : The 5,000-barrel-a-day estimate was produced in Seattle by a NOAA unit that responds to oil spills . \nIt was calculated with a protocol known as the Bonn convention that calls for measuring the extent of an oil spill , using its color to judge the thickness of oil atop the water , and then multiplying . \nHowever , Alun Lewis , a British oil-spill consultant who is an authority on the Bonn convention , said the method was specifically not recommended for analyzing large spills like the one in the Gulf of Mexico , since the thickness was too difficult to judge in such a case . \nEven when used for smaller spills , he said , correct application of the technique would never produce a single point estimate , like the government s figure of 5,000 barrels a day , but rather a range that would likely be quite wide . \nWhy release a point estimate ? \nWell , if the NOAA had released a range -- say 3,000 to 30,000 barrels a day -- then the press would have gravitated to the higher number , and talked about a spill of `` as much as 30,000 barrels a day '' , and that would be the main number people remembered . \nBut it 's not the NOAA 's job to do PR for BP . \nAnd it is the NOAA 's job to get as much good information about this oil spill as possible . \nSo let 's get down there and measure this thing . \nBP has been slow and apathetic to the oil spill situation from the beginning . \nIt took a week for it to wake up from its stupor and look for help on stopping the oil spilling for its rig in the Gulf of Mexico . \nObama s visit and state and federal criticism has made it sit up . \nThis is a classic case of lawyers , politicians and oil executives fighting it out for money and power , while the human costs mount for ordinary people . \nBut perhaps it 's time to ask how much oil this well might contain , and potentially spew . \nits all part of the coverup ... same as the 300,000 gallons of toxic dispersants to keep it from reaching the surface ... Estimating the oil flowrate seems like a simple exercise . \nThe diameter of the pipe is known , -LRB- and hence the flow area is known -RRB- and one should be able to reasonably estimate the velocity of the oil through the flow area . \nJust looking at the video , I would estimate the velocity around 5-6 feet\\/sec . \nAssuming that all the oil is flowing out of the pipe and no other opening and assuming the pipe is 3 inches in diameter , the flow rate can be calculated as 190,000 gallons per day -LRB- velocity V = 6 feet\\/sec -RRB- So the 200,000 gallons per day does not seem too far off . \nIf all the oil is coming through the pipe , the only two variables needed to be estimated to calculate the flow rate is the diameter of the pipe and the velocity . \nAn estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . \nAlso a velocity of 6 feet\\/sec also seems reasonable given the video and the fact that because frictional flow losses in a pipe varies with the velocity squared , one hardly ever encounters pipe velocites above 20 feet\\/sec . \n-LRB- A flow velocity of 20 feet\\/sec will produce -LRB- 20\\/6 -RRB- ^ 2 = 11.11 times the pipe friction losses of a velocity of 6 feet\\/sec -RRB- . \nhigh_al : all fine , except that the diameter of the well pipe is actually 9 inches . \nBP is doing more to stop offshore drilling than all the environmentalists put together Thnaks for the correction . \n-LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- If it is 9 in , multiply the flow rate by 9 -LRB- -LRB- 9\\/3 -RRB- ^ 2 -RRB- . \nSo instead of 5,000 barrels\\/day , the estimate goes to 45,000 barrels\\/day . \nWho the hell runs this country . \nI voted for President Obama and half the time he acts as if his head is up his arse . \nWhether it is the taking the financial industry to task , the commitment of troops in the Middle East or this ecological cluster % # \\* % , it seems he has a problem with aggressively expressing his authority as President of the United States . \nIf I am not mistaken the territory where the oil spilled occurred is owned by the United States and the Interior Department has dominion . \nThen as the leader of the United States order a survey of the sub surface waters to determine the extent of the oil . \nIDIOTS !!!!!!! `` So let s get down there and measure this thing . '' \nDo you know anything about chemistry and physics ? \nIts not so easy , to just go down there and measure . \nFirst , the oil density changes at the point of release as it moves upward . \nSecond , the oil is mixed with methane , water and there are reactions going on within the plume . \nWhile flow can be theoretically calculated , it must assume these variables . \nAlso , its a mile deep , only robotic submersibles can go down there , and precisely measuring it as you envision , is secondary to stopping the oil flow . \nI think you really need to research the IXTOC I blowout . \nIt is analogous to this incident , except it was far worse , with much higher flow rates , and final oil spill totals . \nInterestingly enough , compared to the total spill , very little oil washed up on beaches . \nMost settled to the sea floor , or dispersed . \nThis appears to be similar , in that very little of the spill has actually washed ashore . \nSo , the numbers dont really matter , only that the flow can be halted . \nObama does n't have any incentive to actually get things right , as more and more problems come to light he can get his agenda of re-engineering the USA from a capitalist society production base pay with the elite producers to a society of Governmental control , nanny State society . \nAll they really need is over 50 % of voters reliant on the Gov enough to favor a very large government to keep the machine in power and money to those it deems in favor at the time . \nAs they say never let a disaster go to waste . \nLike now he is all over the Banks for misconduct but no mention of Freddie or Fannie Mae which is and was the worst waste and main contributor of or financial disaster . \nWe will be in more hard times , and a double dip recession without a complete reversal of this agenda . \nIts already a trillion dollars wasted . \nBP has the resources to compensate those that were effected and clean the spill up . \nRight now they are bringing all these temporary fixes to keep public out cry from getting out of hand , there is only one true fix , is to drill another hole to plug this up . \nWhich they are doing as we write , but will take 1-3 + months . \n`` But it s certainly going to be important going forwards . '' \nCa n't you at least explain why this is so critical that it warrants your article ? \nIs n't such an explanation a reasonable expectation of someone attempting , even poorly , to make a point ? \nWhat is critical is containing the spill as soon as possible . \nWhatever is flowing now will continue to flow regardless of how accurately it 's captured in some entertainment article you wish to write . \nOr perhaps you 're seeking data for a future lawsuit . \nI do n't know . \nIs there any benefit to the environment of capturing an accurate flow rate for an impact that will not be understood for years ? \nFor an impact that is clearly beyond mankind 's control at any depth and on any coastline , short of engineering an ocean floor containment solution ? \nHow much are you willing to spend on getting this critical data point at the expense of containment efforts ? \nHow do you propose doing it ? \nWhere s the rocket scientist ? \nPlease stop making stupid points . \nAnd keep that `` why '' business in mind next time . \nhigh_al at 11:07 am : `` An estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . '' \nhigh_al at 3:42 pm : `` -LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- '' nnniiiceee . . \nwhy do n't you just admit you have no clue what you 're talking about . \nI do n't really see how the actual flow rate is all that relevant . \nIt 's not going to change the attack . \nBP will still be trying to contain the spill as quickly as possible . \nIt 's not going to change the rate at which the relief wells are drilling to cut off the original well . \nWhatever number you assign to the flow is not going to change the current distribution of the oil on the surface . \nThis is just another one of those non-issues that the media comes up with , each journalist trying to trump the other with a `` new angle . '' \nI agree with lucid . \nIt 's not so easy to just go get the number . \nTo accurately measure the rate , you need to isolate the flow such that none of it is leaking . \nYou need to know how much natural gas and water are mixed with the oil . \nPeople who say these kinds of things , or who insist on a risk free world , have probably never taken a science course . \nhigh_al at 11:07 am : An estimate of the diameter of the pipe of 3 inches seems reasonable , I have not seen too many drilling pipes larger than that . \nhigh_al at 3:42 pm : -LRB- A 3 inch pipe did seem a little small -RRB- high_al : all fine , except that the diameter of the well pipe is actually 9 inches . \nThe pipe is 21 inches wide . \nWhere did 3 and 9 inches come from ? \nGulf drillers ' official spill volume estimate appears about as accurate as other avoidable oil-related disasters e.g. civilian death tolls and real cost of waging America 's illegal wars on the Middle East . \nAlong with methane and water there is probably dirt with heavy metals as well . \nCan someone explain why if you can see this pipe why you couldn t just crimp the end of it with some sort of Jaws of Life devise ? \nIf it could contain it temporarily you might be able to secure some sort of dome over it . \nBut if they did shut it off then they couldn t try to siphon off some it for more cash . \nLock some people up and see how quickly they shut it off . \n`` Obama doesn t have any incentive to actually get things right , as more and more problems come to light he can get his agenda of re-engineering the USA from a capitalist society production base pay with the elite producers to a society of Governmental control ... '' rancher You make an interesting point . \nBPs new name is Beyond Petroleum . \nAnd they are aligned with money in the global warming agenda . \nAs another example , Aetna asked for a 35 % increase in rates , just when the Health Care Bill was really hot . \nThere have been quite a few coincidences during this administration . \nI find it ludicrous that this thing has not been fixed . \nI also find it odd that after so many off-shore well drillings that this happened in the first place . \nThere are huge platforms in the North Sea that have been there for decades . \nThat area makes the Gulf look like a swimming pool . \n`` But if they did shut it off then they couldn t try to siphon off some it for more cash . \nLock some people up and see how quickly they shut it off . '' \nIf they shut it off today , all that oil that 's now leaking off would remain in the wellbore and could be recoverable later . \nThe oil that has leaked off is worthless . \nAt a range of 5,000 to 20,000 barrels per day , that 's 120,000 to 480,000 barrels lost . \nAt $ 80\\/barrel that 's $ 10 to $ 40 million they 've lost in oil revenues by not shutting it off immediately . \nIn addition , all the lawsuits and cleanup costs ... Force some people to think for more than two minutes and you 'd see a lot fewer silly comments like this . \n`` I also find it odd that after so many off-shore well drillings -LRB- sic -RRB- that this happened in the first place .

'' \nThe first platform in the Gulf of Mexico was built in 1947 , long before any wells were drilled in the North Sea . \nThere are far more rigs in the Gulf than in the North Sea . \nThe misinformation out there is amazing . \nAll of the sudden , everyone 's an oil industry expert . \nalexhiggens : The riser pipe has a 20 inch interior diameter . \nHowever , the drill pipe that is actually sunk into the reservoir has a 9 inch diameter . \nThat is the pipe that is relevant for determining flow . \nIt 's possible that the pipe may be structurally compromised , or there may be frozen crystals built up , etc. which would affect oil flow . \nAlso , as the oil rises through the pipe , methane gas comes out of suspension as pressure lessens -LRB- like the carbonation in soda -RRB- , so it 's tough to know how much is gas and how much is oil . \nThat said , the pipe into the well is 9 inches . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n"}
{"id": "1362", "time": "2010-05-13", "text": "OTTAWA | Thu May 13 , 2010 3:28 pm EDT OTTAWA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Exasperated Canadian legislators grilled the head of BP Plc Canadian unit on Thursday , concerned about the risks of the company 's plans to drill in Arctic waters after the catastrophic Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nBut Anne Drinkwater , president of BP Canada , offered few answers at a hearing at Parliament 's Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the safety of drilling in the Far North . \nDrinkwater , who has also run BP operations in Indonesia , Angola and Norway , declined to answer technical questions and said she had not compared Canadian and U.S. drilling regulations , straining the credulity of some on the committee . \n`` You 'd think coming to a hearing like this that British Petroleum would have as many answers as possible to assure the Canadian public . \nWe got nothing today from them , '' said Nathan Cullen of the left-leaning New Democrats . \n`` I was very disappointed . \nI think British Petroleum is going to have to do a lot better job if they want to drill in Canadian waters , '' Cullen told reporters afterward . \nLarry Bagnell of the Liberals , after asking Drinkwater to compare regulations in Canada and the United States , said : `` I thought she did n't have answers to a lot of questions ... I was asking for a very simple answer . '' \nCritics say an oil blowout in the Canadian Arctic would be much worse than the current Gulf disaster , given the ice , severe weather conditions and the lack of infrastructure in one of the world 's most remote regions . \nIn 2008 , BP paid C$ 1.2 billion -LRB- $ 1.8 billion -RRB- for rights to explore three parcels in Canada 's Beaufort Sea , north of the Arctic Circle . \nIt has yet to announce plans to drill in the region but shortly before the U.S. disaster , BP and other oil companies urged Canadian regulators to drop a requirement stipulating that companies operating in the Arctic had to drill relief wells in the same season as the primary well . \nCullen argued the companies had made this request because drilling a relief well within the required time limit would be too expensive , given the difficult Arctic conditions . \n`` It 's not a question of cost , '' said Drinkwater . \n`` Your submission does say it 's a question of cost . \n... You cite money because you 're concerned about money , '' retorted Cullen , reading from a BP document filed with the NEB , then listing recent disasters BP had been involved in . \nDrinkwater -- who said BP was not rejecting the option of a relief well -- declined to answer reporters ' questions following the hearing . \nCanadian governments and regulators are reassessing the country 's preparedness for an offshore disaster following the April 20 explosion of Transocean Ltd 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . \nThe explosion killed 11 workers and triggered what could prove to be the worst U.S. oil spill if the crude keeps spewing unchecked into the Gulf . \nThe National Energy Board , Canada 's federal oil and gas regulator , launched a review of Arctic safety and environmental drilling requirements this week and canceled hearings into the relief well issue . \nNEB Chief Executive Gaetan Caron said it was too early to say what the review might conclude . \nAsked whether a similar accident could happen in the Arctic , Caron replied : `` No safety regulator can possibly say that an accident will never happen . '' \nProvincial governments are also reviewing offshore drilling regulations . \nThe government of Nova Scotia on Thursday extended a moratorium on oil and gas exploration on the Georges Bank , an important fishing region , by three years to the end of 2015 . \nThe government of Newfoundland is also launching a review of offshore safety practices , though it said it is satisfied with the current level of environmental protection practiced by the industry . \nIndeed , Chevron Corp earlier this week began drilling a deepwater well in the Orphan basin off the province . \nThe Atlantic off Newfoundland is home to Canada 's three producing oil projects . \n"}

{"id": "555", "time": "2010-05-14", "text": "- Kees Willemse is professor of offshore engineering at Delft University . \nThe opinions expressed are his own . \n- Last month s explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig continues to result in the leakage of an estimated 200,000 gallons -LRB- 910,000 litres -RRB- of oil into the Gulf of Mexico each day . \nAccording to U.S. President Barack Obama , we are dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster . \nWhile the leak is extremely serious , and Obama s words may ultimately ring true , the leak is -LRB- as yet -RRB- not one of the top 50 biggest oil spillages from either oil rigs or tankers in historical perspective : cents Some 7-10 ,000 tonnes of oil are so far estimated to have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from Deepwater Horizon . \ncents The Exxon Valdez leaked some 36,000 tonnes of crude oil on the shores of Alaska . \ncents The largest ever off-shore leakage of oil occurred in 1979 in the Ixtoc-1 spillage when an estimated 476,000 tonnes of oil polluted the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- Bay of Campeche -RRB- . \ncents The biggest ever on-shore spillage occurred in the aftermath of the 1991 Iraq War when an estimated 1.4 to 1.5 million tonnes was released in Kuwait by Iraqi military forces . \nMost at risk from the Deepwater Horizon spill are the coastlines of Texas , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , and Louisiana , including the wetlands near New Orleans where millions of migratory birds are currently nesting , and fish spawning . \nThe oil spill could also be catastrophic for the Gulf Coast s substantial seafood industry , including oysters and shrimp . \nTo mitigate the environmental impact , measures will continue to be taken to prevent as much of the oil as possible reaching the shoreline , including setting fires to burn-off the oil ; soaking up the oil ; and placing protective barriers around shorelines . \nThe precise scale of the unfolding disaster remains uncertain owing to the lack of clarity over how long the leak will last . \nIn the worst-case scenario , as U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has suggested , the leak could continue for several more months . \nUncertainty is also increased by the fact that BP executives are reported to have admitted to members of the U.S. Congress that the amount of oil spilling could intensify -- perhaps by several multiples of the current leakage per day -- if they can not cap the flow . \nHopes for a relatively early end to the leakage are resting largely upon the success of the operation to install a five-storey , 100 tonne containment dome . \nThe device was to be lowered by cranes around 1500 metres to the sea floor and , if possible , positioned over the two areas of leaking pipe . \nIf successful , the dome would serve as a giant funnel , collecting and piping it for collection on the sea surface . \nHowever , this operation has only been applied at a much smaller water depth and the first attempt to employ the device here has not been successful . \nEven if successful , the dome will not stem all of the leakage -LRB- perhaps 80-90 percent of it -RRB- and there remains a risk of explosion when the oil reaches the surface because of the volatile mix of oil , gas and water . \nThus , the operation can only be a holding one to buy time until the spillage can be shut off at the two remaining sources of the leak . \nWhile shutting off the leakage at source will be an immensely difficult task , hopes will have been raised last week by the fact that BP successfully shut off the smallest of the three original leakages . \nThis was done by placing a valve over the ruptured pipe and shutting it off using a remotely controlled submarine . \nThe best hope of shutting off the two remaining sources of leakage is getting the blow-out preventor working again . \nThis is the system , which should act as an emergency cut-off to stop oil continually spilling out if a pipe is damaged , and which failed catastrophically last month . \nHowever , the blow-out preventor is proving immensely hard to fix , in large part because of the exceptional depth of the water . \nHopes rest largely upon robot submarines re-starting the system . \nIn the event that the blow-out preventor can not be fixed , relief wells have begun to be drilled that could be used to siphon off the oil leaking from the holed pipeline . \nThis operation will take an estimated two to three months as the drilling is taking place at 1500 metres water depth and a further 5 kilometres into the hard rock . \nThe relief well can also be drilled such that the shaft of the new well enters into the shaft of the existing , problematic well . \nA cement prop can then be inserted to stop the flow in the first well . \nThis requires extremely accurate drilling , but that technique has been proven before . \nInevitably , all of this environmental mitigation and emergency replacement activity is proving extremely expensive . \nThe cost of operations to BP alone is an estimated 6 million dollars a day , and independent estimates have put the final bill at between 3 billion and 12 billion dollars . \nHowever , the effects of this accident can not be expressed in money terms alone , because of the growing scale of the environmental disaster if the oil spill can not be contained soon . \nOnce the crisis is over , industry and government will need to make an urgent in-depth analysis of the cause of the accident to ensure that similar incidents can never happen again . \nThe Canadian oil sands can finally officially pass the crown Dirty oil off to their rightful owners the offshore producers and shippers . \nOil sands can provide clean and environmentally friendly oil to the world for over a hundred years . \nThis without bringing the hurt and pain to environmentally sensitive regions that do not deserve this again . \nIt s unfortunate that this needed to happen for the world to wake up that an endless supply is located onshore . \nI submitted an idea to BP a few days ago which I believe will work , to stop the leak . \nThey already have a 78 ton metal box which they can put on top of the leak on the ocean floor . \nI suggest they start vacuuming mud off the sea bed and dumping the mud on top of the box . \nEventually , the mud will build up a large roughly conical mound on top of , and around , the box and leak . \nThe weight of the mud bearing down on the box will seal it effectively against the sea bed . \nThe sheer mass of mud will counteract the overpressure of the oil from the well . \nThe relief well currently being drilled will eventually remove the oil overpressure , so the mud can then be removed by pumps and the leak sealed in a more permanent fashion . \nEveryone is worried about the oil coming up uncontrolled from the sea bed . \nThe biggest worrier I have seen so far is BP . \nSure they are losing millions because of this oil floating up and kill fish and wildlife daily . \nThey are also spending millions , without comment about how much money they are spending or for that matter losing on this one site . \nI 'll bet you that 99.9 % of the population worried about this pollution are still buying fuel for their cars . \nOf those I 'd guess that about 50 % of these go to any other company that is not BP . \nYes I can see everyone being mad and worried about this problem happening , I would just see that the support of BP while it is happening a good idea . \nSure if you wish , go to another oil company when the problem is fixed . \nUnfortunately , I am the occupant of an electric wheel chair 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . \nIf I was still able to drive a vechile on the roads , until this problem is solved , I would gladly by my fuel from BP to make a donation so they can clean up ASAP . \nIf its not a blow by or fear for a blow by , its rather simple to replace the so called failing BOP . \n20 years ago I presented my company a concept of an equipment to replace a failing BOP . \nAny way , 27 years ago I presented the oil majors Shell , Exxon and BP a concept for oil drilling ; cheaper , faster and safer . \nMost major advances in oil drilling of the last 25 years were included in that concept ; coiled , monodiameter , underbalanced , snake . \nSo to my opinion the oil spill is a result of rather clumsy

'' \nThe governor of Louisiana , which is still recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , declared a state of emergency and the U.S. military said it was reviewing how it might help the efforts to contain the growing slick . \nShares in London-based BP and Swiss-based rig company Transocean Ltd <RIGN.S> <RIG.N> fell by more than 6 percent on Thursday as investors feared a significantly higher cleanup cost . \nBP is down more than 10 percent and Transocean is down nearly 14 percent since the rig explosion on April 20 . \nShares of oilfield services companies Cameron International Corp <CAM.N> and Halliburton Co <HAL.N> tumbled on fears about their ties to the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nCameron , which supplied the blowout preventer for the rig , said on Thursday it was insured for $ 500 million of liability , if needed . \nHalliburton said it did a variety of work on the rig and was assisting with the investigation . \nThe slick will hit the coast in the Mississippi Delta `` sometime later tomorrow , '' Sally Brice OHare , rear admiral of the Coast Guard , said at the news conference with Napolitano . \nPresident Barack Obama said BP was ultimately responsible for the cost of the cleanup and that his government would use every resource to address the spill . \nThe White House said Obama has been briefed on how the slick may interfere with shipping channels , which could affect tankers delivering petroleum to the U.S. market . \nIt may also have ramifications for proposals in Congress and by Obama to issue new offshore drilling permits . \nInitial indications were that the spill would be worse than one in the Pacific Ocean off Santa Barbara in 1969 which prompted a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts , a ban Obama has said he wants to modify . \nThe Obama administration did not rule out imposing a pause in new deepwater drilling until oil companies can show they can control any spills that may happen . \n`` Everything is on the table , '' Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes told reporters , adding it could take 90 days to install a relief valve to stop the leak . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the rig disaster , the worst in the United States in almost a decade . \nTransocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig sank on April 22 , two days after it exploded and caught fire while the company was finishing a well for BP about 40 miles -LRB- 64 km -RRB- southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River . \nThe daily leak from the well blowout is now estimated at 5,000 barrels or about 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 litres -RRB- . \nThe Navy said it was supplying the Coast Guard with inflatable booms and seven skimming systems . \nBP and the Coast Guard have mounted what the company calls the largest oil spill containment operation in history , involving dozens of ships and aircraft . \nBut they are struggling to control the slick from the leaking well 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metres -RRB- under the sea off Louisiana 's coast . \nAfter underwater robots failed to activate a cutoff valve to stop the leak , BP and the Coast Guard set a `` controlled burn '' on Wednesday to try to prevent the slick from growing . \n`` We will not rest until we have done everything to bring this under control , '' said Andrew Gowers , head of group media for BP , likening the spill 's consistency to `` iced tea '' with the thickness of a human hair . \n`` Chris has been a journalist for Reuters since 2001 , when he joined the Washington DC bureau as a summer intern . \nAs a correspondent in Washington , Chris covered energy policy , reported on Congress , the Supreme Court and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency . \nAs Houston Bureau Chief , Chris oversees a team of five reporters and covers general news topics like the BP oil spill , hurricanes , NASA , and national politics . \nIn addition , Chris oversees a team of Power and Gas reporters in New York and Houston .

{"id": "170", "time": "2010-05-14", "text": "NEW YORK | Fri May 14 , 2010 5:42 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP 's oil spill could make for one of the highest-stakes U.S. Gulf hurricane seasons on record . \nStorms may scuttle clean-up efforts , force containment vessels to retreat , or propel spilled crude and tar balls over vast expanses of sea and beach , scientists said . \nMeteorologists say that climate conditions are ripe for an unusually destructive hurricane season , the storm-prone period that runs from June 1 to the end of November in the Gulf . \nOceanographers say that could hurt the clean-up . \n`` If a storm comes into this situation it could vastly complicate everything , '' said Florida State University oceanography professor Ian MacDonald . \n`` All efforts on the shoreline and at sea , the booms and structures and rigs involved in clean-up and containment , could stop working . '' \nAs thousands of spill responders gird for a clean-up that could last for months or years after the leaking well is capped , weather and ocean currents are emerging as major unknowns , raising anxiety levels , economic and environmental stakes in the Gulf as storm season nears . \nCompounding the uncertainty is how little research has been done on how storms affect oil spills . \nSome believe storm surges may help disperse the oil off shore or break down the slick . \nOther research suggests the oil slick itself could keep storms from gathering strength . \nRecent Atlantic Basin readings showed water temperatures up to 0.8 degrees Celsius above normal , and near a record high for the season . \nEl Nino , which creates wind shear that can prevent Gulf hurricanes from forming , has recently subsided . \nThe factors could spur major storms in the Gulf this year . \n`` It only takes one storm to wreak havoc , '' said Chris Shabbot , a meteorologist at Sempra in Connecticut . \n`` The consensus forecast is for above average storm activity as the El Nino -LRB- event -RRB- decays and the Atlantic is as warm or warmer than 2005 . '' \nColorado State University 's renowned team of forecasters is calling for an above-average hurricane season that may bring 15 named storms this year , eight of hurricane strength . \nAccuweather 's Joe Bastardi also fears a destructive season . \n`` I hate to say it since the oil spill is already affecting people , but I think this hurricane season is going to be big , '' he said in an interview . \nThe next official hurricane season outlook from the government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is due on May 20 . \nMiles and miles of booms have been placed offshore along the Gulf Coast to help stop the slick from making landfall . \nAmid the menacing forecasts , oceanographers and spill-responders are considering how storms and deep ocean currents would affect the movement of spilled oil , which authorities say could soon hit land in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama or Florida . \nThe U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico spans some 1,680 miles . \nThe spill , gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels a day from a subsea oil well 50 miles south of Louisiana , has formed a thin oil slick that covered more than 1,200 square miles in late April , according to Louisiana State University researchers . \nThe slick has been harder to define this month , and may be shrinking , LSU professor Nan Walker said . \nLurking under the sea surface , viscous tar balls are forming , facilitated by wave activity , as the heavier hydrocarbon molecules gradually sink toward the sea-floor , a process that can take months , scientists said . \nExperts are having trouble modeling how the oil will react in water since BP has n't disclosed exactly what kind of crude is spilling . \nLighter oil evaporates quicker and is more easily dispersed by chemicals . \nHeavier crude can be more damaging to marine or bird life , but it could sink faster or be easier to contain . \nAs many as 520 vessels are already responding to the spill throughout the Gulf , according to U.S. authorities . \nEfforts to stop the spill involve drilling relief wells from a seaborne rig , which BP says could take three months . \nThe company is also trying to cap the leak with a metal funnel on the sea-floor , to gather oil into a giant hose connected to a storage ship above . \nBoth of those efforts could be disrupted by tropical storms , which can force evacuation of oil and gas rigs throughout the Gulf . \nPeter Niiler , an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution in San Diego , has researched how even winds caused by a low pressure cycle can displace floating scientific buoys from waters near Florida to Texas in less than a week . \n`` Anything on the ocean surface , including oil , can move very fast and just about anywhere that wind or currents push it , '' Niiler said . \nThe oil slick might even reach waters and shores abroad , scientists and foreign authorities warned this week . \nMexican officials say if the spill persists into the fall it could reach Mexican beaches along the country 's Gulf Coast , the site of famed tourist destinations like Cancun . \nSome of the spilled crude should make its way into the LOOP current , a deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream . \n`` If you look at it , the LOOP current could lead that oil right to Havana , Cuba , '' said Florida State 's MacDonald . \nAfter sweeping near Havana , the LOOP current continues toward the Florida Keys and the Gulf Stream heads up the U.S. Eastern Seaboard . \nSome researchers said a wider dispersion of the spill may be good , and storms could help that process along . \nResearchers at NOAA , in a report last week , said the oil slick may also help to impede storm formation by preventing heat transfer from sea to air . \n`` There are two important issues here : the effect of hurricanes on the spill , and the effect of the spill on hurricanes , '' said Doron Nof , professor of oceanography at Florida State University . \n`` I think what a hurricane would do is break up the oil spill , making it even harder to clean up , '' he said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis simple technique using locally available hay and straw will at least bind up the floating oil and keep it from fouling shorelines . \nSee the video -- it 's amazing . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Navy photo\\/Handout By Caren Bohan and Steve Gorman WASHINGTON\\/PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana | Fri May 14 , 2010 5:45 pm EDT WASHINGTON\\/PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday slammed the companies involved in a massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill as BP Plc readied a siphoning system to contain a growing environmental disaster . \nObama applied further pressure on the companies involved in the unfolding drama , criticizing them for a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of publicly trading blame over the accident in his sternest comments yet on the situation . \nWith oil gushing unchecked from a blown-out well a mile under the Gulf of Mexico , London-based BP began work on its latest short-term fix -- a tube that undersea robots will try to insert into a pipe to funnel oil to the surface . \nThe device could begin siphoning oil late Friday , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . \nThe energy giant 's prior attempt to contain the oil -- a giant containment dome -- failed last week after the appearance of frozen hydrocarbons rendered it useless . \nThe so-called riser insertion tool is `` the best option , the most likely option to combat '' the frozen hydrocarbons , Suttles said . \nIf short-term efforts fail , it will take BP about 90 days to permanently cap the leak with a relief well . \nShares of companies involved in the disaster , including BP , have taken a big hit in recent days , but now other firms that make a living in the Gulf of Mexico 's oil-rich waters are starting to feel financial pain . \nThe U.S. Department of the Interior issued a moratorium on new drilling permits at least until May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . \nBut now , analysts and investors are beginning to fret future implications of the ban . \nIn comments after a meeting with his Cabinet to discuss efforts to stop the spill and minimize its impact on U.S. Gulf Coast communities , Obama said he was angry and frustrated about the spill , which threatens an ecological and economic disaster in the Gulf region . \n`` I have to say , though , I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter . \nYou had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else , '' Obama said . \nObama was referring to testimony this week in Congress by leaders of the three companies involved in the disaster -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . \nNone of the three took responsibility for the spill , and instead blamed one another . \nFisheries and tourism , two of the Gulf Coast 's economic mainstays , along with birds , sea turtles and other wildlife , are threatened by the spreading slick . \nThe accident also could cripple attempts in Washington to overhaul U.S. energy policy . \nObama repeated a demand that BP must pay for the spill 's cleanup and other economic impact on the Gulf region but said the U.S. government would use `` every available resource '' to stop oil from coming ashore . \nHe said he would not `` rest or be satisfied '' until the leak was stopped at its source . \n`` We absolutely understand and share President Obama 's sense of urgency over the length of time this complex task is taking , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said in a statement . \nThe spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . \nIt threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska to become the worst ecological disaster in U.S. history . \nThe tone of Obama 's Rose Garden comments were his sternest yet on the catastrophe . \nIn the aftermath of the spill , the Obama administration was faulted by some for the speed of its response , with some drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \nThe White House rejects the criticism , and Obama 's visit to Louisiana on May 2 to meet with local officials and residents helped to dampen it . \nBut as the leak begins to move ashore , the administration wants to head off any potential political fallout , especially with congressional elections looming in November . \nObama also said he directed U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to undertake a `` top-to-bottom '' review of the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling . \nOn Tuesday , Salazar announced that the agency will be split in order to separate the collection of oil royalties from safety inspection duties . \n`` For too long , for a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agency that permits them to drill , '' Obama said . \nA six-month halt in new drilling would defer as much as 80,000 barrels -LRB- 3.4 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil equivalent per day , or 4 percent of projected production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2011 , according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie . \n`` Longer term , after the moratorium is eventually lifted the cost implications of this accident on future drilling could prove significantly detrimental for the industry , '' research firm Raymond James said in a note to clients on Friday . \nA U.S. lawmaker on Friday urged BP to provide more information about how much oil is gushing from its ruptured well , noting that estimates range from 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . \nDemocratic Representative Edward Markey said the public deserves to know exactly how much oil will end up in the ocean and ultimately on U.S. coastlines . \nBP , whose shares have tumbled and wiped out $ 30 billion of market value since the April 20 rig fire , has said the oil spill had cost it $ 450 million so far . \nBP shares dropped more than 3 percent in London on Friday . \nBP defended its lower spill estimate of 5,000 bpd . \n`` I think that 's a good range , '' Suttles said on CNN . \n`` I do n't know the precise number , but I think it 's somewhere around that number .

'' said Kenneth Feinberg of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility on a conference call as the program stopped taking emergency claims and started work on final settlements . \nHe warned that Gulf Coast people and businesses who decline to settle and refuse to give BP and its contractors a release from future risk of lawsuits might end up getting less money . \n`` There is no guarantee that , in the future , a lump sum final payment will be as generous as it will be currently , '' Feinberg said . \nThe April 20 blowout of BP 's Macondo well while it was being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana killed 11 rig workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil , closing fisheries and stunting tourism from Louisiana to Florida . \nAfter the emergency claims filing period ended Tuesday , Feinberg outlined a final settlement process starting Wednesday that gives claimants two options . \nThey can accept a lump sum final payment in exchange for releasing BP and its contractors from future liability . \nOr they can continue to receive interim payments in hopes of a bigger final payment in the future . \nInterim payments to claimants who filed by Tuesday could continue on a quarterly basis for as long as three years , the planned life of the fund , while they await final resolution . \nClaimants also have the option to appeal inside the program . \nA process allows claimants and BP limited opportunities to challenge the fund 's decisions . \nA three-judge panel will handle appeals , Feinberg said . \nThose who elect not to settle have the right to go outside the claims payment program and appeal to the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. federal courts , Feinberg said . \nCritics , who note that BP hired Feinberg , have questioned the speed and fairness of compensation and the fairness of demanding that claimants promise never to sue BP or its contractors before they can get a final settlement . \n`` Until we finish our negotiations with Mr. Feinberg , I advise claimants against signing a release or accepting a final payment without first consulting an attorney , '' Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said in a statement . \nFeinberg said final settlements now will be more generous to cover possible future losses . \nHe also said he is listening to critics , has made adjustments and expects to make more changes as the process evolves . \n`` I plan to deal with the problem , '' Feinberg said . \n`` There 's going to be inconsistencies . \nThere 's going to be mistakes . \nAnd I plan to address those mistakes .

{"id": "822", "time": "2010-07-02", "text": "By Nastassia Astrasheuskaya , Ben Judah , Alina Selyukh MOSCOW\\/WASHINGTON | Fri Jul 2 , 2010 11:22 am EDT MOSCOW\\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - His face wracked by age and his voice rasping after decades of chain-smoking coarse tobacco , the former long-time Russian Minister of nuclear energy and veteran Soviet physicist Viktor Mikhailov knows just how to fix BP 's oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` A nuclear explosion over the leak , '' he says nonchalantly puffing a cigarette as he sits in a conference room at the Institute of Strategic Stability , where he is a director . \n`` I do n't know what BP is waiting for , they are wasting their time . \nOnly about 10 kilotons of nuclear explosion capacity and the problem is solved . '' \nA nuclear fix to the leaking well has been touted online and in the occasional newspaper op-ed for weeks now . \nWashington has repeatedly dismissed the idea and BP execs say they are not considering an explosion -- nuclear or otherwise . \nBut as a series of efforts to plug the 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing from the sea floor have failed , talk of an extreme solution refuses to die . \nFor some , blasting the problem seems the most logical answer in the world . \nMikhailov has had a distinguished career in the nuclear field , helping to close a Soviet Union program that used nuclear explosions to seal gas leaks . \nOrdinarily he 's an opponent of nuclear blasts , but he says an underwater explosion in the Gulf of Mexico would not be harmful and could cost no more than $ 10 million . \nThat compares with the $ 2.35 billion BP has paid out in cleanup and compensation costs so far . \n`` This option is worth the money , '' he says . \nAnd it 's not just Soviet boffins . \nMilo Nordyke , one of the masterminds behind U.S. research into peaceful nuclear energy in the 1960s and '70s says a nuclear explosion is a logical last-resort solution for BP and the government . \nMatthew Simmons , a former energy adviser to U.S. President George W. Bush and the founder of energy investment-banking firm Simmons & Company International , is another calling for the nuclear option . \nEven former U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced support for the idea of an explosion to stem the flow of oil , albeit one using conventional materials rather than nukes . \n`` Unless we send the Navy down deep to blow up the well and cover the leak with piles and piles and piles of rock and debris , which may become necessary ... unless we are going to do that , we are dependent on the technical expertise of these people from BP , '' Clinton told the Fortune\\/Time\\/CNN Global Forum in South Africa on June 29 . \nClinton was picking up on an idea mooted by Christopher Brownfield in June . \nBrownfield is a one-time nuclear submarine officer , a veteran of the Iraq war -LRB- he volunteered in 2006 -RRB- and now a nuclear policy researcher at Columbia University . \nHe is also one of a number of scientists whose theories rely not on nuclear bombs -- he did toy with that thought for a while -- but on conventional explosives that would implode the well and , if not completely plug it with crushed rock , at least bring the flow of oil under control . \n`` It 's kind of like stepping on a garden hose to kink it , '' Brownfield says . \n`` You may not cut off the flow entirely but it would greatly reduce the flow . '' \nUsing nuclear blasts for peaceful ends was a key plank of Cold War policy in both the United States and the Soviet Union . \nIn the middle of last century , both countries were motivated by a desire to soften the image of the era 's weapon of choice . \nWashington had big plans to use peaceful nuclear explosions to build an additional Panama Canal , carve a path for an inter-state highway through mountains in the Mojave Desert and connect underwater aquifers in Arizona . \nBut the experimental plans were dropped as authorities learned more about the ecological dangers of surface explosions . \nThe Soviet program , known as Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy , was launched in 1958 . \nThe project saw 124 nuclear explosions for such tasks as digging canals and reservoirs , creating underground storage caverns for natural gas and toxic waste , exploiting oil and gas deposits and sealing gas leaks . \nIt was finally mothballed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 . \nThe Soviets first used a nuclear blast to seal a gas leak in 1966 . \nUrtabulak , one of its prized gas-fields in Uzbekistan , had caught fire and raged for three years . \nDesperate to save the cherished reserves , Yefim Slavsky , then Minister of Light Industry , ordered nuclear engineers to use the most powerful weapon in their arsenal . \n`` The Minister said , ` Do it . \nExplode it , ' '' recalls Albert Vasilyev , a young engineer and a rising star in the project who now teaches at the Lenin Technical Institute in Moscow . \nVasilyev remembers the technology behind the program with obvious pride . \n`` The explosion takes place deep underground , '' he says . \n`` We pinch the pipe , break it and the pipe collapses . '' \nAccording to Vasilyev , the blast at Urtabulak sealed the well shut leaving only an empty crater . \nIn all , the Soviets detonated five nuclear devices to seal off runaway gas wells -- succeeding three or four times , depending on who you talk to . \n`` It worked quite well for them , '' says Nordyke , who authored a detailed account of Soviet explosions in a 2000 paper . \n`` There is no reason to think it would n't be fine -LRB- for the United States -RRB- . '' \nBut not everything went smoothly . \nVasilyev admits the program `` had two misfires '' . \nThe final blast in 1979 was conducted near the Ukrainian city of Kharkov . \n`` The closest houses were just about 400 meters away , '' Vasilyev recalls . \n`` So this was ordered to be the weakest of the explosions . \nEven the buildings and the street lamps survived . '' \nUnfortunately , the low capacity of the device failed to seal the well and the gas resurfaced . \nAlexander Koldobsky , a fellow nuclear physicist from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute , insists the peaceful nuclear explosions were safe . \nThe people who worked on the program `` were brilliant professionals '' , he says . \n`` They had a culture of safety , which did not accept the word ` maybe ' , but only accepted the words ` obligation ' and ` instruction . ' \nAny derivation from these in nuclear technologies is a crime . '' \nStill , he concedes , `` there were different scenarios of what happened after an explosion . '' \nAt his first blast in a Turkmen gas field in 1972 , `` the stench was unbearable , '' he says . \n`` And the wind was blowing toward a nearby town . '' \nHe closes his narrow lips into a smile as if refusing to say more . \nKoldobsky shrugs off any suggestion of fear or emotion when the bomb exploded . \n`` I felt nothing . \nI was just doing my job . '' \nNot everybody is so sanguine about the Soviet experience . \nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , an expert from Russia 's largest oil exporter Rosneft , urges the United States to ignore calls for the atomic option . \n`` That would bring Chernobyl to America , '' he says . \nVladimir Chuprov from Greenpeace 's Moscow office is even more insistent that BP not heed the advice of the veteran Soviet physicists . \nChuprov disputes the veterans ' accounts of the peaceful explosions and says several of the gas leaks reappeared later . \n`` What was praised as a success and a breakthrough by the Soviet Union is in essence a lie , '' he says . \n`` I would recommend that the international community not listen to the Russians . \nEspecially those of them that offer crazy ideas . \nRussians are keen on offering things , especially insane things . '' \nFormer Minister Mikhailov agrees that the USSR had to give up its program because of problems it presented . \n`` I ended the program because I knew how worthless this all was , '' he says with a sigh . \n`` Radioactive material was still seeping through cracks in the ground and spreading into the air . \nIt was n't worth it . '' \n`` Still , '' he says , momentarily hard to see through a cloud of smoke from his cigarettes , `` I see no other solution for sealing leaks like the one in the Gulf of Mexico . '' \nThe problem , he goes on , is that `` Americans just do n't know enough about nuclear explosions to solve this problem ... But they should ask us -- we have institutes , we have professionals who can help them solve this . \nOtherwise BP are just torturing the people and themselves . '' \nNordyke too believes the nuclear option should be on the table . \nAfter seeing nine U.S. nuclear explosions and standing behind the control board of one , he estimates that a nuclear bomb would have roughly an 80 to 90 percent chance of successfully blocking the oil . \nAccording to his estimates , it would have to be an explosion of around 30 kilotons , equivalent to roughly two Hiroshima bombs or three times as big as Mikhailov 's estimate . \nThe explosion would also need to remain at least 3 to 4 miles away from other offshore wells in the area . \nThe bomb , says Nordyke , would be dropped in a secondary well approximately 60-70 feet away from the leaking shaft . \nThere it would create a large cavity filled with gas . \nThe gas would melt the surrounding rock , crush it and press it into the leaking well to close it shut . \nAlthough the BP well is thousands of feet deeper than those closed in the Soviet Union , Nordyke says the extra depth should n't make a difference . \nHe also says that so far below the ground , not much difference exists in onshore or underwater explosions -- even though the latter have never been tried . \nNordyke says fears that radiation could escape after the explosion are unfounded . \nThe hole would be about 8 inches in diameter and , despite the shockwave , the radiation should remain captured . \nEven in the case of radiation escape , he says , its dispersed effect would be less than that of floating oil patches . \nBut do n't expect an explosion under the Gulf of Mexico any time soon . \nEven a conventional blast could backfire and cause more problems . \nThere is a chance any blast could fracture the seabed and cause an underground blowout , according to Andy Radford , petroleum engineer and American Petroleum Institute senior policy adviser on offshore issues . \nThe U.S. Department of Energy has no plans to use explosives `` due to the obvious risks involved , '' according to a DOE spokeswoman . \nThere 's also the question of time . \nPreparations for a nuclear explosion could take up to half-a-year ; BP has said it will have a relief well in place to stop the leak by August . \n`` I think it has to be considered as only the last resort , '' Nordyke says . \nBut `` they ought to be thinking about it . '' \nWould he be willing to work on such an operation ? \n`` I 'd be happy to help , '' he says . \n-LRB- Reporting by Nastassia Astrasheuskaya and Ben Judah in Moscow and Alina Selyukh in Washington ; editing by Simon Robinson and Sara Ledwith -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nparallel proximity shaft place proper amount of explosives seal new shaft detonate ! \nconventional explosive are well understood and should be adequate to blow bedrock through a 21 ? \nshaft -- how about tunnels through mountains or Hover Dam ! \nsuggested nuclear explosion is absolutely ludicrous and at least 1000 times overkill . \nThis could fracture the seabed floor collapsing into oil reserve and releasing 25,000 cubic miles of oil or 1,000,000,000,000 gallons . \nI was not aware BP had nukes to use ... this news is most startling . \nMikhailov does not know what BP is waiting for ? \nIf they have that much implied power I dont either . \nThis is a great idea ! \nThis way it elimate all forms of sealife , contimate the waters . \nAs Michael said above they would just have skim the oilfrom now on . \nNo more deep ocean drilling !!

{"id": "548", "time": "2010-10-12", "text": "LONDON | Tue Oct 12 , 2010 1:41 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell Plc has criticized the investigation that rival BP Plc conducted into the causes of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and the design BP chose for its blown out well . \nPeter Voser told the Oil and Money conference in London on Tuesday that to correctly investigate the accident one had to examine the thinking behind the particular well design BP used -- something BP 's report did not consider . \nThe Macondo well design included a number of cheaper options , including the use of a single tube from the surface to the reservoir , rather than two overlapping tubes , and U.S. lawmakers said these choices reflected a tendency on BP 's part to put profits before safety . \n`` Shell clearly would have drilled this well in a different way and would have had more options to prevent the accident , '' Voser said , referring to Shell 's preference to include more barriers to hydrocarbon leaks in its well designs . \nThe chief executive of driller Noble Corp , who was speaking at the same conference , also challenged BP 's claim that the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- on the rig failed , and alleged that the failure to correctly read the well was the real cause of the accident . \nThe Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in April after an uncontrolled surge of oil and gas went up the well . \nthe sinking of the rig led to the worst oil spill in United States history . \nBP has blamed the failure of the BOP , a stack of valves designed to cut off well flows in the event of a high-pressure surge , and human errors , largely on the part of its contractors , for the rig blast . \nBut Noble 's chief executive David Williams said the cause of the blast was not the BOP . \n`` It was caused by a failure of the individuals involved to identify what the well was telling them , '' he told the conference , referring to the fact that rig staff did not shut in the well despite rising pressure and other warning signs . \nHe said the BOP may not have even failed at all , given speculation that pieces of piping were found inside the device . \nIf this came from dislodged piping in the well , it could also call BP 's well design into question . \nBernard Duroc-Danner , chief executive of oil services company Weatherford said it was a mistake to rely on BOPs to avert disasters . \n`` BOPs should be , in many ways , redundant , '' he told the conference . \nBP has come under fire from rivals who have suffered heavy losses due to the drilling ban imposed by President Barack Obama in the wake of the oil spill . \nNonetheless , Voser accepted that Shell and others had not invested enough in developing solutions to clean up spills . \n`` The industry was not prepared to handle this spill , '' he said . \nVoser said he expected tighter regulation following the spill and that in future Shell would be more selective about who it would partner with on projects in the Gulf of Mexico . \nShell 's CEO also said that his company was making progress in Iraq , where it won a contract to develop the Majnoon field last year . \nShell has raised output at the field to 70,000 barrels of oil per day from 45,000 bbls\\/day previously . \nHe also said Shell was abiding by United Nations sanctions against Iran but added : `` I have not given up my long term hope that we can actually develop sources in Iran .

{"id": "39", "time": "2010-08-19", "text": "WASHINGTON | Thu Aug 19 , 2010 4:46 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The BP oil spill left a large plume of hydrocarbons in deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico , and those chemicals could be there for some time , oceanographers reported on Thursday . \nAt least 22 miles long , 1.2 miles wide and 650 feet high , the plume was detected more than 3,000 feet beneath the Gulf 's surface during a scientific expedition that ended in late June , the scientists said at a news briefing . \nIt is impossible to say at this point whether the compounds in the plume are toxic to wildlife in the area , but the oceanographers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution said that deep-sea microbes were degrading it relatively slowly , which means it could persist . \nThe fact that the plume exists at all is significant , said Chris Reddy of Woods Hole , who was part of the expedition and co-authored a report about its findings in the journal Science . \n`` If you asked me -- and I have been studying oil spills for 15 years -- whether or not you would see oil subsurface , I would say no , does n't oil float ? '' \n`` So this is an important aspect in the basic science world . '' \nThis showed that subsurface oil droplets were not being easily degraded by microbes , as some observers had speculated . \nReddy noted the unpredictable nature of underwater microbes . \n`` Telling a microbe what to do is like trying to push a teenager around , '' he said . \n`` It is really hard . \nSometimes they kick in . \nSometimes they do n't ... Microbes are pretty selective in how they eat oil . '' \nBy measuring the specific petroleum hydrocarbons in the plume , the researchers determined that it had to have come from the broken BP Macondo well , and not from oil seeps that come naturally from the sea bottom in the Gulf . \nNO SIGN OF `` DEAD ZONE '' In June , the scientists observed the plume moving slowly southwest of the blowout , and started tracking it about three miles from the wellhead and out to 22 miles before they were forced from the area by the approach of Hurricane Alex. The plume looked `` like spring water '' and had no visible oil droplets or petroleum smell , the oceanographers said . \nBut it had enough of the hydrocarbons they were sampling to qualify as a subsurface plume . \nThe Woods Hole researchers also found no evidence of a low-oxygen `` dead zone '' in the area of the plume . \nTheir expedition used a robot submarine that was able to detect oil as a bloodhound sniffs a scent , as well as a mass spectrometer that tracks which chemicals are present . \nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation . \nThe Woods Hole researchers declined to comment specifically about the U.S. government 's August 4 assessment that 50 percent of the oil from the BP spill is gone from the Gulf , with most of the rest rapidly degrading . \nNearly three-fourths of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil released after the April 20 blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig can be accounted for , according to the government report : 25 percent was burned , skimmed or directly recovered from the wellhead ; 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved and 24 percent was dispersed , either naturally or chemically . \nNo oil has leaked into Gulf waters since July 15 , when BP placed a provisional cap over the wellhead . \nHowever , the National Wildlife Federation reported in August that cases of wildlife affected by oil , including endangered sea turtles , appear to be increasing . \nThe August 4 report , prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , drew criticism on Thursday from Representative Ed Markey at a hearing on seafood safety . \n`` I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' Markey said . \n`` Overconfidence breeds complacency and complacency is what got us into this situation in the first place . '' \nBill Lehr of NOAA told the hearing that all seafood samples from reopened waters or outside the closed area of the Gulf of Mexico have passed sensory and chemical testing for contamination of oil and dispersants . \n"}

Coast Guard\\/Handout\\/Files NEW ORLEANS | Sun Jul 4 , 2010 12:13 am BST NEW ORLEANS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A supertanker adapted to scoop up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico began tests Saturday amid a report that some major investors expect the energy giant to replace its top executives . \nThe vessel named `` A Whale '' and dubbed a `` super skimmer '' is operating just north of the blown out well as part of a two-day test watched by the U.S. Coastguard , said Bob Grantham , spokesman for TMT Shipping Offshore , which owns the ship . \nIf all goes to plan TMT hopes to sign a clean-up contract for the ship , which can remove up to 500,000 barrels -LRB- 21 million gallons -RRB- of oil and water mix from the sea surface a day , according to crew members . \nEfforts by BP to contain the damage returned to normal after a hurricane and the British company said its oil-capture systems at its leaking well collected or burnt off 25,290 barrels of oil during operations Friday . \nThe storm passed through the spill area off the coast of Louisiana without doing major damage . \nBut the corporate fall-out from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history appeared far from over . \nThe Financial Times newspaper reported BP investors expected to see a change in the company 's leadership , possibly once the leak is capped , with both Chief Executive Tony Hayward and Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg in jeopardy . \n`` When this is over there will be a full investigation , and we would expect some action to replace the top team , '' the British newspaper quoted a top 10 UK shareholder as saying in its Saturday edition . \nWithout steps to steady the ship , BP could become a takeover target of companies like ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell or PetroChina , the FT said , citing a source working on BP 's strategy . \nA BP spokesman declined to comment . \nBP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion -LRB- 65.7 billion pounds -RRB- and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . \nCompany executives have been under intense pressure since an April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and unleashed the torrent of oil now threatening wildlife and the tourist and fishing industries in the Gulf region . \nThe Obama administration has also criticized the company 's response to the crisis , now in its 75th day . \nThe U.S. Interior Department , one of the departments spearheading Washington 's response to the spill , could issue a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium for U.S. waters in the coming week . \nA federal court last week lifted a six-month drilling ban imposed by the Obama administration as a result of the spill . \nThe new moratorium is expected to be more flexible and could be adjusted to allow drilling in certain subsea fields . \nThe supertanker works by allowing polluted water to enter 12 horizontal slits near its port and starboard bow . \nThe liquid then enters a series of tanks where the oil is decanted and then stored for later transfer to a separate vessel . \nTest results are due Monday , Grantham said , but crew members are confident of success because of a previous test off the coast of Portugal where the ship was fitted out and because the process follows established principles of physics . \nThe total amount of oil and water mix from the spill remains unknown but the ship could in theory greatly boost the amount being collected each day . \nApart from economic damage , the spill is seen as an environmental catastrophe for the Gulf coast . \nWhale sharks , the biggest fish in the sea , may be the latest victims . \nOfficials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this week that four of the polka-dotted creatures , stretching about 40 feet -LRB- 12 metres -RRB- in length , had been spotted swimming in oily water in search of food . \nSince whale sharks are filter feeders -- scooping up plankton and small fish as they swim just beneath the surface -- scientists are concerned they could be harmed or killed from swallowing large amounts of oil . \n`` The problem is that these are surface feeding animals and if they digest the oil they will sink and we will not know how many are dying , '' said Dr. Eric Hoffmayer of the University of Southern Mississippi . \n`` I do n't think there is any question we 're going to lose whale sharks to this oil spill . \nThat 's why we need to tag these sharks so that we can determine how they are impacted by the oil , '' Hoffmayer told Reuters Friday . \n"}

'' \nAt the time , Dudley said the `` best estimate '' of the flow rate was 5,000 bpd . \nA government panel later put the flow rate at 62,000 bpd . \nBP 's rivals including Chevron , Exxon Mobil , and Royal Dutch Shell , have said they would not have drilled the blown-out well the way BP did . \nThe companies have also rankled at BP 's argument that the disaster highlighted failures in the industry , rather than flaws specific to BP . \nHowever , BP 's own internal report into the disaster placed the blame largely on the contractors BP hired to drill and cement the well . \nCongressman Ed Markey slammed Dudley 's comments . \n`` BP is continuing to point the finger at everyone but themselves . \nSince this disaster began , BP has stood for `` Blame Passed ' , '' he said in an emailed statement . \nMarkey said Dudley had refused a request to address a congressional hearing to discuss the spill and asked him to reconsider . \nDudley also thanked the British government for its `` stalwart support '' in the face of harsh attacks from U.S. lawmakers during the crisis . \n`` At the height of the crisis it made a big difference knowing we had such good friends at home , '' the U.S.-born Dudley said . \nSeparately on Monday , BP said it was to sell fields in the Gulf to Japanese group Marubeni Corp for $ 650 million as it seeks to raise up to $ 30 billion from asset sales to pay for the oil spill . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin ; Editing by Dan Lalor and David Cowell -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nFirst BP says that on 5K barrels\\/day are pouring out , when all along it was 25K . \nThen BP sprays chemicals throughout the Gulf and wo n't release the names of the chemicals . \nThe BP blames the whole thing on the drillers , in the meantime ... . . \nBP is spending $ millions on television the they `` will do the right thing '' while funding climate change deniers in the Tea Party and Republican party . \nSo go blame the media . \nThat 's exactly what Cheney and Bush did for 8 years . \nYou are in good company . \nI was unaware that the Tea Party movement was funded by BP . \nI thought they had considerable assistance from the Koch brothers -- so their support is rooted in the oil industry and its climate change deniers . \nHowever it is possible that BP is funding American candidates -- American politics thrives on all world currencies . \nAce , let 's see . \nIt was a democratically controlled congress and a democratic President that was in charge of the governments oversight of BP and the oil spill . \nAll of the misinformation and the failed timely response to and management of the crisis happened under democratic leadership . \nThe way the Obama administration managed the crisis made the democrats look like fools . \nIt was embarrassing to say the least . \nAnd your response is to blame it on the Tea party . \nThis is the prime reason why democrats are going to be thrown out of office . \nThe only thing you guys are good at is pointing the finger , you never take responsibility . \nI am an independent and neither you democrats nor the republicans have me fooled one little bit . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "781", "time": "2011-01-06", "text": "WASHINGTON | Thu Jan 6 , 2011 4:17 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Bacteria ate nearly all the potentially climate-warming methane that spewed from BP 's broken wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico last year , scientists reported on Thursday . \nNearly 200,000 tons of methane -- more than any other single hydrocarbon emitted in the accident -- were released from the wellhead , and nearly all of it went into the deep water of the Gulf , researcher David Valentine of the University of California-Santa Barbara said in a telephone interview . \nBacteria managed to take in the methane before it could rise from the sea bottom and be released into the atmosphere , but the process contributed to a loss of about 1 million tons of dissolved oxygen in areas southwest of the well . \nThat sounds like a lot of oxygen loss , but it was widely spread out , so that the bacterial munching did not contribute to a life-sapping low-oxygen condition known as hypoxia , said Valentine , whose study was published in the journal Science . \nWhat happens to methane has been a key question for climate scientists , because methane is over 20 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide . \nLike carbon dioxide , methane comes from natural and human-made sources , including the petroleum industry . \nFor two months after the BP blowout on April 20 , 2010 , methane was not being consumed in and around the wellhead , leading some scientists to suspect it might linger in the water and eventually make its way into the air , where it could potentially trap heat and contribute to climate change . \n`` If you have a very large release of methane like this , and it did make it into the atmosphere , that would be a problem , '' Valentine said . \n`` There have been a number of ... large-scale methane releases in the past that have come from the ocean that have warmed the climate . '' \nThose methane releases came from natural sources , and researchers like Valentine and his co-authors wondered what role bacteria might have had in those cases . \nThe BP spill offered an `` accidental experiment '' that showed particular bacteria with an all-methane diet multiplied quickly as the methane spread with the underwater plume from the broken well . \nPeak consumption of methane probably came in late July and early August , Valentine said . \nOther organisms dealt with other hydrocarbons , including ethane and propane emitted in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe methane-eating bacteria were the last to the hydrocarbon banquet , and based on past observation , the scientists questioned whether they could do the job . \n`` Given observations about how slowly methane is normally consumed , we did n't think the -LRB- bacteria -RRB- population was up to the challenge at all ... we thought it would be a lot slower , '' Valentine said . \nThe fact the bacteria took in that large amount of methane could indicate that bacteria might absorb other large-scale deep ocean methane releases , the scientists said . \nThe U.S. government filed a civil suit last month against BP and its partners for damage caused by the spill . \nThe White House commission on the oil spill said on Wednesday that BP and its partners made a series of cost-cutting decisions that ultimately contributed to the spill . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI do n't think we could produce enough GM bacteria to handle the load . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe annual summer `` dead zone '' in the Gulf is fueled by farm chemicals carried by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers . \nNitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural runoff stimulates algae growth in the Gulf . \nWhen these tiny plants or fecal matter from animals that eat them settles to the bottom waters , decomposition of this organic material by bacteria consumes oxygen in the water , the consortium said . \nThe result , the researchers said , is oxygen depletion that forces many types of fish , shrimp and crabs to leave the area or suffocate . \nAnimals that live in the sediments that can survive with little oxygen will die if the oxygen level falls toward zero . \nTo be considered hypoxic , oxygen content in the bottom waters of the Gulf must reach the level of 2 parts per million or less . \nBy late July , large patches of the northern Gulf had reached that level , including one swath off Texas 's Galveston Bay . \nWhile the area of the BP oil spill overlaps some parts of the `` dead zone , '' Rabalais said , `` It would be difficult to link conditions seen this summer with oil from the BP spill in either a positive or negative way .

{"id": "22", "time": "2010-07-19", "text": "This piece first appeared in The Washington Post . \nFor weeks people on both sides of the Atlantic have been speculating over who would lose his job first because of the BP spill Ken Salazar , the interior secretary , or Tony Hayward , the oil company s chief executive . \nGiven last week s initial progress in capping the well , I won t try to name a favorite in that race . \nBut I would like to suggest a third , inanimate , culprit : the cult of corporate social responsibility . \nAs crude poured into the Gulf of Mexico and the world economy struggled to recover from the financial crisis , corporate social responsibility might seem a perverse target . \nSurely we need more corporate responsibility , not less . \nBut many of the business disasters of the past 24 months have been facilitated by the mini-industry of corporate social responsibility known as CSR by those in the trade a fetish encouraged by the philanthropies that feed off it and funded by the corporate executives who have found that it serves their bottom line . \nConsider BP s Beyond Petroleum campaign . \nBefore the spill transformed that slogan into a punch line for late-night comedians , Madison Avenue had lauded BP s effort to position itself as the greenest fossil fuel producer : Beyond Petroleum won two PRWeek campaign of the year awards and a gold Effie from the American Marketing Association . \nOgilvy , the firm that invented the slogan , still boasts of Beyond Petroleum as a successful case study on its Web site . \nOr how about Goldman Sachs s 10 ,000 Women project ? \nThis initiative to organize and fund business education for 10,000 underserved women around the world is the limousine of CSR drives : smart , innovative and absolutely in tune with Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn s Half the Sky zeitgeist . \nBut the gulf oil spill and the financial crisis have taught us , rather brutally , that the heart of the relationship between business and society doesn t lie with the charitable deeds companies do in their off-hours but whether they are doing their day jobs in ways that help or hurt the rest of us . \nWhile BP was winning plaudits for being the first oil company to accept global warming as a scientific fact , the old-school Texas oilmen at ExxonMobil were unfashionably unapologetic about their core mission : to produce oil . \nChastened by the Exxon Valdez disaster , however , they also became religious about safety standards . \nWith hindsight , that attention to safety turns out to have had much greater social value than any number of creative CSR drives . \nThe same story played out on Wall Street . \nSo much of the wealth of the gilded early naughties trickled down into 10,000-women-style clever charitable initiatives that my friends Matthew Bishop and Michael Green were inspired to coin a term to describe the phenomenon : philanthro-capitalism . \nYet the considerable social good done by those projects pales in comparison with the destruction wreaked by the made-on-Wall Street financial crisis of 2007-08 . \nThe problem with CSR is that it muddies the waters . \nGoldman s purpose isn t to educate women ; BP s isn t to lead the green revolution . \nThe job of business is to make money in BP s case by producing energy , particularly fossil fuels ; in Goldman s case through finance . \nEven the most cuddly , caring chief executive is ultimately charged with a selfish central mission : to generate profit for her shareholders . \nForgetting that core goal which the CSR culture can tempt us to do is bad news for business leaders . \nIt was a sad day for American capitalism this spring when Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein decided that it was politically unsafe to admit to Congress that he is very good at his job : in this instance , making the right bet on subprime mortgages . \nEven more deplorable was the moment a year earlier when President Obama used his bully pulpit to bully business in this instance , the Chrysler bondholders , whose only sin was to stand up for economic self-interest and that of their investors . \nBut getting confused about the principal job of business is even more dangerous for the state . \nCSR , and the communitarian philosophy behind it , asks us to believe that the interests of an individual company and those of the wider community are fully aligned . \nThey aren t a truth too many regulators forgot in recent years . \nCorporate social responsibility sounds as unobjectionable as motherhood and apple pie and it would indeed be crazy to object to rich companies writing big checks for good causes . \nBut we shouldn t let that distract us from the fact that the chief social responsibility of business is to make a buck and the social responsibility of government is to be sure that perfectly proper corporate greed is channeled and constrained for the greater good of us all . \nthis is a comment about a different topic : your appearance this July -LRB- week of July 12 -RRB- on PBS , discussing the financial regulations passed by Congress . \nI really , really enjoyed your use of metaphor when you were being interviewed . \nHere are a couple of examples : if you want to use a traffic metaphor , what we have discovered in hindsight is that capital was moving too fast . \nThe speed limits were too high , and there were n't enough air bags , and there were n't enough seat belts in the system . \nThe goal , broadly speaking , of this legislation is to lower the speed limit of financial capital and to require all of us to wear seat belts . \nNow , the good news is , I think the legislation succeeds in doing that , maybe not 100 percent , but to some extent . \nAnd that should mean that car crashes , you know , 100 car crashes are a little bit less likely in the future . \nAnd later in the show : when we look back at the financial crisis of 2008 , one of the conclusions we 're going to draw is , regulators forgot that their job was to be policemen . \nAnd they started to see themselves as farmers , if you were , of Wall Street . \nThey started to think that their job was to help financial services to grow . \nNow , that might be the job of other parts of government , but , surely , the job of regulators is to make sure these guys are not doing things which are too risky . \nIt is difficult for financial reporters to write this well , let alone speak this clearly . \nI can see why your rise has been so rapid . \nTony Blair should be CEO of BP ... as soon as they get this leak plugged . \n`` Making a buck '' is the same no matter how it is done . \nThe world where either of these are true may have once existed , but it does n't any longer . \nSocial responsibility is n't just PR glitz , it 's long-term solutions to long-term problems , and the companies which address these problems in the most sustainable ways will not only keep the world turning and getting better every day , but outlast and out-earn companies focused on short term profits . \nIf this is n't an alignment of shareholder 's interests and the interests of the global community , I do n't know what is . \nWhen it comes to social responsibility , individuals as well as organizations have to think long term . \nMoney is only one component of profit . \nIf the communities in which you do business begin to fail , then your business will by necessity , fail in those communities as well . \nWith that in mind , businesses and individuals must not engage in activity that is harmful to society . \nBut how do you know what 's `` harmful to society '' ? \nYou ca n't measure it with some kind of formula . \nTherefore the only way to do this is individually by obeying the primary law of `` love your neighbor as yourself '' . \nPeople with little or no understanding will scoff at this . \nBut more people are waking up to the undeniable truth of it . \nFollow the link below and decide for yourself . \nalrite ill admit jonares got alittle carried away with how important CSR is , but hes rite it is important for profit . \nCSR isnt done to the point wher it is a liability for the company , it is done to the point where the marketing benefit is optimized . \nFor an energy company this is alot , because almost all energy companys engage in CSR to promote ther use over substitutes . \nFor an oil company it is imperative to keep public opinion in favor or prolonged use of fossil fuels , as widespread efforts to reduce them will lead to oil companys operating in an elastic business , one they do not wish to be part of at all . \nI see what the authors trying to say , but your point on CSR being a serious liability rather than a long term beneficial inconvenience sounds off from the point of a marketing director who uses CSR to keep customers from finding alternatives . \nGreed , corporate or otherwise , is NOT acceptable . \nGreed is the very essence of egoism . \nEgoism is the desire to take all you can while thinking nothing of the other . \nEgoism ties us to animal behavior . \nTherefore greed is not good . \nIt is needed in order to show us the difference between receiving for ourselves and bringing benefit to others . \nIn the first instance -LRB- receiving for the self -RRB- there is a never ending quest for `` more '' . \nAnd it does n't matter how many `` values '' a person has to `` compromise '' in order to get what they want . \nEvery human being on earth behaves this way . \nBut that does n't mean it is acceptable or even healthy to remain that way . \nWe have to recognize our interdependence . \nUnless we wake up to this fact our problems will only get worse . \nTake a moment to look at a short video clip about the natural law of interdependence . \nYou will understand that greed is indeed not good . \nOf course you do n't Have To , check out the link . \nBut then again , if you want to look like you know what you 're talking about , you might want to know about the alternative to greed . \nThe world economies will get a balance when the fundamentals of a capitalism society are protected from manipulators : This simple equation could force a seeking balance . \ninvestment = investment + profit gambling = gaining or losing Allowing a combined effect of greed + fears mars the regular functioning of offer + demand easily can lead to catastrophes like that one in 2008 . \nEasy profit is so close to easy losses that leaders are failing to protect the functioning of society . \nThere is a lesson about advanced countries and societies . \nThey are not as intelligent and superior as they were assuming as they are leading on many catastrophes from economic , obesity , and even environmental ones . \nWhen a person shows a high IQ profile I look at the size of the belly to see if any advanced brain performance is employed on adopting a healthy lifestyle . \nDo those wise guys know what is important in life ? \nI am trying to figure out about the difference of dying old poor\\/unknown or rich\\/famous . \nPerhaps rich people die better and by using secrets accounts would have savings for eternal life . \nCheck the link in my last post . \nThere actually are answers to the global situation . \nIt just requires individual acceptance and responsibility . \nThe discussion in the US is out of focus and ill informed . \nLet me remind you of the following facts . \nBP is meetings it 's obligations , even though it did not itself cause the disaster . \nThe two American companies that were primarily responsible , TransOcean and Haliburton have cleverly kept media attention on BP . \nFortunately for the wildlife and fisherman of the Gulf of Mexico , BP is acting in an honorable fashion . \nCompare the action of BP with the American Company , Union Carbide , which caused the biggest environmental disaster on the Planet , when over 15000 people were killed at Bhopal in India . \nThe attitude of Americans in general & Obama in particular is causing intense irritation in the UK . \nIt is your insatiable demand for cheap oil and gas that has caused this disaster . \nI read this pretzel of an article and am having a hard time following your logic . \n`` the chief social responsibility of business is to make a buck '' , you say , in the best tone-deaf , last-century rabid capitalist meme . \n`` any of the business disasters of the past 24 months have been facilitated by the mini-industry of corporate social responsibility ... . '' \nREALLY ???? So capitalists are blaming social responsibility for BPs results this quarter ? \nWhy the heck are you bringing up Madison Avenue advetisers ... . \nthey just mix the koolaid ! \nHere is a suggestion : replace `` shareholders '' with `` stakeholders '' , read up on the triple bottom line , -LRB- social , environmental , and financial bottom lines -RRB- or TBL . \nYou may desperately want to turn a blind eye to the concept of companies needing to behave sustainably in order to survive , but IT S THE FUTURE !! Companies like BP do not have a chance in hell of being SUSTAINABLE in order to benefit its shareholders , period . \nThere is a point where capitalism turns into cannibalism , but I digress . \nYuck , I feel like I ve just been dipped into the Gulf of Mexico . \nThis is an interesting article , honest and hard-headed . \nThe CSR is a broader category of which `` green washing '' is a part . \nThe system called for , though is a cat and mouse game . \nAnd in the U.S. , where money is speech , the mouse owns the cat . \nI find myself agreeing and disagreeing with your post at the same time . \nI think the central problem is that the term CSR means different things to different people . \nTo BP , it meant a variety of things , and these definitions seemed to have shifted over time . \nLord Browne took an important stand on climate change , but the company s real financial commitment to alternative energy paled in comparison to its promotion of its Beyond Petroleum image . \nThat s not CSR , that s greenwash or propaganda to use an older term . \nBP also committed to greater public transparency about all aspects of its business , including its safety and environmental record . \nIt disclosed , for example , how many spills it caused each year , and how many gallons were spilled . \nMost of BP s peers will not disclose this information . \nThat commitment to transparency is also CSR . \nYour fear that CSR will distract business leaders from their central purpose is exaggerated . \nThere is absolutely no risk that public companies will ever forget to pursue profit . \nThat is a sure recipe for bankruptcy . \nMany companies , however , have forgotten their obligations to make money within the rules of the game to use Milton Friedman s phrase . \nIf a company can not make money without killing people and destroying the environment , it has no right to be in business . \nThe greater risk is that investors , consumers , communities , reporters , and business leaders will fail to take a hard enough look at a company s CSR efforts , and fail to see what s truly important . \nWorker health and safety and environmental compliance are core responsibilities all oil and gas companies owe to society . \nThe company s obligation to make money is constrained by its obligation to do so safely and responsibly . \nBefore the accident , BP was one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization . \nThat is sufficient evidence that most investors did not bother to examine BP s frightening safety record before choosing to buy its stock . \nI agree that corporate philanthropy is nice , but insufficient . \nThat is no reason to paint all CSR activities with the same brush . \nThere are many companies that take CSR quite seriously , working to embed these concepts into their core business operations . \nThere are many , many examples . \nThe fact that BP is not one of them does not mean that the whole concept is bankrupt . \nI also agree that CSR can never replace effective regulation . \nNo regulator , however , will ever be able to fully and effectively constrain the worlds public companies set loose without any internal ethical or moral guidelines except to make money . \nThis is particularly true for companies with global operations . \nThere is no single government with the power or the authority to regulate all operations by a multinational . \nIn the end , we need both effective regulation and strong CSR programs . \nWe also need more conscientious investors who are willing to demand more responsible behavior . \nCSR has become much more effective since the focus has moved from avoidance -LRB- of sin stocks -RRB- to shareowner activism . \nOf course it is the government 's job to channel the power of corporations and to ensure against externalizing costs . \nHowever , who do you think largely controls the government ? \nAs a lobbyist , I spent years writing California 's legislation . \nTypically bills were written or amended by the very industry lobbyists the legislation appeared to regulate . \nI came to the conclusion that we are n't likely to have governments that operate democratically until we have businesses and other institutions that are also more democratically governed . \nShareowners , for example , are charged with electing corporate directors but we ca n't even nominate directors without going through a very expensive proxy contest . \nEven proxy access would only give us the ability to nominate a token few . \nI agree with a recent report , `` Compensation Complicity : Mutual Fund Proxy Voting and the Overpaid American CEO , '' by AFSCME , The Corporate Library and Shareowners.org which analyzed mutual fund voting patterns . \nThe Report offers two action recommendations : 1 . \nRetail investors in mutual funds , should critically evaluate how their mutual funds vote . \nNew tools such as those available at Proxydemocracy.org make this task much easier . \n-LRB- For example , see their ranking of votes on : director elections , executive compensation , corporate governance , and corporate impact . \nPlease send them a donation to support their work . \nAnother excellent source of information is Jackie Cook s Fund Votes . -RRB- \nInvestors should consider shifting their investments from fund families whose voting practices and records are not responsible to fund families with more responsible practices and records , provided the fee and performance characteristics of the funds are comparable . \nIf more responsible fund families are not available for example , because the investor s investment is made through an employer-sponsored benefit plan with limited investment choices the investor should lobby for expanded choices . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPrior , she was U.S. managing editor of the Financial Times . \nBefore that , Freeland was deputy editor , Financial Times , in London , editor of the FT s Weekend edition , editor of FT.com , U.K. News editor , Moscow bureau chief and Eastern Europe correspondent . \nFrom 1999 to 2001 , Freeland served for two years as deputy editor of The Globe and Mail , Canada s national newspaper . \nFreeland began her career working as a stringer in Ukraine , writing for the FT , The Washington Post and The Economist . \nANY OPINIONS EXPRESSED HERE ARE THE AUTHOR S OWN . \n"}
{"id": "498", "time": "2010-07-19", "text": "HOUSTON\\/LONDON | Mon Jul 19 , 2010 6:37 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP Plc can extend a test on its capped Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico after determining that nearby seepage is not related to the test , a U.S. official said on Monday . \nThad Allen , the top U.S. oil spill official , said the energy company could continue for 24 more hours a pressure test at the well , which was capped last week . \nBP shares took a beating on Monday following news that engineers detected seepage on the ocean floor after the well was capped . \nThe stock recovered in New York after BP and Allen said scientists had determined the seepage was not related to the well . \n`` We do not believe that is associated with this particular ... test or the Macondo well , '' Allen told reporters , referring to the seepage detected about 3 km -LRB- 1.9 miles -RRB- from the well . \nBP 's New York shares dropped more than 6 percent as investors sold on fears the seepage could signal that the April 20 blowout of the well might have damaged it , causing oil or gas to leak out the sides or possibly breach the seabed . \nShares in New York recovered on the news the seepage was unrelated to the well , finishing down 3.64 percent . \nIn the test , which began on Thursday , officials are monitoring the pressure in the well to gauge whether it is structurally sound . \nAn intact well would help when a relief well intercepts and tries to plug the leak , but damage could complicate that effort . \nThe worst oil spill in U.S. history has caused an economic and environmental disaster in five states along the Gulf Coast , hurt President Barack Obama 's approval ratings and complicated traditionally close ties with Britain . \nBP said in a statement that it had spent $ 3.95 billion on efforts to tackle the well and clean up the millions of barrels of spilled oil . \nThe explosion that led to the spill and a three-month long effort to plug the leak and clean up the oil has hit BP 's finances . \nBP has started canvassing shareholders about a restructuring that could include a breakup of its businesses , the Sunday Times reported . \nBP talks to sell half its stake in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay oil field to Apache Corp , which stalled over the weekend , were back on , CNBC reported . \nAs part of a test of the well , BP choked off the flow a mile under the water 's surface with a cap on Thursday , marking the first time oil has not spewed since the April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers . \nThe company was extending the test in 24-hour intervals , pending U.S. government approval . \nThe latest extension lasts until Tuesday afternoon . \nBP hopes to keep the damaged well shut until a relief well intercepts it and kills the well by mid-August , BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production Doug Suttles , said on Sunday . \nBut Allen has said when the pressure test ends , BP would `` immediately '' move to begin siphoning oil again to a pair of oil-capture vessels and move to a larger four-vessel siphoning system as planned by the end of July . \nSuttles ' statement could indicate diverging views between BP and the U.S. government . \nYet BP has repeatedly said the final say of how BP proceeds lies with Allen . \nOn Monday Allen appeared to leave open the possibility of keeping the well capped and shut . \nHe said it was hard to say whether BP will return to that siphoning system . \nHe also said installation of BP 's oil-capture vessel system , designed to handle up to 80,000 barrels a day , could be delayed by a few days as seismic and acoustic sensor vessels scan the area for possible wellhead and seabed anomalies . \n`` We are negotiating how to trade off and prioritize long-term containment , '' Allen said . \nROLE OF BP IN LIBYA BOMBER DEAL The oil spill is likely to loom large when British Prime Minister David Cameron meets Obama in Washington this week . \nThe White House said the company 's role in the release of the Lockerbie bomber from a Scottish prison will also come up . \nBP has confirmed that it lobbied the UK government in late 2007 over a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya , but said it was not involved in talks on the release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , convicted of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight . \nThe British government said it had no plans to re-examine a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya , despite demands by U.S. lawmakers for an investigation . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton told senators who had demanded an investigation that the United States was urging Scottish and British authorities to review the circumstances leading to Megrahi 's release . \nCameron 's visit comes as U.S. lawmakers are considering a range of rules that could require tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . \nBP is also trying to figure out a possible restructuring of its business . \nThe Sunday Times said options included selling the group 's refineries and petrol stations , scaling back U.S. operations and ramping up in-house engineering instead of outsourcing . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe is no longer a commander in the Coast Guard . \nHe has had little or no experience with accidents like this in the past . \nHis positions , statements and opinions are , in my opinion , those of a unschooled private citizen . \nThe Coast Guard is part of the problem at this point . \nThey should be directing ship traffic -- not working with oil wells . \n@Impeach ... you do realize you 're a bit crazy , right ? \nIt would seem that rather then release more oil into the Gulf , that pressure could be relieved by attaching hoses to the cap and pumping the to ship on surface . \nHis idea to remove the cap cholke completely show his lack of knowledge and experience . \nITs not and all or none situation . \nSo reduce pressure by adding hoses to cap instead fo testing more and allowing pressure to build . \nThere is no good reason to allow pressure to build if it

'' \nThe explosion killed 11 workers and sank the rig . \nThe oil well , which the companies have been unable to cap , was gushing about 5,000 barrels of crude per day . \nThe rig was owned and operated by Zug , Switzerland-based Transocean Ltd RIGN . \nS. British oil major BP Plc -LRB- BP . \nL -RRB- hired Transocean to drill the well , and oilfield services companies Halliburton Co -LRB- HAL . \nN -RRB- and Cameron International Corp -LRB- CAM . \nN -RRB- were also doing work on the rig . \nBP Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward told Reuters on Friday the company will compensate all those affected by the oil spill . \n-LRB- IDn : nLDE63T1SP -RRB- Oil majors generally do not buy coverage for clean-up costs from spills , as it is too expensive or unavailable . \nThe other companies on the project do hold insurance , but Hall said potential liability could outstrip any policy payouts . \nTransocean said its insurance covers the total loss of the Deepwater Horizon and wreck removal . \nThe rig had an insured value of $ 560 million . \n-LRB- IDn : nN26150882 -RRB- . \nCameron International Corp -LRB- CAM . \nN -RRB- , which supplied the device that failed to prevent the well blow out said it had a $ 500 million policy for any claims . \n-LRB- ID : nWEN3872 -RRB- . \nThe global insurance industry is already estimating that property insurance losses will likely exceed $ 1 billion , while liability claims could dwarf that and take years to play out . \nPlaintiffs attorney have already targeted the companies with lawsuits seeking compensation for economic loss and loss of life or injury . \nBrent Coon , the Texas lawyer who spearheaded civil litigation against BP in the aftermath of the 2005 explosion at its Texas City , Texas refinery that killed 15 workers , said his firm is representing a worker who survived the explosion in a lawsuit against BP , Transocean Halliburton and Cameron . \nHis firm is seeking a temporary restraining order against the companies to mandate that they preserve all documents and e-mails related to the disaster in anticipation of drawn-out litigation . \nCoon 's client , Stephen Stone , 24 , of Katy , Texas , was asleep when the explosion happened and escaped on a lifeboat . \n`` It 's like being in a war , to be caught in those kind of infernos with people screaming and not knowing whether you 'll live or die , '' Coon said . \nAt least four lawsuits naming all or some of the companies have been filed in U.S. District Court in New Orleans , attorney Hall said . \nShrimpers in Louisiana and Alabama have filed class-action lawsuits against the companies claiming anticipated economic losses from the disaster . \n-LRB- ID : nN29134097 -RRB- . \nOilfield service company Halliburton Co -LRB- HAL . \nN -RRB- provided cementing on the well to stabilize its walls . \nBP also faces costs related to the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 -- enacted after the Exxon Mobil Corp -LRB- XOM . \nN -RRB- Valdez spill -- and the U.S. Clean Water Act . \nThe Valdez spill of 250,000 barrels of oil into the Prince William Sound in Alaska cost Exxon about nearly $ 4 billion in compensatory payments , cleanup payments , settlements and fines , according to the company 's web site . \nOil rig accidents bring a patchwork of regular insurance coverage , reinsurance , and self-insurance mechanisms , said Claire Wilkinson at the U.S. Insurance Information Institute , the industry 's trade group . \n`` The great unknown here will be the environmental pollution liability issue . \nThese kinds of events take many years to unfold , '' she said . \n`` You could draw a parallel with Exxon Valdez -- 20 years later , the final costs are still unknown . '' \nMunich Re -LRB- MUVGn . \nDE -RRB- , the world 's biggest reinsurer , has said it could pay up to $ 100 million for the accident , but warned that it is too early to calculate the toll . \nBermuda 's PartnerRe -LRB- PRE . \nN -RRB- expects to pay claims of up to $ 70 million . \nEven if losses exceed $ 1 billion , it does not appear to be an insurance industry-threatening event . \nThe closest comparison is the explosion of the Piper Alpha rig off the British coast in 1988 , killing 167 , which ended up costing insurers $ 3.6 billion in today 's dollars , according to Swiss Re . \nBy comparison , insurers put the price tag of the 2001 attack on New York 's World Trade Center at $ 23 billion in today 's dollars . \nHurricane Katrina , which ravaged the U.S. Gulf Coast , cost insurers $ 71 billion . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n`` B.

{"id": "525", "time": "2010-08-03", "text": "HOUSTON | Tue Aug 3 , 2010 7:37 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP pumped heavy drilling mud into its blown-out Gulf of Mexico well on Tuesday in a `` static kill '' operation it hopes will help permanently plug the world 's worst accidental marine oil spill . \nThe operation , aimed at subduing the still unstable deepwater gusher that was provisionally capped in mid-July , is part of a two-pronged strategy that seeks to finally seal the Macondo well later in August through a relief well . \nThe `` static kill '' will take between 33 and 61 hours . \n`` The aim of these procedures is to assist with the strategy to kill and isolate the well , and will complement the upcoming relief well operation , '' British-based BP said in a statement . \nKent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production , told reporters in a briefing that drilling of the first of two relief wells , seen as the definitive , permanent `` kill '' solution , could resume by Thursday . \nThe relief well should intercept the ruptured Macondo well shaft in mid-August , so that more mud , and cement can be injected to shut it down for good . \nThe full magnitude of the Gulf of Mexico spill , triggered in April by a deadly rig explosion at the BP-owned Macondo well , became apparent on Monday as government scientists released revised figures showing almost 5 million barrels of oil leaked before the well was temporarily capped on July 15 . \nThis made it the world 's largest accidental maritime release of oil , surpassing the 1979 Ixtoc well blowout in Mexico 's Bay of Campeche that gushed almost 3 million barrels . \nRetired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who oversees the U.S. oil spill response , said earlier that engineers had succeeded in halting a hydraulic leak found on Monday in the cap that could have hindered the `` static kill '' operation . \nAllen told reporters engineers were moving cautiously , initially pumping in only a small amount of mud , so as not to damage the fractured well and cause fresh leaks . \n`` This thing wo n't be truly sealed until those relief wells are done , '' Allen added . \nThe spill has unleashed an environmental and economic catastrophe on the Gulf Coast , disrupting the livelihoods of fishermen and tourism operators and triggering a barrage of damages lawsuits against BP . \nThe company has said it will pay all legitimate claims and clean up fouled beaches and marshes . \nBP PRESSED OVER INFORMATION DISCLOSURE The new leak estimates spelled further bad news for BP , which also faces an investigation by U.S. securities regulators into whether its employees profited illegally from the spill . \nThe revised flow numbers suggest the company had underestimated costs by at least $ 1 billion . \nBP had estimated the well had leaked some 4 million barrels of oil and that it would be fined $ 1,100 per barrel under the Clean Water Act . \nThe company faces fines of $ 4,300 per barrel if gross negligence is proven , but said it saw no need to change its provision as a result of the new estimate . \nBP shares initially fell around 1 percent in early London trading on Tuesday , but recovered to close up 0.62 percent . \nU.S.-traded BP stock is up roughly 48 percent from its 2010 closing low of $ 26.97 on June 25 . \nBut it is still 34 percent below its April pre-spill high above $ 60 . \n`` BP has fallen to a point where people are beginning to get their hands around how large this might be and as a result the uncertainty has started to leave the stock and people start buying it back , '' said Shawn Hackett , president at Hackett advisors in Boynton Beach , Florida . \nBut the British energy giant faced fresh accusations on Tuesday that it was seeking to restrict information . \nThe National Wildlife Federation released a letter from nine scientists and marine researchers concerned over reports that BP was requiring confidentiality clauses in research contracts with scientists , which would prevent them from releasing findings for three years . \n`` BP is mounting a PR campaign suggesting that the environmental damage of the spill is over when we know that they have dumped millions of gallons of toxic dispersants to sink the oil out of sight , turning the Gulf into a toxic chemistry experiment , '' said Jeremy Symons , senior vice president of the National Wildlife Federation . \nThe letter , sent to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and incoming BP CEO Robert Dudley , demanded full public disclosure of all scientific data related to the disaster . \nBP , which took a $ 32.2 billion charge related to the spill in its results last week , has said it will sell $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion of assets to pay for the disaster . \nOn Tuesday , it said it would sell its Colombian oil assets to a consortium of Canada 's Talisman Energy and Colombia 's state-run Ecopetrol for $ 1.9 billion . \nBP 's 10 percent partner in the well , Japan 's Mitsui , has yet to decide if it will shoulder any costs , helping the trading house to report a 79 percent jump in profits to 102.5 billion yen -LRB- $ 1.18 billion -RRB- . \nOther oilfield services and drilling companies are counting the costs of a U.S. drilling moratorium and permit delays . \nBut a top official at the U.S. Interior Department on Tuesday said he hoped the ban on deepwater oil drilling could be lifted `` significantly '' ahead of the current November 30 deadline . \nAnd Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is delaying action on energy legislation that would implement offshore drilling reforms until some time after Congress returns from its summer recess in mid September . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nQuit the reporting of every little item that you idiots deem `` news-worthy '' . \nLet the company be !! Let the experts figure things out and stop the stupid reporting of meaningless items . \nThe Government needs to stick to mending the econonmy and not metaling in business that is NON OF THEIR BUSINESS . \nThey can not even run themselves , how the hell can they manage anything else . \nAmazing , the above poster speaks of damage to BP while not even mentioning the citizens and environment of the Gulf Coast . \nThe citizens and environment did not cause this disaster but were damaged by the negligence of BP . \nI pay a lot of money in taxes for the privilege of having my government act in cases like this . \nBP is NOT THE VICTIM HERE !!!

'' \nLarge sections of the Gulf of Mexico were closed to fishing , hundreds of miles of shoreline were polluted and the coastal economy , including tourism and fisheries , was disrupted before the well was capped on July 15 after the worst offshore oil leak in U.S. history . \nThe commission also criticized the White House for blocking early worst case estimates of the oil spill , which it said may have affected how fast resources were assembled to fight it . \nThe panel said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- wanted to release some of its worst-case spill models on the accident in late April or early May . \nBut the White House Office of Management and Budget -LRB- OMB -RRB- blocked the move to make the information public . \nThe White House decision to block the estimates came as BP was being criticized for failing to provide accurate information on the amount of oil that was leaking . \nIn a joint statement , the directors of OMB and NOAA did not deny that NOAA 's early spill estimate was blocked . \nInstead , they said NOAA 's early analysis was incomplete because it did not take into account the measures to control the oil , like using floating booms , skimming the oil and burning it at sea . \nHowever , those measures would not have stopped the oil from spewing out of BP 's broken well . \nThe agency heads noted that other senior government officials told the public in early May what the worst-case flow rate could be . \nCommission staff said it established that the possibility of releasing the worst-case discharge figures was at least discussed at the government 's Unified Command level that oversaw efforts to plug the well and clean up the oil . \nThe panel said in the end government teams and independent scientists came up with the same approximate figure on the total amount of oil that spilled from the well -- roughly 5 million barrels of oil leaked , with 4.2 million barrels pouring into Gulf waters and the rest being recovered . \nHowever , commission staff questioned comments made by Carol Browner , the White House 's energy and climate change director , after the well was plugged that `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . '' \nThe panel said about 40 percent of the oil that spilled and was labeled as `` dissolved '' and `` dispersed '' was potentially being biodegraded , but was not `` gone . '' \n`` Dispersed or dissolved oil may still be present in the water , and even evaporated oil remains in the atmosphere for a short time , '' the commission said . \nThe panel also said the government went overboard in placing boom to stop the oil , especially in Louisiana , where directions went out to `` keep the parishes happy . '' \nAs a result boom was placed everywhere , including in passes where fast tidal currents made it ineffective , and in places where it was unlikely to encounter any oil . \nBoom was also put in environmentally sensitive areas such as marshes , where severe storms blew it onto delicate grasses and habitat . \n`` The boom wars never reached a resolution . \nIn many instances , responders knew that in deploying boom they were responding to the politics of the spill rather than the spill itself , '' the commission said . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tom Doggett ; Editing by Russell Blinch and David Storey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOtherwise it is aka The Propaganda Ministry , a dangerous path for any democracy to embark on . \nSo ... wait ... the `` most transparent White House in history '' , as they call themselves , wanted to keep information from people ? \nI wonder what else they kept from us ? \nOh , well the healthcare bill 's real effects for one I guess ...

'' \n-LRB- The U.S. spill -RRB- was a reality check , an awakening for Norwegians that accidents happen and that production in deepwater is dangerous , '' said Point Carbon 's Brochman . \nNorway 's energy policy remains friendly for industry , however , with the latest offshore licensing round announced in June including all 12 previously envisaged deepwater blocks . \nThe total number of blocks on offer was cut by just six to 94 following the spill , while Oslo 's halt on drilling in new deepwater areas is seen as largly symbolic . \n-LRB- ID : nLDE65M0VK -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe U.S. Justice Department also requested that the lawsuits be handled by a New Orleans federal court . \n`` The U.S. is not a party at present in the cases against corporate defendants , but we think we will be , '' Justice Department representative Steven Flynn told the panel . \nHe said New Orleans `` would provide the best access to all litigants . '' \nWhichever court , or courts , end up overseeing the cases could grapple with them for years . \nThe panel , formally known as the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation , will decide whether the cases belong under the umbrella of one court , or potentially several . \nBP asked that the cases be combined in Houston , the U.S. oil capital , as did an attorney for Cameron International Corp , manufacturer of the blowout preventer on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded on April 20 . \nBP pushed ahead with plans to sell assets in Vietnam , Colombia and Venezuela , as it scrambles to hive off $ 30 billion of assets to pay for the cleanup . \nBankers said many of the most likely bidders are already part owners of the assets BP wants to sell , and this could help speed up the sales . \nIncoming Chief Executive Bob Dudley said on Wednesday BP would stay involved with the cleanup long after the well was finally plugged , which he said could happen next week . \nAlthough the flow of oil has been stopped , experts say the clean-up operation will take months . \nThe major oil slicks appear to have dispersed and experts are analyzing the extent of pollution in the sea . \nAn area of nearly 60,000 square miles -LRB- 150,000 sq km -RRB- of Gulf of Mexico waters is closed to fishing and more than 600 miles of coastline in four U.S. states is affected by oil , according to the latest U.S. government reports . \nEnvironmentalists have said it could be years before some Gulf beaches are declared free of toxic pollutants . \nShares of BP -- which has lost about 40 percent of its market value since the blast -- closed 2 percent higher in New York on Thursday . \nIts London shares closed up 2.7 percent . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nthat would bode well for BP stock As usual , the parasites -LRB- lawyers -RRB- are the only true winners in this case . \nThe gov. should put in place a court that looks at the merits of each case -LRB- most will be groundless i suspect , else they will have gone via the claims process -RRB- , and limit the compensation lawyers get from this . \nNo lawyer should be paid more than 10k no matter what happens if dudley can seal this in his first week , it will be down to the work done by the workers , who have been there all along . \nunless of course dudley is related to god , or has out of this world powers where just by the power of his thoughts he can seal this well . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe U.S. leader is under fire to push BP to permanently plug the leak and clean up an environmental and economic mess across five U.S. Gulf states . \nThe spill has cut into multi-billion dollar fishing , tourism and drilling industries . \nThe offshore spill , the worst in U.S. history , has spewed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf . \nSeveral previous attempts to plug the leak did not work , and investors remained cautious on BP 's latest effort . \nThe British energy giant 's shares , which fell about 50 percent in the first two months of the crisis but have gained 40 percent since late June , fell nearly 5 percent as part of a broader sell-off on the New York Stock Exchange . \nThey inched higher in London . \nBP began pressure tests on the well Thursday afternoon and expected them to last up to 48 hours . \nIt then aims to siphon up to 80,000 barrels of oil a day using a seal installed earlier this week and send it a mile up to waiting ships . \nEstimates had put the spill rate at between 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- a day . \nThe tests will show whether the cap is strong enough to contain the oil if the ships must disconnect from the well during a hurricane or other emergency . \nBP still expects to complete drilling a new well by early August to intersect the ruptured well and seal it with mud and cement . \nThe capping of the well came nearly three months after an oil rig explosion ruptured the well and killed 11 men . \nBut some residents in battered coastal communities remained skeptical . \n`` This is only the second day . \nI am not celebrating anything yet , '' Cindy Nelson of Biloxi said . \nUnder pressure from Obama , BP has established a $ 20-billion fund to cover the costs of the spill . \nThree analysts surveyed by Reuters Insider television forecast the company will pay between $ 63 billion to $ 100 billion over the next 15 years in fines and cleanup and legal costs . \nPeter Hutton , an analyst at NCB Securities in London , pegged the total cost at $ 40 billion . \n`` It 's relief all around to see that -LRB- undersea -RRB- camera with no oil coming out , '' said Hutton . \n`` But people recognize that they 're not completely out of the woods .

'' \nLooking at those questions , Mississippi 's governor last week ordered economists , state tax officials , business leaders and marine experts to put aside current finance pressures and spend a year studying the ramifications of the April 20 catastrophe . \n`` We need a clear grasp on how this oil spill will impact the State of Mississippi and local communities for years to come , '' Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said . \nEven before the disaster , in the first three months of 2010 , the revenue of states in the Gulf region shrank , according to a report this week from the Rockefeller Institute of Government . \nWhile all 50 state governments across America had an overall 2.5 percent rise in revenues , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and Texas all showed declines in year-over-year comparisons . \nA scramble for revenue will remain feverish for the foreseeable future . \nThe Center for Budget and Policy Priorities last month forecast states face revenue shortfalls of $ 140 billion in the coming fiscal year . \nThe projected fiscal 2011 budget gaps for Gulf states total at least $ 11 billion , including ones for Florida of $ 4.7 billion , Texas of $ 4.6 billion , and Louisiana at $ 1 billion , according to the center . \nBeyond hiking taxes , lifting fees and cutting spending , some governments look to tax medical marijuana and sugared drinks . \nOthers such as Florida are clearing the way for more gambling or casinos , at least in part to raise revenue . \nIn Louisiana , the Gulf state most reliant on energy businesses , the economic costs of the federal moratorium on deepwater oil drilling , in place through November 30 , will be severe and long lasting , according to Eric Smith , associate director of Tulane University 's Energy Institute . \nSmith estimated the moratorium affects dozens of deepwater rigs that ordinarily employ as many as 10,000 crew making about $ 100,000 each annually , with most of those wages spent in Louisiana and nearby states . \nThe ripples from the moratorium may take the number of lost jobs in Louisiana to 24,000 , according to Michael Hecht , head of Greater New Orleans Inc , an economic development agency . \n`` The economic impact from the oil spill itself , however broad and long-lasting , will likely be dwarfed by the impact from the moratorium , '' Hecht this week told a presidential panel investigating the disaster . \nMany of the rigs , their high-paying jobs and supply requirements will move elsewhere , Smith said , and slow the region 's economy for years . \nOne big driller , Diamond Offshore Drilling , has already announced it is moving two of its five rigs in the Gulf to other regions . \nThe likelihood of tougher U.S. regulations after the BP disaster for Gulf offshore drilling may drive operators to send rigs to Brazil and other regions , Standard & Poor 's said . \n`` This is a case of the regulators not understanding the business they are regulating , '' Smith said . \n`` They do n't understand the contracts . \nThese things cost $ 500 million to $ 600 million to build . \nThey have to operate . '' \nIn west Florida 's Panhandle , an area with many tourist businesses , officials in Escambia County worry that property prices already hit by the prolonged U.S. housing market slump will fall further . \nThe county 's property last year was appraised a total 6 percent less than a year earlier at $ 27.6 billion . \nThat meant lower property tax revenue and a $ 24-million reduction in county spending . \nFlorida 's tourist-dependent coastal economies stand to lose as much as 39,000 jobs and $ 2.2 billion or more in business because of the BP oil spill , according to University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith . \n`` The idea that a great environmental disaster could become a great economic one is n't inconceivable , but neither is it a certainty , '' S&P said last week in a report that concluded state and local governments were so far managing the BP leak ably . \n"}

'' \nBP 's leaking well was capped two weeks ago after gushing up to 60,000 barrels per day into the Gulf , ruining fishing and tourism industries and polluting the shoreline with slimy goo . \nBP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said the company would take a hard look at itself in the aftermath of the spill : `` BP ... will be a different company going forward . '' \nThe White House said President Barack Obama spoke with Svanberg on Monday but declined to say what was discussed . \nDudley , who will be the first American to lead BP , was raised in Mississippi , a fact that seems to be working in his favor among some Gulf residents . \n`` I think people would be more comfortable with someone running BP -LRB- who -RRB- is from the Deep South , '' said Richard Angelico , a 66-year-old lifelong resident of Orleans Parish , Louisiana . \n`` Hayward was inept at public relations and speaking to people in southern Louisiana . '' \nDudley said on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' he expected no more oil to flow into the Gulf , but added : `` we 've got to really kill that well to be absolutely certain . '' \nBP could begin the final procedure to permanently plug the well late next week . \nSome investors and analysts say BP 's culture encourages greater risk-taking than rivals , contributing to higher returns . \nCritics have also blamed this culture for the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nDudley told a conference call with reporters that safety `` is going to be one of my highest priorities , in addition to the focus on making sure we meet our obligations around the Gulf Coast . '' \nThe spill looks likely to leave a legislative legacy . \nThe Senate may begin debating a slimmed-down energy bill as early as Thursday , and holding BP accountable for cleaning up the Gulf will be a priority . \nBP said it planned to sell assets worth up to $ 30 billion over the next 18 months to pay for its liabilities and create a leaner company with the potential for higher growth . \nInvestment bankers said the assets BP could sell include its stake in Alaska 's huge Prudhoe Bay oil field and its interest in Pan American Energy in Argentina , as well as smaller assets in Vietnam , Pakistan and Colombia . \nIndustry executives said it was a good time to sell assets as relative stability in the oil price in the past nine months makes it easier for buyers and sellers to agree to deal terms . \nBP agreed to a $ 7 billion sale of oil and gas fields to Apache Corp last week , which valued the assets at around $ 19.40 per barrel of oil equivalent . \nThe rest of BP trades at an implied $ 7\\/barrel , analysts at Morgan Stanley said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI did business with BP many years ago where my Company supplied them with pressure vessels and I found their practices unacceptable . \nI am surprised it has taken this long for them to get caught out . \nIt is a very sad day when a gust of hot wind -LRB- Obama -RRB- and his cronies -LRB- the American people -RRB- can influence business so much in such a distorted fashion . \nAs one commentator pointed out , Goldman Sachs deliberately polluted the world economy , being responsible for almost pulling down the entire system , yet they are only fined $ 550m -- after hearings and trials . \nYet BP pollutes 4 states in one country and is ` fined ' $ 20b -- before any justice is permitted . \nOnce again , the world bears witness to the arrogance of the US and unfortunately bears the brunt of its self centered attitude . \nHad this been a US company polluting the Greek or Australian\\/NZ coastlines it would be a completely different story . \nMay God help us from the Americans . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

^ ^ ^ -RRB- Below are details of the assets BP has agreed to sell , and those that analysts deem likely to be considered for sale or that have been reported to be for sale . \nU.S. OIL COMPANY APACHE -LRB- APA . \nN -RRB- TO BUY : BP said the deals with Apache were together worth about $ 7 billion . \nGas-producing assets valued at US$ 3.25 billion . \nNet output is 240 million cubic feet per day -LRB- cfpd -RRB- of gas and 6,500 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of liquids , with 214 million barrels oil equivalent -LRB- boe -RRB- of net proved reserves . \nAlso included is the proposed Mist Mountain coal bed methane project . \nValued at $ 3.1 billion , the assets include 10 fields , two BP-operated gas processing plants and non-operated interests in the Terrell gas processing facility . \nNet production is about 15,100 bpd of liquids and 80 million cfpd of gas , with net proved reserves of 126 million boe . \nValued at $ 650 million . \nNet production of assets being sold is 6,016 bpd of oil and 11 million cfpd of gas , with about 20 million boe of net proved reserves . \nSale includes East Badr El-din concession where BP has an exploration licence with a 100 percent interest , and BP 's interests in the Western Desert business concessions . \nA BP spokesman said the company was `` exploring divestment options '' for its interest in the Nam Con Son gas project , which the London-based company says is one of Vietnam 's largest foreign investment projects . \nBP 's share of production is 63 million cubic feet per day -- less than 1 percent of total oil and gas output . \nThe stake is worth $ 966 million , analysts at UBS said in a research note on Monday . \nBP also plans to sell its upstream assets in Pakistan , which comprise a number of producing fields and exploration blocks in the southern Sindh province . \nThe Pakistan fields produced 173 million cubic feet of gas per day in 2009 net to BP and are worth $ 690 million , UBS estimated . \nBP had been in talks with potential buyers , including Apache , for its 26 percent stake in the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska , the largest oil field in North America , sources familiar with the matter said . \nThe field 's production has declined but at 69,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- in 2009 , it still contributed over a third of BP 's total output from Alaska 's North Slope . \nBP 's total Alaskan assets are estimated to be worth about $ 12 billion , UBS said . \nBP 's delicate balance of power with its partners in Russian joint venture TNK-BP TNBPI . \nRTS means it can not reduce its 50 percent stake without jeopardising its bargaining strength and analysts do not expect an outright sale . \nThe company also holds a stake of about 1 percent in Rosneft -LRB- ROSN . \nSome analysts see this as a potential disposal candidate but a sale would force the company to take a hefty loss as the shares have fallen significantly since BP bought them in Rosneft 's flotation . \nBP holds a 60 percent stake in Pan American Energy -LRB- PAE -RRB- , which owns Cerro Dragon , one of the largest shallow oil and gas fields in southern Argentina . \nOnce deemed near the end of its life , it now sets new output records , at about 80,000 bpd of oil -- 80 percent of PAE output -- and 130 million cubic feet of gas a day . \nReserves are 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent . \nBP 's stake in Pan American is estimated to be worth $ 9 billion . \nThe Cusiana and Cupiagua fields , discovered by BP in the early 1990s , saw production peak in 1999 , achieving an average rate of 434,000 bpd . \nWhen BP handed over operation of Cupiagua at the start of July to state oil company Ecopetrol SA , while continuing to operate Cusiana , Cupiagua output was 26,000 bpd . \nThe Colombian assets are estimated to be worth $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion . \nBP has minority stakes in two exploration and production joint ventures with state-owned PDVSA and is a partner in the Petromonagas crude upgrader that produces 110,000 bpd , with gross reserves of 1.2 billion barrels boe . \nThe Venezuelan assets are estimated to be worth $ 850 million to $ 1 billion . \nREFINERIES , TANKS AND RETAIL STATIONS Reports have suggested BP could spin off its refineries and retail stations but industry sources said this was unlikely and BP said it was focussed on selling upstream assets . \nBP has whittled down its portfolio of refineries in recent years to a core of high-grade facilities integrated into broader operations such as trading and upstream production . \nThe company has also already sold out of many retail operations , including the U.S. market . \nBP reached an agreement earlier in July to sell the 7.8 million barrels of crude oil storage in Cushing , Oklahoma , and petroleum pipelines to Magellan Midstream Partners , L.P. for $ 289 million . \nCushing is the delivery point of U.S. crude , or West Texas Intermediate . \nBP said the agreement was part of the ongoing intent announced in the fourth quarter of 2009 to divest non-strategic pipelines and terminals in the U.S. Mid-West , Gulf Coast and West Coast during 2010 and 2011 . \nBP reached an agreement in June to sell fuels and convenience retail business in France to Delek Europe B.V. for 180 million euros , about $ 251 million . \nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2010 , subject to regulatory approvals . \nBP intends to sell its marketing business in Namibia , Malawi , Tanzania and Botswana and focus on South Africa and Mozambique . \nIn April BP completed the sale of its 35 percent interest in K-Power , a gas fired power asset in Gwangyang , South Korea , to SK Holdings Co Ltd for $ 316 million . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin and Ikuko Kurahone in London and Braden Reddall in

'' \nHowever , David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan Law School professor and a former federal prosecutor said the lawsuit was a bad omen for BP . \n`` I would say the Justice Department was making a statement with the filing of yesterday 's complaint about the fact that they intend to be aggressive in holding BP and the other companies involved accountable for the Gulf oil spill , '' he said . \n`` It makes everything considerably more complicated for BP , '' added David Logan , Dean at the Roger Williams University School of Law . \nThe mainly UK-based analyst community that covers BP has often struggled to estimate U.S. legal costs and penalties . \nAfter a fatal blast at BP 's Texas City refinery in 2005 that killed 15 workers , analysts predicted the disaster would cost BP $ 300 million to $ 400 million . \nBy 2008 , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least . \nThe government 's lawsuit also seeks damages from BP 's partners in the well , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co Ltd unit MOEX , well driller Transocean Ltd and its insurer QBE Underwriting\\/Lloyd 's Syndicate 1036 . \nShares in Swiss-based Transocean , the world 's largest offshore rig contractor , dropped 4.4 percent on Thursday . \nAnadarko 's shares -LRB- APC . \nN -RRB- were down 1.6 percent . \nAnalysts said the inclusion of insurer QBE in the lawsuit alongside BP and other oil companies demonstrated that the U.S. government was casting its net as widely as possible as it seeks to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill . \n`` They 're just throwing these things at everybody . \nIt 's the dartboard approach , '' said one London-based insurance analyst . \nAdding to the negative press on BP 's safety record , leaked U.S. diplomatic cables reveal BP suffered a blowout on an Azerbaijan gas platform in September 2008 and was fortunate to evacuate workers safely , Britain 's Guardian newspaper reported . \n"}
{"id": "316", "time": "2010-09-03", "text": "HOUSTON | Fri Sep 3 , 2010 4:22 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc removed a failed blowout preventer from atop its ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well on Friday afternoon , a company spokesman said . \n`` The Deepwater Horizon BOP stack was successfully detached '' from the Macondo well shortly after 1 p.m. CDT -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB- , spokesman Daren Beaudo said . \n`` There is no oil coming from it , '' he said of the well . \nOne of several live feeds of the procedure from underwater robots showed a cloudy brown substance coming from the well . \nBeaudo said the `` trailing brownish material '' was residual drilling mud pumped into the well in earlier operations . \nA blowout preventer is intended to shut off a well if oil or gas uncontrollably rushes to the top . \nIt failed to do so in the case of the Macondo well . \nBP will replace the 50-foot -LRB- 15-m -RRB- stack of valves and pipes with a working blowout preventer and then resume drilling a relief well to plug the leak for good , the company said . \nRetired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the spill response , said officials are monitoring the slow lifting process . \n`` We will continue to closely monitor progress as the BOP , which along with the latching device weighs approximately 1 million pounds , is lifted to the surface in the next 24-36 hours , '' Allen said in a statement . \nThe company said earlier on Friday that , weather permitting , BP expects the relief well to intersect the Macondo well near its bottom about 13,000 feet beneath the seabed in mid-September . \nBP will then pump mud and cement into the well to ensure the leak is dead , the company said . \nBP and government officials did not expect oil to leak from the well once the failed blowout preventer was lifted off . \nThe company pumped cement into the well from the top on August 5 , which officials believe sealed off the well from the reservoir . \nThe failed blowout preventer is critical evidence in various investigations into the April 20 blowout that led to an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 men . \nOfficials removed it before finishing the relief well to preserve its value as evidence and ensure a working blowout preventer was on the well to handle any pressure increases when drilling resumes . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI could see none -- could you ?

\n-- that pipe should NOW be fished out and Cement Bond Logs run to check the lower annulus and the bottom of the well viewed before any opening in the annulus is made . \nYou would not let BP do major surgery on your brain before running some scans and tests . \nAllen and BP would be total fools not to do expensive `` diagnostic tests '' before opening the annulus -LRB- not knowing what their surgery might find -RRB- . \nI sure do n't want anyone experimenting on me and operating on me without knowing what is available to study -- and the results of that study . \nSuppose they fish out this fallen drill pipe and the logs show perfect cement bonding outside the lower casing in the annulus . \nThe entire purpose of the Relief Well is to seal the annulus to prevent hydrocarbons from the Monster Zone below . \nThere would be 5000 feet of rock hard cement in the lower casing that is impossible to leak by and only the annulus could possibly leak something . \nIf they find that annulus cement on the diagnostic test to be perfectly sealed the well is perfectly declared sealed and must be declared forever dead . \nWhy use any experimental surgery to do what already is cured . \nHowever if they find weak cement or any place in the lower annulus near the 5000 foot plug in the bottom of the casing , then it must be sealed . \nAt that point there are two possible ways to repair the annulus . \nRun large tubing with a packer on it so nothing can pass it coming up the casing once it is set -- and set the packer . \nThen have Haliburton use a wire line through the tubing and through the packer to the spot the diagnostic tests show cement is needed and perforate holes through the pipe into the annulus . \nThe packer protects against anything coming up the casing that might come in from the annulus holes . \nThen pump a `` cement squeeze job '' into the annulus to repair it -- totally protected by the packer with tubing up to the ship . \nThis is all standard procedure tested by many many years of O&G experience . \nThe let the cement set . \nRemove the packer and re-log the well to prove it is Killed Forever . \nShow the logs to Allen and let Haliburton engineers explain this to him and his so called science team . \nThen officially declare the well -- Killed Twice -- and forever DEAD . \nFinish the Relief well and run the risk of the identical problem of a liquified methane rising and forming a bubble as it turns to gas and flow over the top of the relief well to re-create this whole mess . \nSuppose that does not happen and they only open up the annulus to blow out up the annulus where there is no pipe -- creating a blow out impossible to repair . \nSuppose any one of a miriad of other accidents happen . \nDudley admits this is a rate thing to experiment with a Relief Well at this 18,000 foot Depth below 5000 foot of sea water and thinks it should be done to learn about what can be done and whatever new dangers lurk . \nHe seems to think it is a great experiment . \nAllen wants it because early on he stated that the relief well will be used for the final KILL . \nHis science team seems to go along with BP . \nis the standard very very safe way to kill this well twice . \nJust abandon 2 . -RRB- \nand plug the relief well . \nSep 03 , 2010 9:13 pm EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "338", "time": "2010-11-08", "text": "WASHINGTON | Mon Nov 8 , 2010 6:39 pm EST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The White House oil spill commission said on Monday it found no evidence to support accusations that the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history happened because workers for BP Plc and its partners cut corners to save money , mostly blaming the accident on a series of on-site misjudgments . \n`` To date we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety , '' the commission 's Chief Counsel Fred Bartlit said at a meeting exploring the causes of the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nBartlit said the panel agreed with about 90 percent of the findings of BP 's internal investigation of the accident released this summer . \nBP 's report assigned much of the blame for the accident to its drilling partners . \nBartlit also said BP 's well design was not inherently faulty , although it did have some impact on the drilling project 's operations . \nWhile the commission has no legal authority to carry out policies or punishment , the findings could help BP 's tarnished reputation , although the panel was still very critical of BP 's procedures to plug the well prior to the explosion , saying the oil giant took unnecessary risks . \nSome lawmakers and critics have accused BP and other companies involved in drilling the well of sacrificing safety for monetary savings in the run-up to the rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf over the summer . \n`` What is fully evident , from BP 's pipeline spill in Alaska and the Texas city refinery disaster , to the Deepwater Horizon well failure , is that BP has a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits , '' U.S. Representative Edward Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts , said in a statement . \nBartlit said the commission 's preliminary investigation found no evidence that individual workers took safety risks to save money , and that it instead found that a series of factors ultimately contributed to the explosion . \nStill , Bartlit emphasized that his probe did not focus on company culture and not everything done on the rig was safe . \nWorkers for BP and Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , also misread a critical negative pressure test of cement used in an attempt to plug the well . \nThe panel 's investigators said workers may have misinterpreted the test because neither of the companies nor the government had standard procedures for handling negative pressure tests . \nThere is disagreement over whether Transocean had any responsibility for overseeing the negative pressure test . \n`` Industry standard is that the operator , BP , interprets the test , '' Bill Ambrose , director of special projects for Transocean , told the panel . \n`` Our personnel do not have the experience or authority to interpret the negative test . '' \nBartlit released a stinging report last month that said Halliburton Co used flawed cement in BP 's doomed well . \nCommission co-chair Bill Reilly , former head of the Environmental Protection Agency , said the initial findings seem to point to human mistakes as the primary cause of the accident . \nWhile the panel will consider the need for better monitoring of rig data and more standards for negative pressure tests , Reilly said `` it was very difficult ... to see what we could recommend be required that would have avoided the decisions that were made . '' \n`` However , it 's very difficult for me to conclude that there was not a culture of complacency affecting everything involved with this exercise , '' Reilly said . \nOn Monday , Halliburton 's shares were up 4.7 pct , while Transocean 's shares were up 4.8 pct . \nBP was off 1.3 percent . \nAnadarko Petroleum Corp , 25 percent owner of the Macondo well , was down 4.3 percent . \nOffshore drilling analyst Longdley Zephirin , of the Zephirin Group , said the offshore drilling industry , and especially Transocean and the service companies came off well after the first day of proceedings . \n`` We believe the hearing shines a positive light in the sector , as it exhibits the importance of safety versus saving money , '' he said . \nAs he presented the commission 's preliminary findings , Bartlit stressed the probe was not focused on legal liability or assigning blame . \nBP has accused Halliburton of using an unstable cement design and said Transocean failed to test the automatic shut-off function on the blowout preventer before it was used on the rig . \nTransocean has denied those charges and said BP 's well design was a key factor in the accident . \nHalliburton has also defended its cement work on the well , and blamed other actions for causing the explosion . \nIt will be difficult to work out the discrepancies between the companies without the legal power to compel testimony from company representatives under oath , Bartlit said . \n`` I ca n't subpoena people . \nI wish I could , '' Bartlit said . \n`` I think it 's damn important . '' \nAlthough a measure providing the panel with subpoena power passed the House of Representatives earlier this year , the measure was held up by partisan gridlock in the Senate . \nPresident Barack Obama created the seven-member commission in the aftermath of the drilling accident . \nIts ultimate charge is to develop proposals to prevent and respond to major spills in the future . \n-LRB- Editing by David Gregorio , Jim Marshall and Sofina Mirza-Reid -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe lawyers are pushing the economy of the littoral towards catastrophe , along with hysterical environmentalists . \nGet those stock prices up at all costs ! \nNov 08 , 2010 5:22 pm EST -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

well deep under the Gulf of Mexico after a setback with a huge undersea containment dome fueled fears of a prolonged and growing environmental disaster . \nThe spill is spreading west , further from Florida but toward the important shipping channels and rich seafood areas of the Louisiana shoreline , where fishing , shrimping and oyster harvesting bans have been widened . \nA state of emergency

surface was complicating the challenge . \n`` We 're actually dealing with a source that does n't have human access , '' Allen said . \nAt least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing unchecked into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , rupturing the well and killing 11 crew members . \nOn Dauphin Island , Alabama , a barrier island and beach resort , sunbathers found tar balls along a short stretch of beach . \nExperts were testing the tar to determine if it came from the Gulf spill . \nThe spill , which could become the worst in U.S. history , threatens economic and ecological disaster on Gulf Coast tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds . \nIt has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . \nThe disaster could slow the exploration and development of offshore oil projects worldwide , the head of the International Energy Agency warned . \n`` The future potential is offshore in deeper water and in the Arctic , so if offshore investment is going to be slowed down , that is a concern , '' IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told London 's Sunday Telegraph it could be weeks or months before the spill is brought under control . \nHe said the company could spend $ 10 million a day on clean-up efforts . \nBP may next try to plug the damaged blowout preventer on the underwater well by pumping debris into it at high pressure , a technique called a `` junk shot , '' or attaching a new preventer on top of it . \n`` They are actually going to take a bunch of debris -- some shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that -- and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up to stop the leak , '' Allen told CBS News . \nBP also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak but that could take three months . \nHundreds of boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the oil again on Sunday . \nCrews have laid more than 900,000 feet of boom and spread 290,000 gallons -LRB- 1.1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . \nLatest government forecasts show possible effects of the spill moving further west , toward Texas . \n`` With continued winds from the east , potential oil contacts could reach as far west as Point Au Fer Island by Wednesday , '' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said . \nSheen is about eight miles off the coast of Port Fourchon , with heavy oil still some 28 miles offshore , said Charlotte Randolph , president of Lafourche Parish . \n`` We 're keeping a very close watch , deploying boom and closing some beaches , '' she said . \nTruckloads of sand are being delivered to Port Fourchon to fill large sandbags , which will be dropped by National Guard helicopters in five areas along the coast . \nChett Chiasson , executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission , said access to the port is a major concern . \n`` If necessary , our current strategy is to place boom along Belle Pass in Bayou Lafourche to create a ` decontamination station ' for ingress and egress through the port , '' he said . \nIn Alabama , BP-contracted workers in rubber boots and gloves laid down clusters of oil-absorbing synthetic fibers called pom-poms , erected storm fencing along the Dauphin Island beach and collected samples of the tar and water for testing . \nGary Bratt , owner of Chaise N ' Rays Rentals , which rents recreational equipment on Dauphin Island , said the threat of the spill reaching shore was ruining his business . \n`` Our business is off 70 percent at this point , '' with potential vacationers canceling `` right and left , '' he said . \nGulf Coast politicians echoed the public 's fears . \n`` If this gusher continues for several months , it 's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it 's going to get down into the Loop Current and that 's going to take it down into the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida , '' Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson told CNN . \n`` You 're talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training which is in the Gulf of Mexico . '' \nCrews labored to cordon off the entrance to Alabama 's Mobile Bay with a containment boom fence to try to safeguard America 's ninth-largest seaport . \nShips arriving at Southwest Pass , the deepwater entrance to the Mississippi River and New Orleans will be inspected to determine if they need cleaning . \nThe spill 's only major contact with the shoreline so far has been in the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , mostly a wildlife reserve . \nThe next few days threatens wider contact . \nLouisiana officials closed more waters to fishing and shrimp and oyster harvesting as the slick edged westward . \nShrimp harvesting is now banned from Freshwater Bayou on the central coast to Louisiana 's border with Mississippi . \nSome oyster beds west of the Mississippi River also are shut . \nSeafood is a $ 2.4 billion industry in Louisiana , which produces more than 30 percent of the seafood originating in the continental United States . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOil sands can provide clean and enviromentally friendly oil to the world for over a hundred years . \nThis without bringing the hurt and pain to a region that does n't deserve this . \nIt 's unfortunate that this needed to happen for the world to wake up . \nThis disaster is a big deal . \nIt will kill the south eastern gulf coast . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "397", "time": "2010-06-11", "text": "The catastrophic blowout at Macondo has sliced 40 percent off BP 's market capitalization , and led analysts to speculate about lasting reductions in deepwater drilling and the resulting impact on both long-term oil supply and the fate of climate change legislation . \nThe underlying fear is that Macondo is the oil industry 's Three Mile Island , an accident that turned public opinion against nuclear power for three decades . \nInvestors are right to fear the long-term impact on the company . \nBut they exaggerate the impact on the wider industry and the prospects for climate change legislation . \nBP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . \nDeepwater and ultra-deepwater petroleum wells are just one of a suite of advanced technologies energy producers have been using to extend the peak in conventional oil production . \nIn its 2008 World Energy Outlook , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- estimated worldwide deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves at 200 billion barrels . \nEven complete loss of deepwater and ultra-deepwater oil production would have only a marginal impact on total energy supply in the decades to come . \nIn any event , it seems unlikely deepwater exploration and production will be abandoned . \nMost policymakers recognize there is no practical alternative . \nLukewarm public support for climate change legislation shows how little appetite there is for measures significantly increasing the cost of fossil fuels or forcing reductions in energy consumption . \nThe industry actually has a good track record of operating in extremely challenging environments at huge depths and under massive pressures with few accidents . \nOne reason Macondo has stirred such intense passions is because it is so unusual . \nThe public , regulators and the industry itself have become used to the miracle of pulling oil up from deep below the surface without any real understanding of the engineering challenges involved . \nIt has bred complacency . \nDeepwater drilling will continue , probably under a tougher permitting and inspection regime , with additional fail-safe and disaster-recovery systems , adding to the industry 's costs . \nBut higher safety and compliance costs will not materially affect oil prices going forward . \nExtra compliance might add $ 2-3 to the price of a barrel of deepwater oil , but this is inconsequential compared with the vast expense of conducting seismic surveys under miles of seawater , mud and salt ; rig hire ; and the exploration risks of drilling dry wells . \nAnyway , oil prices are set at the margin by the highest-cost form of production , and deepwater and ultra-deepwater are not the marginal source of supply . \nOther technologies such as tar sands , shale oil , and in the medium-term gas-to-liquids -LRB- GTL -RRB- and coal-to-liquids -LRB- CTL -RRB- are all more expensive and will set prices , not deepwater . \nIf it does happen , slower development of deepwater resources would have its biggest impact in the three-six year timeframe , when other technologies are still relatively immature and unable to fill the gap . \nFor the moment , however , oil resources look comfortable in the medium term . \nThe banking crisis and worldwide recession in 2007-09 have shifted the global economy onto a lower and slower growth trajectory , freeing up energy resources and improving the medium-term supply-demand outlook . \nMacondo would have had an enormous impact if it had occurred in H1 2008 . \nIn the current environment , with spare capacity , the industry can absorb the potential loss of supply more easily . \nBILL STILL ON ROAD TO NOWHERE In the near term , Macondo complicates the passage of climate change legislation pending before the U.S. Senate . \nBut the impact should not be exaggerated . \nThe bill 's prospects were already poor and it has been heavily watered down . \nThe emerging deal would have seen the Obama administration and congressional Democrats open up more offshore areas to drilling in exchange for at least some Republican and energy industry support for the modified cap-and-trade provisions set out in Senator John Kerry 's re-named American Power Act . \nThat deal looks an increasingly hard sell , one reason President Barack Obama and senior officials are furious with BP . \nEven before the spill , however , it was far from clear the drilling-for-climate deal would secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to move forward . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- Despite revisions to cap-and-trade , delaying its introduction for manufacturers and promising greater offshore acreage , there has been no lessening of hostility from Senate Republicans . \nThe only Republican to support the compromise initially , South Carolina 's Senator Lindsey Graham , had already dropped his sponsorship under pressure from the party leadership and conservative activists . \n-LRB- 2 -RRB- Coastal Democrats were more or less united in their hostility to more offshore drilling well before Macondo . \nTen coastal-state Democratic senators wrote to Kerry in March to oppose putting drilling into the climate and energy bill . \nThey included Bill Nelson -LRB- Florida -RRB- , Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg -LRB- New Jersey -RRB- , Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed -LRB- Rhode Island -RRB- , Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin -LRB- Maryland -RRB- , Ted Kaufman -LRB- Delaware -RRB- , and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley -LRB- Oregon -RRB- . \n`` While technological advances have attempted to lower the environmental and economic risks of drilling , experience has shown that no technology is foolproof ... Far from being a thing of the past , spills occur with alarming frequency '' , they wrote , with what now seems like horrible prescience . \nWith industrial and coal-state Democrats opposed to raising the burden on manufacturers and coal-producers , coastal Democrats opposed to drilling , and Republicans leery of a potentially unpopular compromise , the climate bill has a mountain to climb , and is running out of time before the mid-term elections . \nUNLUCKY BP SET FOR BIG CHANGE While Macondo will not have much impact on the wider industry , the effect on BP itself could be far more severe . \nSince the problems with Exxon Valdez -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Brent Spar -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , BP 's rivals Exxon and Shell have largely avoided major accidents . \nBoth were searing experiences , prompting an overhaul of internal controls and safety culture . \nIn contrast , BP 's North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals -- including the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . \n-LRB- 2006 -RRB- BP pleaded guilty to felony charges in the Texas City case , and was sentenced to $ 50 million fine and three-years probation . \nAs BP American Chairman Bob Malone accepted at the time `` If our approach to process safety and risk management had been more disciplined and comprehensive , this tragedy could have been prevented '' . \nBP also received a fine and probation for Alaska . \nThe company has also paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 303 million for attempting to manipulate the propane market -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . \nThe settlement beguilingly concluded `` all criminal investigations of BP America on matters related to propane , gasoline , crude oil and other commodity trading '' , implying the CFTC was looking at other issues as well . \nThe incidents may or may not reflect shortcomings in management and culture . \nMaybe the company has just been unlucky . \nBut the number of them in quick succession is beginning to look disturbing . \nRightly or wrongly , BP North America is being singled out by U.S. officials as a problematic part of the industry . \nDeepwater drilling will undoubtedly resume , under a tougher inspection regime . \nBut BP may cede ground to its less accident-prone peers and will come under fierce pressure to change its operating and management practices . \nIt is that fear markets are reflecting with the collapse in the share price . \nThe direct costs of the clean up are only one of the company 's problems . \nBP 's number one priority now is to make sure that the next time a well blows , it belongs to someone else . \nThere are similarities as well as differences between Deepwater Horizon and Three Mile Island . \nThe similarities involve the powers that be lying after the fact to downplay the extent of their respective disasters and the enormity of ensuing long-term effects , which would lead one to conclude that similarly casual -LRB- when it comes to the lives of others -RRB- individuals are in charge of both situations at corporate and government levels . \nThe difference is that the noxiousness of the escaping carcinogens from Three Mile Island and the inevitability of more such incidents led correctly to a moratorium on nuclear power plants in the United States , whereas in the case of Deepwater Horizon all that is really necessary once the incredible mess has been cleared up is that attainable safety standards and procedures are never again bypassed . \nIn both cases , it is unlikely that those responsible will ever remunerate in full those whom they 've harmed because a -RRB- the culpable executives are stingy , unprincipled scoundrels who tend to litigate rather than act decently ; and b -RRB- because in the case of Three Mile Island , the damage will continue for more than a million years , and is thus difficult to fully assess . \nNot so in BP 's case . \nOr rather , not necessarily so -- a lot here depends on BP . \nTOTAL MEDIA BLACKOUT ON GULF OIL SPILL and FAA Closes Airspace over the Gulf Well , obviously the journalists fear for their jobs too ! \nBecause otherwise they 'd write the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ! \nInstead of which , the mainstream media continues to downplay the size of this catastrophe and assume that the general public are gullible idiots . \nThis is now several steps too far but never fear , the Truth always outs in the end and heads will roll ! \nHOW much oil is under the Gulf ? \nNo , it 's not Three Mile Island . \nIt 's Chernobyl -- considering the scale of environmental catastrophe . \nJust remember Reuters is the company that once had a writer refeer to OPAC a proven funder of terriost , as a CLUB . \nSaudi costs for producing oil are the lowest in the world : according to Ali Al-Naimi , -LRB- Saudi oil minister -RRB- the cost to produce one barrel is less than $ 2 . \n-LRB- a direct quote -RRB- Saudi Arabia reportedly -LRB- ?? -RRB- needs to sell oil for at least $ 55 dollars a barrel to cover the cost of running the country . \nFossil fuels finance 75 percent of the country 's entire domestic spending budget . \nFor the above references click article -LRB- Bottom pg 2 , top pg 3 -RRB- Question : does this include the hundreds of Millions , even Billions of dollars dispersed yearly to the Thousands of Saudi princes to finance their Preposterous , Extravert lifestyles ??? Not to mention the Millions -LRB- Billions ?? -RRB- of dollars of extortion paid to terrorist organizations . \nWhere did You think all that money was coming from ? \nwe 've had discussions up the ying yang . \nwhat we need Now is a LEADER . \nthere is an old saying , `` if you ca n't lead , get behind me and push '' if there R a thousan boats out there get two thousand . \nif there are a thousand people on the beaches get five thousand . \nif the president thinks he 's too bright to get his feet wet and his hands dirty then get the Vice president out there . \nGet Someone OUT in FRONT of this mess and MAKE something happen , Who cares !!! My boyfriend thinks the same with me . \nHe - is eight years older than me , lol . \nMaybe you wanna check out or - tell your friends Are you kidding me John ? \nThis article makes no sense . \n3MI was a disaster to the industry because it was a disaster , and this is no different . \nThis is n't about hydrocarbon needs or reserves just as well as 3MI not being about us running out of plutonium . \nThe disaster at hand is just that . \nFor decades to come , that region will be polluted , and the economics of tourism and fisheries will be in turmoil . \nYou do realize that there is a human scale to all of this rather than just oil economics right ? \nLook past the need to write a sympathetic fluff piece and get to the real meat an potatoes thank you . \nI never thought I 'd say it but I do believe Reuters has lost its objectivity . \nYou should be ashamed of yourselves , or else you should sell off your BP portfolio before it is too late . \nAs well , this disaster will leave a lasting opinion , fear , and hate of the oil industry just as 3MI did to the nuclear industry . \nDo n't kid yourself , because it has already happened . \nOne of these days you journalists are going to wake up and realize the proles have finally awakened from their ignorance and the propaganda no longer works . \nFrom the looks of these responses , it 's already happening . \nJust more London based Reuters spewing complete and utter BS ! \nThis thing is not even remotely contained and this nonsensical moron is trying to draw parallels . \nGive me an Fing break - complete tripe - you guys would n't have made believable stories for Pravda ! \nIn contrast , BP s North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals including -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . \n3 strikes and still not out ? \nHow was BP allowed to undertake such a high-risk project in the first place with this kind of track record ? \nWho 's getting rich behind this ? \nPosted by doctorjay317 | Report as abusive I agree with the article . \nPeople were angry about 3MI enough to fight new nuclear plants because there are alternatives . \nPeople are angry at BP , but not enough to quit using oil products . \nThe industry wo n't be affected in the long term . \nPeople who were relatively casual about Three Mile Island are now looking at the BP fiasco , seeing the same thing all over again only with less radioactivity . \nA certain Jarvis Cocker song comes to mind . \nYou know the one . \nThunderhorse is a joint Exxon BP venture and it did n't sink it listed badly and is in production today . \nReuters get your facts right what about reminding the public of Ixtoc 1 flowing from Mexico for almost 10 months !! Mexico claimed sovereign immunity for damages from the US !!!! That leak soiled 162 miles of US beaches ! \nThis is n't Three Mile Island , it 's worse ! \n3MI did not result in one confirmed human death , while the Deepwater explosion has already claimed 11 lives . \nIt 's a shame the corresponding public opinion does n't have a modicrum of discernment . \nBP is going to pay over $ 50 billion when this all said and done . \nWe just launched a Facebook competitor at story+burn.com Of course , the BP disaster is not like Three Mile Island . \nThree Mile Island accident did not kill anyone ; the BP accident killed eleven people . \nThree Mile Island did not harm anyone in any way . \nRadiation release was so small in the Three Mile Island accident that one gets more radiation dose from flying across the country in a jet domestic flight . \nWho knows today what the human adverse effects will be from the BP disaster , but it will be very large indeed . \nThe environmental effects could be extreme in the BP disaster , not so for the Three Mile Island accident . \nThe Three Mile Island accident was an economic disaster to the tune of $ 6 Billion dollars in today 's dollars -LRB- replacement cost for a plant today -RRB- . \nThe BP disaster will be considerably more than this and bring down a huge company with a lot of layoffs of mostly very good people . \nThe utility owning the nuclear plant survives today . \nThe similarity between the two events is that human error caused problems to be amplified leading to failure . \nIn Three Mile Island , safety systems composed of multiple backup systems ultimately saved the situation and prevented adverse effects on the public . \nThis was not the case for the BP disaster because there were no redundancy of diverse safety systems . \nDeep sea drilling could learn a lot from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -LRB- NRC -RRB- of the US government that places regulations on the nuclear industry and enforces such . \nIt 's time for corporate\\/business punishments to exceed the gross revenue to have been derived from the incident 's resource . \nIf they had to give over the expected revenues from the well , they would not make mistakes . \nIf one well would break the company , then it should n't be in business . \nSmall fry should n't be in big business . \nNo more wrist slaps . \nTime to reform ALL businesses\\/types of incorporation excess . \nFinancial , Energy , et al , ad nauseum . \nCorporate aristocracy needs be tore down , rebuilt . \nEstimates vary , but they 'll still be `` cleaning up '' Hanford until at least 2040 . \nAt TMI , `` cleanup '' appears to amount largely to not talking about the extent of the core meltdown or how much radioactive gas really escaped . \nExxon has n't paid up all the court-ordered damages it owes on the 1989 Valdez catastrophe . \nBP has yet to show much comprehension of the nature and extent of damage caused by it and\\/or its contract partners over several recent events . \nFair enough , these disasters are n't all the same . \nJust , there 's too many of them involving the same sort of happy-go-lucky amateur executives with connections in high places , is all . \nJust wondering if there were any fines or penalties for the management or companies responsible for the `` Three Mile Island '' disaster . \nIt would be great if someone has a link they could send me respecting this information . \nThank you We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nJohn joined Reuters in 2008 as one of its first financial columnists , specialising in commodities and energy . \nWhile his main focus is on oil markets , he has written broadly on the emergence of commodities as an asset class , regulatory issues and macroeconomic themes . \nBefore joining Reuters , John spent seven years as a senior analyst for Sempra Commodities -LRB- now part of JP Morgan -RRB- covering base metals and crude oil . \nPreviously , he worked as an analyst on world trade , banking and financial regulation for consultancy Oxford Analytica . \n"}
{"id": "1047", "time": "2010-06-11", "text": "- Kees Willemse is professor of off-shore engineering , Delft University . \nThe opinions expressed are his own . \n- The news that a huge metal cap has been successfully placed over several of the leaking oil vents at the Deepwater Horizon site marks a potential turning point in the Gulf of Mexico crisis . \nIt is already estimated that each day some 10-15 ,000 barrels of the oil that are spilling out into the ocean are being captured and diverted to ships on the sea surface . \nDespite this engineering success , a complete end to the oil leakage is unlikely until new relief oil wells are completed -- a drilling process that could take most of the summer , and potentially into the autumn . \nThis is because the newly installed metal cap is unlikely , even in the best case scenario , to stop all of the oil spilling out . \nIn advance of the completion of the relief wells , a potentially major new complicating factor is the arrival of the hurricane season last week . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is already predicting between 8 and 14 hurricanes this season , with perhaps a similar number of smaller storms , any of which could complicate -LRB- or indeed force a postponement -RRB- of the ongoing mitigation and clean-up activities in and around Deepwater Horizon . \nAlthough the leakage will therefore continue for weeks to come , and the clean-up operations will take even longer , it is already clear that the disaster will herald a transformation in the oil industry by : cents Signaling a new re-regulatory era , especially in the U.S. , including the new six month moratorium on offshore drilling announced last month by President Barack Obama . \nAuthorities around the North Sea are also reasserting their positions . \ncents This will be paralleled by movement by the industry towards a new paradigm which , as is explored later in this article , may potentially require companies to adopt new operating models and much better engineering expertise of how to manage and mitigate disasters when they occur , especially in hard-to-reach oil in deep waters . \nAs BP CEO Tony Hayward has asserted , After the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , the industry created the Marine Spill Response Corporation to contain oil on the sea surface The issue now will be to create the same sub-sea response capability . \nThe crisis is now officially the worst U.S. spill in history , with between 500,000 to 800,000 barrels estimated to have leaked out into the Gulf of Mexico as of May 31 . \nWhile still dwarfed by the largest ever off-shore leakage of oil -LRB- an estimated 3,300,000 barrels in 1979 -RRB- at Ixtoc-1 in the Gulf of Mexico s Bay of Campeche , Deepwater Horizon is now at least twice as large a spillage as the 260,000 barrels estimated to have polluted the shores and caused major environmental damage in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 , although it should be realized that the crude oil of that vessel was considerably worse for the local environment . \nHence , the reason why Obama re-asserted last week that Deepwater Horizon will be the worst environmental disaster of its kind in U.S. history . \nWith U.S. mid-term congressional elections fast approaching in November , a regulatory clampdown upon the oil drilling industry appears likely . \nHowever , re-examining the regulatory framework is just one part of what is now needed . \nIn addition , much more emphasis should also be placed upon enhancing safety technology , and engineering expertise and preparedness of how to manage and mitigate disasters when they do occur , especially in hard-to-reach oil in deep waters . \nOn the safety technology side , we will need , in particular , to improve blow-out preventer technologies . \nIt is also likely that more than one of these blow-out devices will be needed at major sites in the future . \nHad a second blow-out preventor been in place at Deepwater Horizon , it is possible that the current disaster could have been completely averted . \nWhat is also badly needed is better management and mitigation preparation for sub-sea disasters . \nMuch of the equipment that was used in the various attempts to stem the oil flow was hastily designed on the spot and whilst the well was blurting out the oil in huge quantities . \nHence , the reason why BP CEO Tony Hayward candidly asserted that his firm did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit to respond faster to the crisis . \nThat the necessary expertise and preparedness has been lacking is reflected in the fact , for instance , that workers have needed to experiment with new technologies and devices such as the five-storey , 100 tonne containment dome which unsuccessfully was used to act as a giant funnel , collecting and piping the oil to the sea surface . \nBefore Deepwater Horizon , this procedure had only been used at much shallower depths with much lower pressures . \nThere is now an urgent need for before-the-event development and experimentation of this , and other techniques , in much deeper waters . \nMeeting these ambitions head-on will require , in the words of Hayward , nothing less than a paradigm change in the oil industry . \nAt a minimum , this will require all key industry parties -LRB- including exploration and production companies and drilling contractors , but also the engineers and researchers of the major universities with offshore expertise -RRB- to work together more closely to reduce the safety risks . \nHowever , it may also require a transformation in the oil industry business model which some assert has become excessively reliant on outsourcing important work to contractors . \nFor instance , while BP was in overall control of the Deepwater Horizon platform , responsibility for safety was shared with Transocean -LRB- which owned and operated the rig -RRB- , Halliburton -LRB- which cemented the wall -RRB- , and Cameron International -LRB- which manufactured the blow-out preventor -RRB- . \nReducing the risk of accidents in the future could involve moving towards a different model with less sub-contractors , or at least one company tasked with overall responsibility for safety . \nWhether such an operating model transformation happens or not , this new safety reform agenda can only be cost-effectively achieved if the oil industry prioritises it . \nIt is likely that the global public will settle for nothing less in the post-Deepwater Horizon world . \nPicture credit : A dead crab sits among the oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on a beach in Grand Terre Island , Louisiana , June 9 , 2010 . \nREUTERS\\/Lee Celano An excellent summary by Professor Willemse . \nAs a Brit , I am dismayed by Presisdent Obama 's recent anti-BP rhetoric . \nAs terrible as this oil spill is , the very fact that BP is shouldering all the responsibility , and is directing such vast recources at containing the leak and limiting the damage , should be recognized . \nTheir effort has been herculean . \nAs should be their speedy abd unstinting payment of all compensation claims -- the sums of money are vast . \nAt some point the net of culpability will have to be cast wider to include the legislators , Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron International , but in the meantime BP 's efforts should be rocognised . \nThere has always been a strong strand of anti-British sentiment in the US , that seems to me almost 18th century in sentiment . \nAs a Brit , it is disturbing to see President Obama tapping into this for purely populist reasons . \nTony Hayword has been lambasted for principly being rather self-deprecating and candid -- qualities perhaps not fully understood in the US . \nI think he should be congratulated . \nPut it this way , American politicians are proving considerably more oily . \nI get the impression that there are some within the US political class , not least President Obama , who wuold like to break BP . \nIt should not be forgotten that 39 % of BP is owned by American shareholders . \nHow much of what is being said now was said after the Ixtoc-1 spill in 1979 ? \nHow many proposals were put forward at that time ? \nAnd how many of them were adopted ? \nMy feeling is that all this has been said before but the big-oil lobby got to work after things had calmed down in 1979 and stopped anything important happening . \nThe same will happen now . \nGovernments never seem to learn that business can not be trusted to regulate itself -- the financial industry is another great example . \nI would also agree with the previous poster regarding culpability . \nYes BP was the responsible company and needs to pay for the consequences of it 's actions , but so too do Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron International . \nThe furore in the US press now feels like foreigner bashing without looking closer to home . \nHow much of what Exxon was ordered to pay in compensation after Alaska has it actually paid ? \nAnd how quickly was it paid ? \nI 'm sure it was n't ordered to pay for lost wages for the last 20 years . \nAs a

'' \nForty percent of BP 's shareholders are in the United States , with the same percentage based in Britain . \nBusiness leaders , politicians and newspapers have pressed Cameron to defend BP against the Obama administration , whose criticism of the British company has been portrayed in British media as Britain-bashing . \nCameron , who took office in May , is due to discuss the Gulf of Mexico crisis with Obama in a telephone call at 11 a.m. EDT on Saturday . \nThe call will be a tricky test for the two leaders . \nBoth are under pressure to appear tough to voters at home . \nObama , criticized by some in the United States over his handling of the crisis , has been seeking to direct public anger and frustration over the spill toward BP . \nFor his part , Cameron must show Britons that he is not caving in to pressure from his country 's most powerful ally . \nA spokeswoman for Cameron said the prime minister 's telephone call with Obama would be `` statesmanlike and workmanlike . '' \nA White House official played down the BP focus , saying it would be just one of a number of issues raised . \nShares in BP , which have lost tens of billions of dollars in value since the crisis began on April 20 , closed up 7.2 percent in London trading , rebounding from Thursday 's 13-year low and extending a rally that began in New York on Thursday . \nBP 's American depositary shares finished up 3.63 percent in New York on Friday . \n`` Possibly people have taken heart from the fact that the political rhetoric is not just one side of the Atlantic , '' said Barclays Capital analyst Lucy Haskins . \nInvestors appeared unfazed by the news from U.S. scientists that the well 's flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day . \nThe new estimates could have huge financial implications because under the U.S. Clean Water Act , BP and others could face fines up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked . \nWith more than 2 million barrels of oil already in the ocean , that could mean fines of $ 8.6 billion at least . \nBP expects the total bill for the clean-up of the spill , which has affected 120 miles of U.S. coastline and closed down rich fishing grounds , will be $ 3 - $ 6 billion , an analyst briefed by BP said in a research note on Friday . \nThe slick has already fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama . \nTar balls have also washed up on Florida 's famous white beaches . \nOne third of the Gulf 's federal waters remain closed for fishing . \n`` BP and all involved have downplayed this from day one . \nEveryone knew it was more than they reported and now basically it 's been proven , '' said Kindra Arnesen , a restaurant owner in Venice , Louisiana , whose husband makes his living fishing . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nChina might take over the BP fields ? \nChina is the most polluting nation on the planet , with no food , drug , or environmental laws to speak of . \nHalf the stuff that is imported from there has poisonous compounds . \nThat 's all we need -- from the frying pan into the fire . \nBP is the new Altria . \nThe lumbering cash flow rich giant kept alive just enough to feed the massive legal settlements This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1491", "time": "2010-06-29", "text": "HOUSTON | Tue Jun 29 , 2010 7:45 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Bad weather halted some clean-up efforts from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on Tuesday as high winds and waves from a strengthening storm threatened to hamper plans to capture more of the crude gushing from the largest spill in U.S. history . \nThe National Hurricane Center said tropical storm Alex would build into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season as it moved over southern Gulf waters . \nRipple effects from Alex produced six-foot -LRB- 1.8-meter -RRB- waves and wind gusts of up to 20 miles per hour and were expected to last a couple of days , said Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service in New Orleans . \nOffshore oil clean-up activity off the Louisiana coast was halted because of severe weather , the U.S. Coast Guard said . \nControlled burns of oil on the ocean , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all stopped , said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker . \nHowever , BP Plc 's oil-capture and relief well drilling continued at the site of the leak . \nGrigsby said the weather would also affect clean-up operations on beaches and marshes . \nAlex , forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later on Tuesday , was churning northwest across the southwestern Gulf and expected to come ashore near the Texas-Mexico border late Wednesday or early Thursday . \nBP spokesman Robert Wine said BP 's oil-capture and relief well drilling operations were continuing . \n`` That 's all big equipment , and it is n't as affected by the sea state , '' he said of three rigs and a drillship a mile above the leak . \nBP officials have said waves as high as 12 feet -LRB- 4 metros -RRB- would delay plans to hook up a third system to capture much more oil and officials in Florida said high surf would probably hamper clean-up efforts . \nBP 's market capitalization has shrunk by $ 100 billion since its Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank in 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metros -RRB- of water on April 22 , two days after an explosion and fire killed 11 workers . \nBut U.S.-listed shares of BP closed 2.29 percent higher at $ 27.67 on Tuesday on bargain-hunting . \nThe shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . \n`` It 's tough to say if the stock has bottomed because the political situation remains so fluid , but on a basis the stock is attractive , '' said John Brady , senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago . \nThe stock 's weakness since the disaster has also sparked talk of a possible takeover bid . \n`` The spill is bad , but you need to remember that BP is a global company with a global business , and there 's strength elsewhere , '' Brady said . \nThe oil spill crisis is in its 71st day with no firm end in sight . \nThe economic and ecological costs to tourism , wildlife , fishing and other industries , already massive , continue to mount for four states along the U.S. Gulf coast . \nThe lucrative tourism industry in the Gulf could be hard hit for years by a false perception the spill has ruined all the beaches , tourism officials said . \nU.S. government officials estimate 35,000 to 60,000 barrels are gushing from the blown-out well each day . \nBP 's containment system can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily . \nThe planned addition would have raised that to 53,000 bpd . \nSenior U.S. officials were beating a path to the Gulf region , responding to criticism that President Barack Obama and his administration responded too slowly to the crisis . \nTuesday 's visitors included Vice President Joe Biden . \nA U.S. appeals court set July 8 for oral arguments on the Obama administration 's request to stay a ruling that lifted its six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling . \nA federal judge blocked it at the request of drilling companies , saying the suspension was too broad and arbitrary . \nPolls have given Obama low marks for his handling of the disaster , although not as low as those given to BP . \n`` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York-based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications . \nMistakes include downplaying the environmental damage , initially blaming others for the disaster and underestimating the amount of oil leaking , analysts say . \nAs crude oil and dispersants float on the surface of the Gulf , crews are battling to keep it off beaches and away from wildlife breeding grounds . \nOn Louisiana 's Bay Baptiste , winds whipped waves up about a foot high and white caps were visible in the distance as the outer bands of Alex began to move into the region . \nSeveral marshes were only partially boom-protected , with oil coating the bottom part of reeds as crabs covered in crude scurried on nearby marsh islands . \nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30 and meteorologists predict this year will be very active , suggesting more problems for the oil spill clean-up effort . \nIn Biloxi , Mississippi , BP spokesman Richard Judy acknowledged problems with clean-up operations after the state 's mainland was hit by oil . \n`` What 's keeping us busy in this area is maintaining boom , in some cases putting out new boom , doing pick-up of oiled material on the beaches when it gets there and also going out and working on the coastal islands , '' Judy said . \n`` Weather has been a problem . \nWe have to be careful not to keep our crews on beaches if there 's lightning nearby . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nContainment and closure would have been better but then the loss of profits by the top 2 % would have been unbearable . \nSo , in keeping with the agenda of having the general population eat the garbage left by those who are presumed better human beings , we 'll just say `` how unfortunate that the hurrican season has n't been postponed . '' \nThis is yellow journalism at its best . \nIf there was n't an oil spill in the Gulf , nobody north of Brownsville would take a second look at Alex or any overzealous newscaster 's warning of `` coastal flooding '' on the north side or water churning in the Gulf . \nAs a native southeast Texan , I 've been through my share of hurricanes and tropical storms , and I can safely say that I am not the least bit worried about Alex , `` coastal flooding '' north of South Padre Island or any effect that it `` might '' have on the BP oil spill . \nYou just focus on getting that relief well drilled , BP , and those claims dispersed to the people who need them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nHis message over the lunch with senior journalists was clear : BP had one of the biggest engineering , logistical and financial problems the oil industry had ever faced , but the company was up to the challenge . \nWhat the CEO failed to mention was that BP also faced a massive political problem , perhaps the biggest such crisis for an oil company operating in the United States since Teddy Roosevelt broke up John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil . \nIt was a telling omission . \nBP 's failure to grasp the fact that its biggest challenge was in Washington , not the Gulf , has led to a series of gaffes and strategic communications errors that have inflamed public opinion , fanned the political firestorm and dragged the company 's share price ever lower . \nMost analysts expect the spill cleanup to cost under $ 30 billion , but BP 's market capitalization is down $ 100 billion , on expectations it will face fines of up to $ 30 billion as well as curbs on its business in the United States , its most important market . \nIt did n't have to be this way . \n`` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York-based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications . \n`` It was a combination of a lack of transparency , a lack of straight talking and a lack of sensitivity to the victims . \nWhen you 're managing an environmental disaster of this magnitude you not only have to manage the problem but also manage all the stakeholders . '' \nFrom the start , BP adopted positions that fueled suspicion . \nHayward repeatedly told reporters in the first days after the rig drilling the doomed well exploded that `` it was n't our accident . '' \nInstead , the CEO blamed Transocean , the company that operated the drilling rig . \n`` In such an awful and public situation , to immediately blame someone else , even if you 're right , is bad from a public relations standpoint , '' said Henry Sneath , First Vice-President with DRI , an association of U.S. corporate defense lawyers . \n`` You immediately blacken your reputation and poison potential jurors that might ultimately rule on your faith . '' \nThe company also failed to tackle its image as a serial safety and environmental offender . \nThat was especially true in the United States where regulators had blamed both a 2005 refinery blast that killed 15 workers and pipeline leaks in Alaska in 2006 on cost-cutting . \nWhen a Congressional Committee in mid-May highlighted this record , BP insisted it had changed . \nBut it could n't say how . \n`` BP 's inability to precisely describe the improvements it has made in its safety and operational culture took us by surprise , '' UBS said in a research note after the hearing . \nBP further weakened its credibility by underestimating the amount of oil leaking from its well . \nEven when scientists challenged the Coast Guard 's 5,000 barrel-per-day estimate of the flow rate , BP defended it robustly . \nOn May 14 , Bob Dudley , BP 's director for the Americas , told MSNBC the 5,000 bpd figure was `` a good estimate '' and that calculations of up to 70,000 bpd were `` scaremongering . '' \nOn June 15 , a government panel said the flow rate was actually up to 60,000 bpd and internal BP documents released by a U.S. Congressman last week showed BP had itself calculated the well could flow at up to 100,000 bpd . \n`` Once you 've lost trust and credibility , your ability to get your message across is critically hampered , '' said Jonathan Hemus , director of Insignia Communications . \nThen there were Hayward 's mistakes . \nTelling interviewers the spill was `` relatively tiny '' and that the environmental impact was likely to be `` very , very modest '' was interpreted as a crude attempt to downplay the spill 's impact . \nEven worse was Hayward 's comment on TV that he wanted his life back . \nPredictably , wives of some of the 11 men who died in the rig blast responded that they 'd like their husbands back . \nOn June 25 , Hayward 's boss , the BP Chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg said Hayward was returning to the UK , admitting the CEO 's remarks had `` upset people . '' \nA day later , Hayward showed he could upset the U.S. public just as capably from the other of the Atlantic , when he was photographed aboard his yacht off the Isle of Wight as the oil spill confined fishermen in Louisiana to port . \n`` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting , '' White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told ABC news after the yachting incident . \nWhat makes the mistakes even worse , is that BP should have been well placed to mount a world-class crisis PR effort . \nThe firm had almost unlimited resources . \nIts chairman was a media-savvy former telecoms CEO . \nAnd its head of public relations , Andrew Gowers , was a former editor of the Financial Times , and one-time Reuters reporter , with recent experience of crisis management : Gowers headed Lehman Brothers PR team during its collapse , although the rapidity and breadth of the banking meltdown was such that no amount of PR could have saved the bank . \nYet the oil giant had a key shortcoming . \nBP 's British CEO had never held a position in the United States , its Swedish chairman had limited U.S. experience , and Gowers ' only stint working in the United States was his few months with Lehman . \nHayward exacerbated his lack of U.S. savvy by choosing another Briton , Alan Parker , head of the UK 's largest financial PR agency , Brunswick , as his external PR adviser . \nIt was n't until late May before the company appointed a heavy-hitting U.S. PR representative -- Dick Cheney 's former spokeswoman , Anne Kolton . \nThe lack of local knowledge hurt BP in those first few weeks . \nU.S. executives say that it is difficult for European executives , especially those who have n't spent a long time working in the United States , to understand the combatative political landscape there . \n`` In Europe , the attitude would be much more , ` the company is the only one who can solve the problem , so what do we need to do to help the company to get it sorted ?

{"id": "403", "time": "2010-06-16", "text": "LONDON | Wed Jun 16 , 2010 2:12 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks , as estimates of the volume of oil leaking from its Gulf of Mexico well have risen and politicians blame corner-cutting for the accident . \nReuters looked at possible scenarios for BP earlier this month . \nThe following is an updated look at what might be in store for the London-based oil major , whose shares now stand 45 percent below the pre-blow out levels . \nBP RUNS OUT OF CASH - UNLIKELY BP says it has spent $ 1.6 billion so far to cap the leaking well and clean up the spill and estimated last week it would spend $ 3 - $ 6 billion in total this year . \nThe company generated cash of $ 7.7 billion from operating activities in the first quarter . \nEven after capital investment of $ 3.8 billion , it had $ 3.9 billion of free cash and the company says it has arranged significant credit lines . \nCompensation to those affected by the spill has risen to $ 62 million but could grow sharply as President Barack Obama wants BP to establish an independent fund to pay damages . \nThe annual economic loss of tourism and fishing revenues in the states of Alabama , Louisiana and Mississippi could result in claims as high as $ 10.3 billion , while a reduction of one third in Florida 's tourism industry could add another $ 12 billion to the bill , analysts at Citigroup said . \nBP 's partners in the well , Anadarko Petroleum and Japan 's Mitusi , have not said whether they will help with compensation . \nThey are legally bound to pay on the basis of their 25 percent and 10 percent respective stakes in the field . \nThe upper end of analysts ' forecasts of total costs is around $ 30 - $ 35 billion , with potential extra costs for lost fisheries business in years to come . \nAnalysts say BP may not be able to cover such costs , and pay its dividend , out of cashflow alone , forcing additional borrowing . \nHowever , the oil giant is believed to be able to do so without bringing its gearing levels above its targeted 20-30 percent range . \nOne key risk is that the Administration has said it wants BP to compensate those workers laid off due to the moratorium on deepwater drilling imposed in the wake of the accident -- a cost BP thinks it should not have to pay . \nSo far few , if any , workers have been laid off as oil companies have , with a few exceptions including Anadarko , have not invoked force majeure clauses that allow them cancel rig contracts . \nAnalysts at Raymond James & Associates said in a report on Monday that about 49,500 direct jobs are at risk from the moratorium . \nBP BECOMES A TAKEOVER TARGET - UNLIKELY Speculation that BP could become a takeover target has been heightened in recent days by news the company had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs as an advisor . \nExxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and France 's Total are the only fully publicly traded oil companies larger than BP and deemed financially strong enough to buy it . \nTotal 's Chief Executive Christophe de Margerie said it would be `` unethical '' to make an approach and analysts think the CEOs of the other companies would also be reluctant to bid . \nRegulators could force the sale of U.S. refineries into an uncertain market for such assets and the sale of valuable U.S. gas fields , threatening the upside of a deal . \nHowever , the biggest deterrent is the open-ended nature of BP 's liabilities . \nA potential suitor would also fear reputational contamination , analysts said . \nA takeover by a state-backed entity like one of the Chinese oil companies is inconceivable , analysts said , as BP is the U.S. 's biggest oil producer and given the blocking of the sale of U.S. listed and Asia-focused Unocal to a Chinese company . \nCEO HAYWARD LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR NOW Tony Hayward has been a target for highly personal attacks in the United States over some poorly chosen comments . \nObama said he would fire Hayward if the CEO worked for him . \nAnalysts and investors have been kinder , taking the view that the accident reflects the intrinsically risky nature of oil exploration . \nThey say BP has done all that could be done to stem the leak and to compensate those affected . \nBP 's Chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg has also backed Hayward . \nHowever , this support could begin to unravel if accusations by U.S. lawmakers -- that BP took shortcuts when drilling the blown out well -- stick . \nHayward took up his role promising to standardize and streamline the way BP builds facilities and drills oil wells . \nIf the structures he put in place appear to have led to decisions that contributed to the accident , the CEO 's position could come under pressure . \nThe CEOs of Chevron and Exxon implicitly criticized BP 's practices in testimony to a congressional hearing on Tuesday . \nBookmaker Paddy Power is offering odds on Hayward 's departure by December 31 that suggest punters think it is more likely the CEO will go . \nCHAIRMAN LOSES HIS JOB - UNLIKELY , FOR NOW Svanberg has been criticized by investors and several British newspapers for his low profile in the response effort . \nHis behavior has been contrasted with the high-profile approach taken by predecessor Peter Sutherland , nicknamed by Hayward as BP 's `` tank , '' when forcing former CEO John Browne to name a retirement date and defending BP 's Russian interests in a dispute with Russian partners . \nBP says it was a deliberate strategy to make Hayward the public face of the company to avoid confusing the public . \nBut other executives , including Americas Director Bob Dudley and U.S. Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles -- both Americans -- have also fronted the response operation in TV interviews . \nCritics say Svanberg 's low profile reflects his lack of high-level experience of the United States and his personality . \nBut BP found it difficult to replace Sutherland so investors may be reluctant to embark on another chairman hunt with Svanberg in the job less than a year . \nThe chairman meets Obama on Wednesday to discuss proposals to create an independent fund for compensating those affected . \nA polished performance from the former CEO of Sweden 's Ericsson could help solidify his position . \nBP TO LOSE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS - LIKELY , BUT IMPACT MINOR Under federal law BP would be banned from government contracts for a period if convicted of a criminal offence under the Clean Water Act . \nIt could also be barred from contracts if found guilty of violating environmental laws . \nThe company has multi-billion dollar contracts to supply fuel to government departments such as the military . \nHowever , the government would have to weigh the impact of such a move . \nFor example , it may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers in locations like Afghanistan . \nAlso , selling fuel is one of the lowest margin businesses oil companies operate . \nMuch more money is made from pumping oil from the ground and even if the government does n't buy BP 's Jet fuel or gasoline , others will . \nSo the absolute value of contracts affected may not be material to BP . \nBP TO FACE GROWTH HEADWINDS IN THE FUTURE - LIKELY BP 's targets for expanded production will become tougher to achieve and its financial performance will suffer from higher costs -- even after spill costs and fines are paid . \nBP said earlier this year it was targeting oil and gas output growth of 1-2 percent over the medium term . \nThis plan relies heavily on BP 's U.S. projects and especially the Gulf of Mexico , where it was leading the push into ever-deeper waters . \nThe effort to cap the Macondo well is diverting manpower , assets and management time that should be directed toward achieving the company 's targets . \nEven when the oil spill has been dealt with and the drilling moratorium is lifted , BP 's damaged reputation is likely to mean more scrutiny from regulators than other companies , analysts said . \nThis means it will likely take longer than it would have expected in the past to bring fields to production . \nSome commentators have called on BP to have its licenses removed . \nBP TO FACE FINES AND PENALTIES - LIKELY BP faces potential fines under several anti-pollution laws and the recent increases in the estimate of how much oil is leaking from its well suggest this could amount to a major liability . \nThe company has already clocked up potential fines of up to $ 9 billion , based on a possible $ 4,300 per barrel fine for polluting major waterways . \nWith tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaking each day , the fines are still mounting . \nHowever , it is unclear whether the government will seek the maximum fines or whether it will offset money spent remediating the damage when setting fines . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nFREEZE Bandits ... who are now changing their gas station identify from signs which said BP and now reads : Shell in Everett , PA ? \nWhy not keep that BP name flying high ... . \nwe know who Shell is ! \nAlong with this : BP Promises to Save for a Rainy Day , Pay for Damages , and Tax Payers will Pay It ALL Socialism apparently does n't seem bother many when it is used to bail out their friends , but god forbid you get an American insurance they need , help to go to school , give more money to public schools , etc. . \nSocialism is demonized by the very same folks that seem to support it when it is for their corporate `` friends '' BP gets 35 billion in tax breaks How convenient that this will cover their supposedly canceling of dividends , allowing 10.5 billion to go to share holders . \nThat leaves BP with 5 billion ... . . \nfor destroying the gulf coast , thousands of lives and many years to come of unknown environmental , economical damages . \nBP dividends : $ 2.63 billion -- Investors and lawmakers are waiting to see about future payouts . \nAnalysts expected pay of $ 10.5 billion this year . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "187", "time": "2010-06-16", "text": "WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Following are remarks by President Barack Obama provided by the White House . \nAs we speak , our nation faces a multitude of challenges . \nAt home , our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American . \nAbroad , our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists . \nAnd tonight , I 've returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we 're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens . \nOn April 20th , an explosion ripped through BP 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , about forty miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nEleven workers lost their lives . \nSeventeen others were injured . \nAnd soon , nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean , oil began spewing into the water . \nBecause there has never been a leak of this size at this depth , stopping it has tested the limits of human technology . \nThat is why just after the rig sank , I assembled a team of our nation 's best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge '' a team led by Dr. Steven Chu , a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation 's Secretary of Energy . \nScientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice . \nAs a result of these efforts , we have directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology . \nIn the coming days and weeks , these efforts should capture up to 90 % of the oil leaking out of the well . \nThis is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . \nAlready , this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . \nAnd unlike an earthquake or a hurricane , it is not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days . \nThe millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . \nBut make no mistake : we will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes . \nWe will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . \nAnd we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . \nTonight I 'd like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward : what we 're doing to clean up the oil , what we 're doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf , and what we 're doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again . \nFirst , the cleanup . \nFrom the very beginning of this crisis , the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation 's history an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen , who has almost forty years of experience responding to disasters . \nWe now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and cleanup the oil . \nThousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf . \nAnd I have authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast . \nThese servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore , clean beaches , train response workers , or even help with processing claims and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible . \nBecause of our efforts , millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning , skimming , and other collection methods . \nOver five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil . \nWe have approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try and stop the oil before it reaches the shore , and we are working with Alabama , Mississippi , and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines . \nAs the clean up continues , we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need . \nNow , a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect , and new challenges will always arise . \nI saw and heard evidence of that during this trip . \nSo if something is n't working , we want to hear about it . \nIf there are problems in the operation , we will fix them . \nBut we have to recognize that despite our best efforts , oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife . \nAnd sadly , no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . \nThat 's why the second thing we 're focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . \nYou know , for generations , men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water . \nThat living is now in jeopardy . \nI 've talked to shrimpers and fishermen who do n't know how they 're going to support their families this year . \nI 've seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected . \nI 've talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists will start to come back . \nThe sadness and anger they feel is not just about the money they 've lost . \nIt 's about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost . \nI refuse to let that happen . \nTomorrow , I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness . \nAnd this fund will not be controlled by BP . \nIn order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner , the account must and will be administered by an independent , third party . \nBeyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short-term , it 's also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region . \nThe oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that has already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats . \nAnd the region still has n't recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . \nThat 's why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment . \nI make that commitment tonight . \nEarlier , I asked Ray Mabus , the Secretary of the Navy , a former governor of Mississippi , and a son of the Gulf , to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible . \nThe plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists , and other Gulf residents . \nAnd BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region . \nThe third part of our response plan is the steps we 're taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again . \nA few months ago , I approved a proposal to consider new , limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken . \nThat was obviously not the case on the Deepwater Horizon rig , and I want to know why . \nThe American people deserve to know why . \nThe families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion these families deserve to know why . \nAnd so I have established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place . \nAlready , I have issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nI know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs , but for the sake of their safety , and for the sake of the entire region , we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue . \nAnd while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible , I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially . \nOne place we have already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits , known as the Minerals Management Service . \nOver the last decade , this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves . \nAt this agency , industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight . \nOil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors , and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations . \nWhen Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior , one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency . \nBut it 's now clear that the problems there ran much deeper , and the pace of reform was just too slow . \nAnd so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency Michael Bromwich , who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General . \nHis charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry 's watchdog not its partner . \nOne of the lessons we 've learned from this spill is that we need better regulations better safety standards , and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling . \nBut a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry , drilling for oil these days entails greater risk . \nAfter all , oil is a finite resource . \nWe consume more than 20 % of the world 's oil , but have less than 2 % of the world 's oil reserves . \nAnd that 's part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean because we 're running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water . \nFor decades , we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered . \nFor decades , we have talked and talked about the need to end America 's century-long addiction to fossil fuels . \nAnd for decades , we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires . \nTime and again , the path forward has been blocked not only by oil industry lobbyists , but also by a lack of political courage and candor . \nThe consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight . \nCountries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be here in America . \nEach day , we send nearly $ 1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil . \nAnd today , as we look to the Gulf , we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude . \nWe can not consign our children to this future . \nThe tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now . \nNow is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny . \nThis is not some distant vision for America . \nThe transition away from fossil fuels will take some time , but over the last year and a half , we have already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry . \nAs we speak , old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines , people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows , and small businesses are making solar panels . \nConsumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks , and families are making their homes more energy-efficient . \nScientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that will someday lead to entire new industries . \nEach of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us . \nAs we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good , middle-class jobs but only if we accelerate that transition . \nOnly if we seize the moment . \nAnd only if we rally together and act as one nation workers and entrepreneurs ; scientists and citizens ; the public and private sectors . \nWhen I was a candidate for this office , I laid out a set of principles that would move our country toward energy independence . \nLast year , the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America 's businesses . \nNow , there are costs associated with this transition . \nAnd some believe we ca n't afford those costs right now . \nI say we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security , and our environment are far greater . \nSo I am happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels . \nSome have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks . \nSome believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power . \nOthers wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development . \nAll of these approaches have merit , and deserve a fear hearing in the months ahead . \nBut the one approach I will not accept is inaction . \nThe one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is too big and too difficult to meet . \nYou see , the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II . \nThe same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon . \nAnd yet , time and again , we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom . \nInstead , what has defined us as a nation since our founding is our capacity to shape our destiny our determination to fight for the America we want for our children . \nEven if we 're unsure exactly what that looks like . \nEven if we do n't yet know precisely how to get there . \nWe know we 'll get there . \nIt is a faith in the future that sustains us as a people . \nIt is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now . \nEach year , at the beginning of shrimping season , the region 's fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe . \nIt 's called `` The Blessing of the Fleet , '' and today it 's a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea some for weeks at a time . \nThe ceremony goes on in good times and in bad . \nIt took place after Katrina , and it took place a few weeks ago at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced . \nAnd still , they came and they prayed . \nFor as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition , `` The blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers . \nThe blessing is that He is with us always , '' a blessing that 's granted `` even in the midst of the storm . '' \nThe oil spill is not the last crisis America will face . \nThis nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again . \nWhat sees us through -- what has always seen us through -- is our strength , our resilience , and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it . \nTonight , we pray for that courage . \nWe pray for the people of the Gulf . \nAnd we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm toward a brighter day . \nThank you , God Bless You , and may God Bless the United States of America . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nObama ca n't stop the leak or the rhetoric . \nThe Obama 's rethoric does n't come from a leak . \nIt is outside coming from the Stern report on the global warming . \nAmerican people are denying the pollution of the air caused by the industry , would they able to deny the pollution of the sea caused by the same activity and its leader the British Polluter ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nSvanberg promised to make sure damage claims are handled swiftly and fairly . \nChief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP 's response to the disaster , will appear on Thursday at a congressional hearing where he will face intense scrutiny over events leading up to the spill and BP 's cleanup of the mess . \nAn April 20 explosion on an offshore rig leased by BP killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well . \nThe ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . \nWhile Obama stressed the agreement would not cap BP 's total liabilities , Wall Street appeared to cheer the small dose of clarity the deal provided , driving up the company 's share price by 1.5 percent in New York . \nUnder the agreement , BP committed to pay $ 20 billion into an independently managed fund over four years , suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year and pay $ 100 million to workers idled by the six-month moratorium on deep-sea drilling that the Obama administration imposed after the spill . \nThe $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP 's average annual profits over the past four years . \n`` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable , '' Obama said at the White House . \n`` And I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . '' \nThe fund will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds . \nObama had pressed BP to set up a fund administered by a third party after hearing first-hand complaints from Gulf Coast residents that BP 's claims process was too complicated and the company was paying out too little money . \nWith thousands of Gulf Coast commercial fishermen largely idled by the spill , Louisiana shrimper Clifton Bartholomew , 21 , wondered whether $ 20 billion would be enough . \n`` If you add it all up together -- everybody in shrimping , fishing , the whole industry -- by the time this is all gone I think they 'll need more than $ 20 billion , '' Bartholomew said . \nBP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to create the fund . \nThe commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had hoped for . \nThey had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb its growth . \nBP said it would cancel the first-quarter dividend due for payment on June 21 and would not declare interim dividends for the second and third quarters of 2010 . \nThe payouts were expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with recent quarters . \nObama stressed BP was `` a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . '' \nThe oil giant represents a large part of investment portfolios in Britain . \nObama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill last weekend . \nBP 's shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent before swinging to positive territory on news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account . \n`` It 's a step in the right direction for BP but unfortunately I can not say the same for Tony Hayward because it is going to get tougher for him , '' said Fadel Gheit , managing director of oil and gas research at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co in New York `` Tomorrow he 's going to be in the hot seat under glaring lights and tremendous animosity and criticism '' at the hearing . \nThe BP chief executive will tell lawmakers the entire oil and natural gas industry needs to be better prepared for deepwater accidents , according to his prepared testimony . \nThat is an apparent response to attempts by rival oil companies to distance themselves from BP 's disaster at a hearing on Tuesday . \nAs BP stock saw some relief , shares in Anadarko fell 3.69 percent and Transocean lost 3.09 percent in New York . \nAnadarko is part owner of the blown-out well and Transocean owned the rig that blew up . \nBack in the Gulf , BP said it started a second system to siphon oil from the leak on Wednesday , a day after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI think we need stand behind Mr. Obama . \nJun 15 , 2010 8:45 pm EDT -- Report as abuse The oil company presidents would say anything to save their companies from being seized by the government . \nThey might balk at taking their pants off in front of live television , but that is all . \nWith enough congressional insistence , they would comply . \nThe POTUS got to use his skills of mass hypnosis on everyone who watched his speech . \nYou will believe he is competent and not responsible ... . \nNo alternative energy source gives as many portable Joules per pound as oil . \nAnd we are running out of them . \nSociety as a whole must profoundly change . \nBut voters do n't want to hear that . \nWe must return to 1900 -- but with 26 times as many people . \nLet 's send everyone in Congress who ever voted for deepsea drilling down to the Gulf Coast to get their hands even dirtier and clean up their mess . \nAnd the navy needs to arrest Tony Hayward BP CEO . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

the marsh was in good shape , there was lots of clean water , '' said Griffin . \nIn the New Orleans suburb of Belle Chasse , oysterman Kuzma Tesvich said he had had high hopes for 2010 . \n`` Our crop was good . \nWe expected a good season and a good year but after all this we do n't know what 's going to happen to our oysters out there in the water , '' he said . \nHe said he had received his $ 5,000 from BP but said he was making $ 2,000 a day before the spill closed down his 1,500-acre -LRB- 600-hectare -RRB- oyster operation . \nBP has said it is aware that recent years ' earnings are below what some people could reasonably have expected to make this year . \nLast week , it said it would appoint an independent mediator to settle any disputes over claims that arise . \nIt has also said it will be flexible with people who do n't have all of their paperwork in order . \nHundreds of Gulf Coast fishermen are also being paid by BP to help with its oil spill containment operations , which also clearly helps bridge some of the lost earnings gap . \nBut the notion of handouts is alien to the resilient people here , many of whom have a strong sense of independence . \n`` These people are self-employed , they are not used to being reduced to handouts and to looking for help , '' said Father Gerry , the Catholic priest in the bayou town of Port Sulphur . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI do n't think the damage will be confined to the Gulf area as this article seems to indicate . \nThe oil spill is spreading not only on the surface but also deep in the ocean , and fish in any depth of the ocean would wallow the oil droplet and many would swim to faraway places or would be eaten by other fish which end up at faraway places . \nEventually the fishery industry of the entire lower 48 states would be damaged . \nI do n't know if it is safe to eat seafood in Boston or NYC a couple of years down the road . \nAny expert opinions on this ? \nURGENT_GET THIS MESSAGE TO OBAMA : get ALL the major oil companies , Shell , Exxon , etc , all the data they need to work on stopping the oil leak . \nWhoever stops it first then they give BP the bill . \nWhoever can clean it up the quickest , BP gets their bill too . \nEveryone post and pass this message on . \nFinger point AFTER leak stopped and cleanup in progress . \nSomeone at Lloyds of London insurance Company sold BP , policies covering just such an oil spill as is happening now , knowing full well that BP did not know how to fix problems like this . \nLloyds needs to find out who did the selling as they are responsible for massive claims that LLOYDS will have to pay . \nProbably the same people that sold BP shares short a few months ago and the same people that saw to it the rig got blown up . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels . '' \nBut BP 's Odone said , `` I do n't think there 's been any underestimating . \nWe 've always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled and that 's exactly what we 're doing . '' \nThe document was posted on the Internet here London 's Sunday Times , without citing any sources , said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales over the next two years to cover the cost of the spill . \nBP said last week it would suspend dividend payments to its shareholders and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion this year to offset liabilities from the spill , which began after an explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers . \nThe Financial Times reported BP is considering doubling the $ 10 billion asset sale program as part of a push to strengthen the company 's liquidity as it comes under financial pressure . \nBP said 21,040 barrels of oil -LRB- 883,680 gallons\\/3 .34 million liters -RRB- -RRB- leaking from the well was collected by its siphoning systems Saturday . \nA large amount of oil continues to leak into the sea from the ruptured well a mile below the ocean surface despite the BP containment systems . \nKenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator appointed to run the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims for financial losses due to the oil spill , said he would make sure that `` every eligible , legitimate claim is paid and paid quickly . '' \nAppearing on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Feinberg rejected the complaint of a senior Republican congressman , Joe Barton , who said last week that the fund set up by BP under pressure from President Barack Obama amounted to a government `` shakedown . '' \n`` I do n't think it helps to politicize this program , '' said Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer who dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . \n`` This a voluntary program . \nNo one is compelled to come into this fund . '' \nDespite assurances of swift compensation , Louisiana Gulf residents remained skeptical . \n`` Every time they say there 's a fund for fisherman , we wait years and years , '' said Tal Plork , whose fisherman husband , Phan , faced long waits for aid after two hurricanes rampaged across the Gulf region in 2008 . \n`` It was like that for Gustav and Ike . \nHopefully now they will go faster . '' \nPlork , 42 , has had to go to work since the oil leak began because her husband 's fishing income has dried up . \nShe works at a cafeteria at the BP camp in Venice , Louisiana , and has been supporting her five children mainly on credit cards . \nMississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also appearing on `` Meet the Press , '' said he was anxious to see the well capped , the spill cleaned up and BP cover the entire cost . \n`` Nothing is satisfactory until the well is shut in . \nWhen the well is capped , then clean up the oil , and then BP pays the bills . \nUntil all of that is done , nothing is satisfactory , '' said Barbour , a Republican . \nBarbour said he thought the U.S. federal government `` has done more right than wrong '' in its handling of the disaster . \nAfter falling 6.8 percent last week , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . \nDespite the battering to its reputation and stock stemming from the disaster , hedge fund T2 Partners said it likes shares in the British oil firm , according to a Barron 's article published Sunday . \nIn a column titled `` Other Voices , '' T2 's managing partners said their reasons for recently taking a new position in BP are that it is `` extraordinarily cheap , '' and that the firm is `` highly likely '' to be able to cover clean-up , damages , fines and lawsuits relating to the disaster . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNobody thought it was insensitive of Obama to vacation in an $ 8m house after his inauguration , when so many people lived in their car because of the great recession . \nI 'm sure , the people in Iraq and Afghanistan would also like to get their life back after the US invasions for no more real purpose than : oil . \n20 Billion $ for the oil clean up ? \nIt 's for the U.S. Government to embezzle . \nVery little of that money will make it to the Gulf victims . \nDo you know who is going to pay for the oil clean up ? \nYep , We will probably pay a couple of bucks per a gallon more at the pump in a year or two . \nMost of that 20 billion dollars will end up in some off shore bank and then in the pockets of who knows who ?????????

{"id": "1581", "time": "2010-05-07", "text": "Special report : Will the cleanup make the BP oil spill worse ? \nCORDOVA , Alaska\\/SAN FRANCISCO | Fri May 7 , 2010 2:25 pm EDT CORDOVA , Alaska\\/SAN FRANCISCO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More than half an inch of oil covered the sea when Dennis Kelso 's boat , piled with a few newly dead birds , nudged up against the side of the Exxon Valdez on Friday , March 24 , 1989 . \nA rope ladder hung down the side of one of the biggest vessels on earth , which had run aground near midnight on a reef in pristine Prince William Sound , a haven for birds , whales and otters , brimming with fish that supplied a multimillion dollar industry . \nIt is also next to the end of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline , and the Exxon Valdez had picked up millions of gallons of crude piped from the top of the frosty state to bring to gas-thirsty consumers in Long Beach , California . \nSpring was breaking , migrations were starting -- and Kelso was gagging at the rush of chemicals from the liberated oil . \n`` At the beginning oil was literally boiling out of the tanker , '' said Kelso , the head of Alaska 's Department of Environmental Conservation at the time . \nThe crude began changing as it hit the water , releasing benzene and other pungent chemicals into the air , the start of a months-long process of transforming from a light liquid to a tarry gunk that would cling to more than a thousand miles of beaches in southern Alaska . \nA close examination of studies of the Exxon Valdez disaster and interviews with many people who took part in the cleanup offers a possible peek into what lies ahead for the Gulf Coast in the coming weeks , months , years -- and perhaps decades . \nIndeed , by one estimate , about 21,000 gallons of oil still linger on some of Alaska 's beaches , often in the form of dark brown globs just beneath the rocks . \nWhat 's more , there are still some experts who argue that the aggressive cleanup following the Exxon Valdez spill proved more harmful than the oil itself . \nThat continuing debate points to another potential cautionary tale about how conflicts among various groups looking to make things right can end up hampering cleanup efforts . \nThe Exxon Valdez was an unrivaled environmental disaster which forced the United States to set a new standard for response to oil spills . \nNothing in the United States had come close -- until now . \nAs oil spreads across the Gulf of Mexico , a continent away , from the remnants of a British Petroleum well , the debates over how to contain the crude and what to do when it hits shore are similar to the arguments in Alaska two decades ago . \nSurprisingly , not much has changed in the technology of cleaning up oil spills , and research on what to do is dominated by `` gray literature '' funded by either oil companies or environmental organizations that makes some experts wary . \nIt 's clear , though , that the warm Gulf waters lapping marshes in Louisiana and the white sand beaches stretching from Mississippi to northern Florida are a world of difference from Alaska 's chilly , craggy , rocky southern coast . \nTwo mercurial forces -- weather and people -- are key for any cleanup . \nIn many ways both acted against Exxon , beset by storms of nature and among warring scientists and politicians , and have played to BP 's advantage . \nPrevailing winds have largely kept the giant Gulf oil slick offshore for two weeks since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident triggered the breach , and the coast guard is firmly in charge . \nOn the day two decades ago in Alaska , the question of who was in charge was open . \nThe day was calm and the sea was smooth -- perfect conditions for containing a slick of crude . \nBut the view from the bridge , abandoned by the captain after his crew drove the Valdez out of shipping lanes and onto a well known reef , was eerily clear . \nExxon had a plan to respond to spills , but the ` designated responder ' it had hired was n't responding . \nIn fact , the boat that was supposed to be in the water , ready to launch at the first word of an accident , had been in dry dock covered with snow . \nThe Valdez ran into the reef at four minutes after midnight . \nThe captain was n't on the bridge and had been drinking alcohol earlier in the evening . \nEleven of the ship 's cargo holds were punctured , and the first of 11 million gallons started filling Prince William Sound . \nThe Valdez , roughly three American football fields long , eventually lost 20 percent of its cargo , although the exact figure was never known , since seawater flowing into the ship made it difficult to measure how much was left . \nThe uncapped well in the Gulf has been spewing out around 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- a day . \nCleaning up oil is tough at the beginning and gets harder every day . \nThe first job is to contain a spill , a nearly impossible task in the real world . \nOn the water , booms which absorb and contain spills on relatively calm seas can be used to herd it into big pools that can be sucked up or burned . \nBurning needs perfect conditions , and one engineer compared a siphon to a toothpick in the Gulf . \nChemical dispersants which separate crude into fine droplets can be sprayed from ships and planes . \nRusty-colored oil ` mousse ' can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico where dispersants mixed into the water by waves are breaking down the oil . \nAbove all , the oil needs to be kept off shore , which over time is the most difficult thing to do . \nWhen oil hits land it 's often for a short visit -- dropping off a sheen and then moving with the tides up or down the shoreline . \nEventually though , the oil ages , becoming a tar -- like a blob that gloms onto a surface and wo n't let go . \nThat 's fine on a hard-packed sandy beach , which is the best place for an oil spill , since a careful lift of a thin layer of sand can get rid of most of the problem . \nBut in marshes , new and old oil can spread thin and deep with a ferocity that makes any cleanup counterproductive -- boots kill more than the oil . \nAlaska 's rocky coast is somewhere in between the two extremes , and just where the risks lay , and what the risks involved , is still debated today . \nThe threats to wildlife are legion . \nFish eggs in water and turtle eggs on land can be fouled by oil . \nGrowing fish mutate , otters and whales swimming through oil can get sick or suffocate from the fumes or oil coating their breathing passages . \nPetroleum fouls feathers , and small sea creatures can ingest chemicals and die . \nHow that affects the environment is still being studied . \nDo tiny sea creatures eat the tiny droplets of oil , creating a food chain timebomb in the way that mercury levels concentrate in bigger fish ? \nResearchers say they do n't know or disagree . \nThe Southern Shrimp Alliance in the Gulf Coast fears just such long term effects . \nThe experts converging on Alaska had seen hundreds of spills . \nTwo decades later , they agree on one thing with regard to Exxon Valdez : the first three days were lost . \nAl Maki , Exxon 's chief scientist at the time , flew in early and knew what to do : break up the oil with chemical dispersants . \nThe chemicals , which are being used widely in the current Gulf spill crisis , break oil into fine droplets so that it can be absorbed into the water and degrade naturally . \nWarm water and wave action speed the mixing and energy . \n`` If we had a chance to use dispersants earlier in the game , it would have reduced the landing impact substantially , '' said Maki . \nExxon , which was in charge of the cleanup , was n't allowed to use dispersants for three critical , calm days , after the early Friday crash , he said . \n`` The storm that came through on Sunday night moved the oil way out beyond our reaches and the use of dispersants was canceled , '' he said . \nKelso remembers the early days differently , though his conclusion is the same . \n`` The window of opportunity to move as much oil out of the water as possible was squandered , '' he said . \nExxon , which had relied on an unreliable contractor to prepare for the spill , was scrambling in the first few days . \nDispersants were n't at hand , and a trial of them was a flop in the cold , still water , he said . \nConflicts over dispersants were one of the first between the main players in the cleanup -- state authorities like Kelso , Exxon leaders like Maki , and the federal government , including John Robinson , the chief scientist at the spill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nRobinson remembers two years of animosity and contention , a management problem that contributed to the oil spill issue -- and which was dealt with directly by legislation the following year that gave the federal government clear authority to step in and take charge of a spill response , as it has done on the Gulf Coast . \nThe state was so unhappy , `` it was difficult for them to agree to almost anything in terms of the approach to cleanup , '' Robinson , now retired , said by phone . \nThe storm which swept through three days after the crash totally changed the game , making it a desperate attempt to keep oil away from sensitive areas and muster resources . \nA state report compared the work to `` guerrilla warfare . '' \nAn obvious solution to too much oil is to send it up in flames . \n`` People think you just light a match , '' said Stan Jones , spokesman for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council , a commission that monitors tanker and marine safety operations in Prince William Sound and was established by Congress in response to the Exxon Valdez . \n`` Burning 's just not that easy , '' he said . \nSome 15,000 gallons burned in about 75 minutes in one attempt the day after the spill . \nBut others proved futile . \nLittle seemed to be happening the day after the spill , and Exxon panicked at the lack of clear action . \n`` Kick ass and get stuff out there . \nI do n't care what it is . \nI do n't care if it picks up two gallons -LRB- of oil -RRB- a week . \nGet that shit out there and stand it around where people can see it , '' executive Don Cornett said , according to a transcript of an audio tape of Cornett gathered for a 1994 trial on the spill . \nFrustrated fishermen took to the seas , marshaling what they called the `` mosquito fleet '' of skiffs and small boats loaded with buckets and hand-skimmers that launched off a state ferry press-ganged into service . \nThere was no incident command system , the standard hierarchy that is used for responses to natural disasters and is now automatically activated to respond to oil spills . \n`` Early in the oil spill , no one was in charge and everyone was in charge , '' said R.J. Kopchak , a longtime Cordova commercial fisherman and development director for the Prince William Sound Science Center . \n`` It was sort of a spontaneous , grass-roots response where people saw that the oil-company response was n't working , '' said Rick Steiner , a marine scientist and former Cordova fishermen who was part of the effort . \n`` Some boats got booms . \nSome just got buckets . '' \nA salmon fishery was saved and a good 100,000 gallons of oil picked up in the home-made effort . \nExxon coordinated with the group , and Kelso says it shamed the oil giant into action . \nThe oil kept spreading . \nIn four days it was 37 miles from the spill site . \nIn two weeks it was 150 miles . \nBy day 56 , a sheen of crude stretched 470 miles . \nBut two months in , guerrilla warfare had turned into a corporate campaign . \nExxon had mobilized in full . \nSome 11,000 workers were washing rocks , first with rags and then with power hoses . \nThe main plan was to float the oil off the beaches . \nSince oil floats , flooded beaches would shed the oil , which could be caught at the waterline . \nThe main problem was that by this time the oil was tar , stuck to rock , and was n't going to move that easily . \n`` This stuff became much more difficult to deal with plastered on the rocks than it was the first few days . \nand that is what led us to deal with it with the hot water , '' NOAA 's Robinson remembers , describing the decision to rely heavily on high pressure hot water to wash the rocky beaches . \n`` The cleanup in Alaska did n't get started for a couple of months , started in a serious way , '' he said . \n`` We eventually had to have about 10,000 people and several ships and support facilities and all the wherewithal to make hot water and deliver it to the coast . \nAnd that was a couple of months before that arrived , at least , '' he said . \nIt was more than a big effort though . \nIt was a big mistake , Robinson said . \n`` The aggressiveness of the cleanup in the end contributed to more damage than the oil did , '' he believes . \nNine strips of beach were left untouched as an experiment , and those nine beaches look better today than the swept ones , where whatever was alive was cooked to death in superhot water . \nMaki , the Exxon scientist , disagrees . \nBeach denizens -- mussels , clams , worms -- indeed were killed off by the washes , but birds could nest , seals could raise pups on the cleared beaches , sea otters ' chances of survival rose . \n`` When you look at the hot water or warm water wash from a net environmental standpoint for all the species , it was a benefit , '' he said . \nExxon also put fertilizer on beaches far and wide , calculating that naturally existing microbes that eat naturally seeping hydrocarbons would multiply with the fertilizer and munch up the oil , which many said was indeed the case . \nMaki is in the Gulf today , so far as an observer and potentially as a consultant . \nThe differences are stark , he believes . \nDispersants are breaking up the oil far from land , weather has been good , keeping the oil at sea up to now , and the land oil may come to is a different world -- marshes and stretches of white , packed sand that lets oil rest on the surface , not rocks that oil slips down between . \nThat is not to say a white sand beach is easy to clean . \nThe key to such an effort is to wait until all the oil has arrived , skim it and a little sand off with a shovel , and be done . \nBut oil moves with tides , so the perfect time to clean is a moving target . \nVolunteers can easily dig too deep , or not deep enough . \nHeavy equipment works faster but can damage the beach . \nAnd so a simple one-two exercise can become a seemingly endless process that is repeated until there is no beach left . \nMore than 20 years after Valdez , there is hardly any difference in the tools available for cleanup , and very little research has been done to solve the question that divides Robinson and Maki -- what is the least of the evils ? \nThe answers are mostly in studies that Environmental Scientist Nancy Kinner of University of New Hampshire calls ` gray literature ' -- funded by either the oil industry or environmental groups , and thus suspect . \nTake the case of dispersants . \nThere is broad agreement that they can be used in the warm waters of the Gulf , she said , but Alaska ? \n`` I do n't know and I 'm pretty sure from looking at the literature that other people do n't know either . \nThey may they claim they do but again it 's a matter of the quality of these studies , '' said Kinner , who is co-director the Coastal Response Research Center , a joint effort between the university and NOAA . \nFunding for a great new generation of inquiry , studies that would answer , for instance , whether dispersed droplets of oil disappeared or collected in tummies of microbes eaten by shrimp , never happened . \nCongress authorized studies in the 1990 law which followed on the Exxon Valdez disaster , but it never approved the funds to carry out them out , she said . \nOil still lingers on some Alaska beaches , in surprisingly fresh condition . \nNOAA estimates that about 21,000 gallons of oil are buried in beaches . \n`` There 's more oil out there , in larger quantities and in a more toxic state , than we thought there would be , '' said Craig Tillery , Deputy Attorney General of Alaska . \nExxon spent billions on the cleanup , which Erich Gundlach , an engineer who consulted on the Valdez spill , still marvels at . \n`` The line was -- we did n't tell Exxon but -- thank God it was Exxon . \nThe state could n't do it . '' \nCrude from Alaska 's north still comes down the pipeline , and Royal Dutch Shell is on the cusp of drilling exploratory wells in pristine , remote territory of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas . \nToday , a small beach at the end of a narrow cove on Prince William Sound 's Eleanor Island , a site hit heavily by Exxon oil in 1989 , presents an iconic Alaska scene of natural beauty . \nOn a recent visit , a bald eagle flew overhead . \nThe air was scented with kelp , clinging to beach cobbles , and fresh water rushed from a stream in the spruce forest down into the sound . \nSnowy peaks glitter nearby . \nDave Janka has been searching beaches like this for oil since the cleanup was declared officially complete in 1992 . \nHis oldest daughter , who was 3 years old at the time of the spill , wound up riding along while Janka took scientists and others around the sound . \nHe remembers her playing with a toy rod and toy fish . \n`` She 'd bring it up onto the boat and say , ` Oh , it 's dead , it got oil on it , ' '' he said . \nTwo decades of his samples rest in jars on display at the Prince William Sound Science Center , headquartered in a cozy building at the end of a pier in Cordova Harbor , where the local fishing fleet is based . \nOn the recent visit , Janka plunged a shovel into the beach surface . \nGlobs of dark brown oil surrounded by reflective sheen emerged , emitting a headache-inducing odor . \n`` Looks like oil . \nSmells like oil , '' said Janka . \n`` Right from the start of the spill , you did n't want to see it , and then to be here 21 years later and still be seeing it ...

'' \nThey gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for two weeks , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said . \nSurface containment efforts continue , helped by calm seas . \nControlled burns on Thursday removed up to 9,000 barrels -LRB- 280,000 gallons\\/1 ,070,000 liters -RRB- of oil , he said . \nIt `` is a very powerful technique and when the weather is good it will continue , '' Suttles said . \nForecasts suggest light winds through Saturday , although they are expected shift and come from the south to southwest , which could push the slick toward the Louisiana shore . \nAbout 250 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on Friday . \nCrews have laid almost 800,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . \nOn Thursday , after meeting with BP executives in Houston , U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the company and its partners made `` some very major mistakes . '' \nSalazar reiterated the U.S. government will issue no new offshore drilling permits until an inter-agency panel gives a safety review to President Barack Obama by May 28 . \nIn the meantime , current drilling will continue . \nStandard & Poor 's , in announcing the negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely . \nMoody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project . \nS&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill-fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is `` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean-up . '' \nOther companies involved are Transocean , owner of the rig that caught fire and collapsed ; Cameron International , which supplied the failed blow-out preventer for the well ; and Halliburton , which helped cement in place the blown-out well . \nHayward a $ 75 million legal cap on its cleanup and compensation liabilities under federal law , which some U.S. lawmakers now want to raise , would not be a limit for BP . \nBP shares dropped 2.3 percent in London on Friday , less than the broad STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index which fell 3.8 percent . \nIn New York , BP 's American Depository Receipts sank 2.7 percent . \nThe spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster on tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nIt has forced Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . \nAt least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf each day since the well ruptured . \nA sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land . \nSome oiled birds have been found in recent days . \nThe Breton refuge was closed to the public after a silver sheen and emulsified oil reached the shoreline , the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said . \nAltogether , crude from the spill could hit 24 national wildlife refuges . \nA Reuters photographer , on a flyover of the coast , saw a band of oil , orange in color and about a mile or two long , running parallel to shore about 17 miles south of barrier islands off Mississippi 's mainland . \nNumerous black blobs , possibly emulsified tar , were visible just below the surface in shallow water near some marsh coast to the east of the Chandeleur Islands . \nU.S. authorities on Friday modified and expanded the boundaries of the area closed to fishing as a result of the spill , and extended restrictions for another 10 days , to May 17 . \nThe closed area represents almost 4.5 percent of Gulf of Mexico federal waters , up from slightly less than 3 percent included in the original ban . \n`` This oil spill was the last thing we needed , '' Lance Nacio , a shrimper with Anna Marie Seafood in Dulac , Louisiana , said on a call with reporters . \n`` I think this is going to devastate the industry which was already tattered by low dockside prices . '' \nKevin Begos , a seafood industry spokesman in Apalachicola , Florida , said dealers in his area have seen orders drop . \n`` Right now , it 's mostly fear , because oil has n't come here yet , '' Begos said . \nAlabama tourism officials planned an ad campaign to let tourists know the beaches were still clean and encourage them not to cancel their vacation plans . \nFears of massive shipping problems in the Gulf of Mexico have not panned out . \nShippers and ports are prepared to clean vessels that move through the oily waters , but so far ships have passed through without contamination . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI hope that is a special place in hell for corrupt corporations . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "1429", "time": "2010-05-07", "text": "BURAS , Louisiana | Fri May 7 , 2010 3:01 pm EDT BURAS , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - For thousands of fishermen whose livelihoods are threatened by an expanding oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , the offer of jobs by energy giant BP to help clean up the spill seemed like a lifeline . \nBut hope has already turned to disappointment for many in Louisiana and Alabama who complain that too few people are being selected . \nSome also say that out-of-state fishermen are taking advantage of a program designed specifically for locals . \n`` People who have a job -LRB- with BP -RRB- think it 's a good program , but people who do n't , think that it sucks , '' said shrimp fisherman Benjamin Truong whose boat is moored at Buras , a village on the east bank of the Mississippi River . \nOil has been gushing from a BP-owned well at an estimated 5,000 barrels a day since a Deepwater Horizon rig exploded two weeks ago off the Louisiana coast , killing 11 workers . \nAuthorities this week closed affected Gulf of Mexico waters to fishing from the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana to northwest Florida , effectively putting thousands of fishermen out of work at a crucial time in the season . \nMany said they faced immediate financial hardship with mortgages and boat loans to pay . \nThe situation is worse for those still recovering from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , which destroyed boats and homes but also wiped out savings . \nBP 's offer of work to clean up the spill provided a double incentive for fishermen . \nBy helping to contain the slick they would earn much-needed income in addition to speeding the clean-up process so they could return to work . \nEven so , the irony of the situation is not lost on the fishermen , forced to seek temporary jobs with the very company that has put their profession in jeopardy -- and the program itself is ineffective , according to many . \n`` They are putting certain people to work and certain people are just getting the runaround , '' said Johnny Wilson , who signed a contract to work for BP in Venice , Louisiana , but has yet to be selected . \nThere was no immediate response to the complaints , but BP has said it would employ more people as the program gathers steam , and is working to iron out any problems . \nThousands signed contracts in the past week to make themselves and their boats available , and so far 100 people have been given jobs in Louisiana alone in a program that is accelerating , BP spokesman Marti Powers said on Wednesday . \nTwo types of work are on offer : boat owners can earn up to $ 2,000 a day for a vessel over 45 feet , and the company is hiring crews to clean up trash from beaches before the oil strikes , lay protective lines of `` boom '' to keep the oil from spreading into sensitive areas , and other tasks . \n`` It -LRB- the program -RRB- allows us to take advantage of the local knowledge . \nThese fishermen know these waterways better than we do and their boats are very good for this kind of work , '' Powers said . \nThe company has tried to blunt criticism by opening a compensation hotline and deploying staff to participate in meetings with local leaders , such as Plaquemines Parish President Bill Nungesser in Louisiana . \nNungesser and BP community outreach coordinator Dave Kinnaird addressed a town hall meeting in Buras on Thursday for ethnic Vietnamese and Cambodian fishermen . \nIn a measure of the rapport forged with BP since the crisis started , Nungesser told the audience , `` He -LRB- Kinnaird -RRB- has come to express how BP cares for you . '' \nBut fishermen at the meeting complained they felt excluded so far from BP 's jobs program and could not read BP contracts or follow the training course it has provided because they do not speak English . \n`` I just want a chance to go to work and make money , '' said Thoai Tong , a deckhand who has been acting as a translator for Vietnamese fishermen . \nIf the waters do not reopen for fishing , the community will in the long term be forced to move from the area to find fishing elsewhere , he said . \nKinnaird said the fishermen 's concerns would be addressed , and future training sessions and contracts would be translated . \nIn Alabama and Louisiana fishermen reported another problem with the cleanup contracts : outsiders rather than locals were being given jobs . \nBP contractors have passed over local fishermen to hire out-of-state boat crews to lay booms off the coast of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , the heart of that state 's seafood industry , according to local officials . \nHundreds of local fishermen in both states went through more than four hours of hazardous-materials training this week to prepare for temporary work with BP , only to be left waiting for a call that never came , they said . \nInstead , 81 vessels plying Alabama coastal waters under contract with BP for oil-spill containment work all had crews from elsewhere , some from as far away as Maine , said Bayou La Batre Mayor Stan Wright . \n`` Not one is from the state of Alabama , '' Wright said . \n`` I 'm very upset about that . \nThat 's no different than a man coming home for dinner and finding his wife in bed with someone else .

{"id": "968", "time": "2010-06-19", "text": "BURAS , Louisiana | Sat Jun 19 , 2010 7:17 pm EDT BURAS , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Residents of the Gulf Coast battled to save their beaches on Saturday as tar balls washed ashore at Panama City , the most easterly point in Florida where oil has been found from BP Plc 's ruptured deep-sea well . \nBP also restarted its effort to siphon oil spewing from the well in the Gulf of Mexico after the system was shut down for 10 hours to fix a problem with its fire-prevention equipment and to let a storm pass . \nTo try to minimize the leak 's impact , the British energy giant is containing some of the oil as it gushes from well on the sea floor . \nThe system has been `` building up to stable rates since '' it was restarted , BP said in a statement . \nA second siphoning system is also running . \nWord of the latest problem in controlling the leak -- which has caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- came after Anadarko Petroleum Corp , part owner of the well , accused BP of `` reckless '' conduct leading up to the accident . \nSixty-one days after a BP offshore oil rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico , the encroaching oil spill is threatening the coastal economies of four U.S. states including Louisiana , whose fragile wetlands have been hardest hit . \nIn Florida , the Bay County Emergency Operations Center confirmed that tar balls washed onto the beach Panama City , a popular tourist destination , and crews were cleaning them up . \n`` I was out on the water the other day and it was just horrible . \nIt was all over the place . \nThey 've got about a 40 mile slick and about a mile wide just a couple of miles off shore , '' said Danny Proctor , of Destin , Florida , another seaside resort . \nBP said its systems captured 24,500 barrels of oil out of a capacity of 28,000 barrels a day before the shutdown and it hoped to restart the system after a lightning storm passes . \nAnadarko , the owner of a quarter of the ruptured well , has pinned the blame -- and the financial responsibility -- squarely on BP . \n`` There appears to be gross negligence or willful misconduct , '' Houston-based Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett said in an interview that helped to drive his company 's shares up 2.2 percent in after-hours trading on the hopes it could avoid multibillion-dollar liabilities . \nBP said it `` strongly disagrees '' with the accusation of gross negligence but would keep focusing on the oil spill and is working with federal , state and local authorities to try to protect the coastline . \nSo far , Louisiana 's wetlands and its fishing industry have been hardest hit by the spill , but Mississippi , Alabama and parts of Florida 's coast have also been affected . \nLeroy Jones , a sixth-generation oysterman in the south Louisiana fishing port of Buras , said he worries his way of life could be lost as marshes that feed the oyster beds are contaminated . \n`` It 's wild ... It feels like 100 pounds of stress is added every day , '' he said as he painted his boat instead of fishing . \nOn the job , he makes as much as $ 1,700 a day from oysters . \nCompensation checks from BP are a fraction of that . \nThe new federal administrator of a fund to pay for damages , Kenneth Feinberg , said it would be a `` horror '' if BP went bankrupt , but the $ 20 billion fund agreed to by BP under pressure from the White House could be increased if it proves insufficient . \nPresident Barack Obama has seen his popularity slip over his handling of the spill and lawmakers in Washington used congressional hearings with BP to gather ammunition ahead of November elections . \nBP 's chief executive Tony Hayward was conspicuously absent from a gathering of global oil industry leaders on Saturday in St Petersburg , Russia , where his company 's woes were a constant topic of discussion . \nResidents and local officials see costs skyrocketing with the crippling of the multibillion dollar Gulf fishing industry , a deep water oil drilling moratorium and growing environmental destruction along the coast . \n`` I think it 's going to go over $ 100 billion , '' said Brian Miguez , a food service salesman from New Orleans , at his vacation property in Grand Isle , Louisiana , where the spill has forced the closure and cleanup of six miles of sandy beach . \n`` They have n't even felt the wrath of the lawsuits that are going to come in , '' he said . \nBP is seeking up to $ 7 billion in loans from seven banks , banking sources told Reuters . \nThe sources said BP may offer up to $ 10 billion in debt as early as next week . \nIts debt is now trading at junk levels , and Moody 's has cut its rating three notches on concerns about spill liabilities . \nMoments after Anadarko said BP would have to pay all claims , After falling 6.8 percent in a volatile week driven by Washington politics , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . \nThe first of a pair of relief wells meant to stop the oil flow in August is within 200 feet of the side of the blown well , said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production . \nBut it must be drilled farther before it can intersect with the blown well . \nBP is capturing record amounts of crude but Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said 35,000 barrels a day , and possibly as much as 60,000 barrels , are pouring from the well , which exploded on April 20 killing 11 workers . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nMajor funders of Bush 's oil deregulation frenzy . \nNot innocent , not by a long shot . \nThis reminds me of the tobacco industry shakedown in which the government sued the tobacco industry for billions in damages on behalf of smokers . \nSmokers and ex-smokers never got a dime of that money . \nI hope the gulf coast fishermen fare better than smokers did but I think the money will probably just be funneled to the states and it will then disappear and the fishermen will be left holding empty nets . \nThis `` spill '' is enormous and the lawyer-up of the BP executives may actually be as big a crisis . \nFor us `` small people '' who have to rely upon the oil companies to supply us with the oils and gas we regretfully need it is right for us to expect from them a fair shake and from the government a proper oversight of the technical issues surrounding the drilling and manufacturing of the oil products . \nThere has been a breakdown totally across the industrial-government divide , a corrupted state where the money talked and the narrow minded self serving twits who were in positions of authority put all risk aside for their personal gain . \nTo say `` golden parachute '' is a vast understatement because millions will be paid in lawyer fees to keep them out of jail . \nIt is a tragedy for all involved . \nSo the escrow fund is a good thing , but I would go further and extend this `` idea '' to all of the oil companies doing business in the USA . \nMy point -- when is the last time you filled up at a gas station and actually tried to use a restroom if one was available -- think about that . \nSome are quite clean and functional most terrible and many not existent or allowed as seen in Maryland too much . \nNow when was the last time you were at a National Park and used the restroom . \nAmazing is n't it that in that domain the restroom facilities are examples -- well lets make them just that and throw that into the `` JOBS '' category that spills out of the oil spill rebuild issue . \nOil companies and their affiliates run around 1200 to 1500 gas stations each in the USA and most could use significant upgrades in public restrooms , the actual grounds , access paths , and walk ways around the station and the curbs , parking area and entrances to the station complex itself . \nI contend that an additional $ 250,000 a year to each of these stations would only eat up a few billion of oil company resources and could be written off tax wise . \nMeanwhile , taking the New Jersey example people -- untrained people -- would be hired an trained to serve the pumps -LRB- not full service by required service -RRB- and a permanent maintenance and cleanup crew that would place every station in the class of restroom quality as the National park system -- approximately a team of 12 people working in shifts . \nThinks about it -- a real plus to all of us , jobs and work for local construction companies ... and we

'' \n`` There 's really a substance here that matters , '' Emanuel added . \n`` That 's clearly a PR mistake , but he 's made a number of those mistakes . \nWhat 's important is : are we capping the well ? \nAre we capturing the oil ? \nAre we containing the cleanup ? \nAre we filing the claims ? \nAre we also cleaning up the mess ? \nThat 's what 's important . '' \nOpinion about Hayward 's attendance at the race was mixed among residents of the U.S. Gulf Coast , hard hit by the spill . \n`` You 've got to think about all the fish that are dying out there , all the birds that are dying ... and that 's going to never come back , '' said Venice , Louisiana resident , Wilma Buras . \n`` So Hayward going out was n't the best way ... absolutely not .

{"id": "557", "time": "2010-06-19", "text": "GRAND ISLE , Louisiana | Sat Jun 19 , 2010 4:18 pm EDT GRAND ISLE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Those on the front lines of the Gulf Coast oil spill say they are forced to fight two battles -- one against the crude washing into lush wetlands and another against needless bureaucracy . \nSixty-one days after the BP Plc well began spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico , angry local officials blame dozens of federal agencies involved in approving response plans , a maze of regulations and poor coordination for their struggles beating back the slick . \n`` My experience has been frustration , too much red tape , no a sense of urgency . \nFor the state and the coastal parishes that are directly affected to put forth a plan , you have to kick and scream every step of the way to get it approved , '' said John Young , council chairman for Jefferson Parish in Louisiana . \n`` The president said it 's a war . \nI agree we 're under siege , but if it was a war , we 'd be occupied territory now . '' \nIt is time for President Barack Obama 's administration to appoint an `` oil spill czar '' to streamline operations for the 31,000 people fighting the worst spill in U.S. history and avoid the costly delays , Young said as he prepared to board a boat to tour his region 's fouled wetlands . \nAs a guide , many point to the arrival of U.S. Army General Russel Honore in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \nThe tough-talking military man was credited with taking control and kick-starting the city 's stalled rescue mission in the weeks after the storm . \nLast week , the U.S. Coast Guard shut down 16 vacuum barges that were sucking up crude from Louisiana marshes . \nThe units , which consist of trucks and tanks on barges that suck up thousands of gallons of crude , needed to be checked for stability and if they had life jackets and fire extinguishers . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal had asked officials to inspect them quickly without bringing them back to dock . \nBut the units sat idle for 24 hours before being allowed to travel back to oil-fouled Barataria Bay , Bay Jimmy and Pass A Loutre . \nAfter 24 hours , the barges went back to work , and according to media reports , no inspections were performed . \nOn Friday , the Coast Guard shut down two more barges , prompting Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser to make an angry call the White House , which ordered them back into operation , his office said . \nMeanwhile , the oil keeps gushing into the Gulf at a rate now estimated as high as 60,000 barrels a day . \nJindal has blasted a lack of coordination between federal departments overseeing the fight and state and local officials waging it . \n`` It is frustrating because it does n't seem like the left hand knows what the right hand is doing , '' he said recently . \n`` There is no streamlined system here . \nThis is why we keep stressing that we need to see more of a sense of urgency from the Coast Guard , federal officials and BP . '' \nFor its part , the Coast Guard said it supported the barge project , but had to ensure their safety . \nThe incidents followed a weeks-long effort by state and local officials to have a plan approved to construct sand berms to protect barrier islands from encroaching oil , an effort that is expected to cost $ 360 million . \nYoung said he supported a military-style chain of command where someone at the top has the power the make quick decisions putting response plans into action and making sure that crews have the equipment they need . \n`` Absolutely -- one person . \nMaybe they need an escrow account for that . \nGet one military person who knows the chain of command to get things done , because this is a war-type situation , '' Young said . \n`` We ca n't be deciding and executing by committee because it 's just not getting done .

{"id": "1695", "time": "2010-05-01", "text": "-- Riki Ott , PhD , has written two books on the Exxon Valdez oil spill impacts on people , communities , and wildlife , including the recently released Not One Drop : Betrayal and Courage in the Wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill . \nAny views expressed here are her own . \n-- I remember the words , We ve had the Big One , with chilling clarity , spoken just over 21 years ago when a fellow fisherman arrived at my door in the early morning and announced that the Exxon Valdez had run aground in Alaska s Prince William Sound and was gushing oil . \nFor the small fishing community of Cordova , Alaska , where I lived and worked as a commercial fisherma am , it was our worst nightmare . \nThat nightmare is reoccurring now with BP s deadly rig blowout off the Gulf Coast with haunting parallels to the Exxon Valdez . \nI was not at all surprised when officials reported zero spillage , then projected modest spillage , and then reported spill amounts five times higher than their earlier estimates . \nAs the spill continues , I imagine that even the newly reported amounts will continue to vastly underestimate the actual spillage . \nUnderreporting of spill volumes is common , even though lying about self-reported spill volume is illegal and a breach of public trust . \nStill , penalties are based on spill volume : Exxon likely saved itself several billion dollars by sticking with its low-end estimate of 11 million gallons and scuttling its high-end estimate of 38 million gallons , later validated by independent surveyors . \nSadly , it s a foregone conclusion that BP s promise to do everything we can to minimize the spill s impact and stop the oil still hemorrhaging from the well nearly one mile under the sea off Louisiana s coast will fade as its attention turns to minimizing its liability , including damaged public relations . \nBP will likely leverage the billions of dollars it will spend on the cleanup to reduce its fines and lawsuit expenses , despite later recouping a large portion of the cleanup cost from insurers or writing it off as a business expense as Exxon did . \nSuch tactics saved Exxon billions of dollars in the civil settlement for damages to public lands and wildlife -LRB- in which damages were estimated at up to $ 8 billion ; but for which Exxon paid just $ 900 million -RRB- and in the class action lawsuit filed by those whose livelihoods were curtailed by the spill -LRB- for which the original jury awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages ; but which Exxon fought for 20 years until the Supreme Court lessened its burden to just $ 507 million -RRB- . \nThat Supreme Court decision strictly limited corporate liability and essentially removed the ability of future oil spill victims to hold corporations accountable to the people and the law . \nA friend in New Orleans is concerned about the oil fumes now engulfing the southern part of town . \nHe says it smells pretty strong -- stronger than standing in a busy mechanics shop , but not as bad as the bus station in Tijuana . \nState health officials are warning people who are sensitive to reduced air quality to stay indoors , but anyone who experiences the classic symptoms of crude oil overexposure -- nausea , vomiting , headaches , or cold or flu-like symptoms -- should seek medical help . \nThis is serious : Oil spill cleanups are regulated as hazardous waste cleanups because oil is , in fact , hazardous to health . \nBreathing oil fumes is extremely harmful . \nAfter the 2002 Prestige oil spill off Galicia , Spain , and the 2007 Hebei Spirit oil spill in South Korea , medical doctors found fishermen and cleanup workers suffered from respiratory problems , central nervous system problems -LRB- headaches , nausea , dizziness , etc. -RRB- , and even genetic damage -LRB- South Korea -RRB- . \nI have attended two international conferences the past two years to share information with these doctors . \nDuring the Exxon Valdez spill , health problems among cleanup workers became so widespread , so fast , that medical doctors , among others , sounded warnings . \nDr. Robert Rigg , former Alaska medical director for Standard Alaska -LRB- BP -RRB- , warned , It is a known fact that neurologic changes -LRB- brain damage -RRB- , skin disorders -LRB- including cancer -RRB- , liver and kidney damage , cancer of other organ systems , and medical complications -- secondary to exposure to working unprotected in -LRB- or inadequately protected -RRB- -- can and will occur to workers exposed to crude oil and other petrochemical by-products . \nWhile short-term complaints , i.e. , skin irritation , nausea , dizziness , pulmonary symptoms , etc. , may be the initial signs of exposure and toxicity , the more serious long-term effects must be prevented . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- Unfortunately , Exxon called the short-term symptoms , the Valdez Crud , and dismissed 6,722 cases of respiratory claims from cleanup workers as colds or flu using an exemption under OSHA s hazardous waste cleanup reporting requirements . \n-LRB- 2 -RRB- Sadly , sick Exxon cleanup workers were left to suffer and pay their own medical expenses . \nI know of many who have been disabled by their illnesses or have died . \nI have repeatedly warned Congress in letters and in person to strike that loophole because it exempts the very work-related injuries chemical induced illnesses that OSHA is supposedly designed to protect workers from . \nRemember the Katrina Crud and the 911 Crud ? \nStandby for the Gulf Crud because our federal laws do not adequately protect worker safety or public health from the very real threat of breathing oil vapors , including low levels typically found in our industrial ports , our highways during rush hour traffic , and our urban cities . \nOil is not only harmful to people , it is deadly to wildlife . \nI am sickened to think of the short-term destruction and long-term devastation that will happen along America s biologically rich coastal wetlands a national treasure and a regional source of income . \nIn Alaska , the killing did not stop in 1989 . \nTwenty-one years later , buried oil is still contaminating wildlife and Prince William Sound has not returned to pre-spill conditions nor , honestly , will it . \nThe remnant population of once-plentiful herring no longer supports commercial fisheries and barely sustains the ecosystem . \nWhile local efforts to boom Louisiana s fragile coasts to keep the oil out will help people feel productive and empowered -LRB- and this is important -RRB- , it is an unfortunate truth that the booms have limited utility and effectiveness . \nIn even mild sea conditions , oil will wash over and under boom . \nFurther , underneath the visible oil slick , there is an invisible cloud of toxic oil dissolved into the water column and this dissolved oil is deadly to shrimp and fish eggs and marine life . \nStill , the Gulf spill has one advantage over the Alaska spill hot weather and the relatively warm ocean will speed the work of bacteria to degrade the Louisiana crude . \nEven so , the initial toxic hit is likely to harm generations of wildlife , similar to what happened in Prince William Sound . \nThe oil industry has had over 40 years since the 1967 Torrey Canyon tanker spill in England to make good on its promise to cleanup future oil spills . \nThis latest spill highlights the harsh truth that the industry has failed to live up to its promise . \nIt is time for Americans to demand of our leaders accountability and closure of fossil fuel industries as we transition to new energies . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- City of Cordova Fact Sheet , 1989 1 -LRB- 29 -RRB- : Robert Rigg , MD ,

considered a threat to our homeland security . \nWhat is the emergency plan required to carry out for just such a disaster ? \nThis MUST be considered before granting BP the permits to construct this rig . \nAnd I 'm not just talking about the costs in dollars . \nHistory showes the fact that capitalism is in the pat of distruction , but did some one say that we got to learn from history ! \nCurrently humanity is lost and can not understand anything but monitary relationship which has turn workers to modern slaves , which even can not earn a very simple life with capitalist standards .

, it will be a mess for a few months but , unlike Alaska , the Gulf of Mexico is in a hot climate with hurricanes . \nAs soon as the leak is stopped , oil eating bacteria will gain the upper hand and , before you know it , no trace of oil will remain . \nA million barrels of oil have been leaking into the Gulf from natural oil seeps each year for millions of years . \nPick up some BP stock after it finishes tanking , and you will make a lot of money in 6 years when peak oil hits and it goes way , way up . \nIf you want to get all upset and worried about something , peak oil is it . \nrikki

ratifications to their nervous system and toxicology in their bodies i live with long term exposures and chronic pain due to exposure of oil based products i pray that this does n't turn out like the valdez -LRB- real smart idea buy some bp stock unlike Exxon bp is not an American company so it will be much tougher to buy off the courts and it is n't a small community fighting a giant corporation all those spring break beaches will be hit along with the devastation of the heart and soul of the gulf in the delta and with the knowledge and passion of rikki ott i am sure she will provide many

discusses the `` tactics '' Exxon used to reduce its legal and financial liability after the Valdez incident and how BP will likely follow the same damage control path . \nThe language the author uses makes the reader draw the conclusion that these `` tactics '' are somehow underhanded , dirty , and possibly illegal . \nUnfortunately , Exxon , and now BP , are and will continue to play by the rules , stretching the boundaries of existing laws and policies . \nTo insinuate these companies are somehow underhanded for toeing the line and doing everything possible to work in the best interest of the company\\/shareholders , despite the public tragedy they have caused , is ridiculous . \nIf the public -LRB- or this author -RRB- does n't like the laws and policies regulating oil companies , work to change them . \nDo n't put these companies in a negative light for playing off the shortcomings in the ` rulebook ' . \nI know it can be cleaned up . \nMinimizing the additional flow to the slick is what concerns me . \nI would be interested in the size of the reservoir tht this is tapped into and the pressure . \nI would expect that any other deep water rigs would be shut down until a safe way can be determined to operate these rigs . \nI 've drilled in 5000 feet of water off the Louisiana coast . \nIt 's very technical , very expensive , and very dangerous -LRB- both to men and machines -RRB- . \nI was offshore for five hurricanes from 1975 to 1980 . \nThe people that do those jobs are very professional . \nMy question is `` Why did n't the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- operate as designed ? '' \nWas there a communication failure between the wellhead and the surface ? \nIn Alaska the shoreline effected by the spill was about 10 feet deep , If the spill hits the marsh , where the shore is 10 miles deep , then this spill could be thousands of times as destructive . \nP.S. BP is already handing out all inclusive damage waivers to the fishermen helping with the spill , offering $ 5000 to quit all claims and future claims against BP . \nBP has been asked to stop , as such an all inclusive waiver is illegal . \nNow that 's what I call taking responsebility . \na documentary about the Valdez oil spill is airing on the green channel called black wave on Sunday may 9th 12 ; 00 am and 3 ; 00am central time it is airing on the green channel 194 for dish viewers it is a much need to watch show about the ramifications of oil spills IT IS GREAT thanks raymond stawski Only 4 % of the Valdez contamination was removed . \nThe rest is now on the floor of the water there . \ni reread all the post about rikki ott and her quest for tight regulations in the oil and gas industry the may 2 post at 12 ; 15 was about laws and stretching the law my question is WHY DOES A COMPANY HAVE TO STRETCH THE LAW TO ITS MAXIMUM FOR THEIR OWN INTEREST AND SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST . \nWHY NOT BE THE GOOD GUY AND DO WHATS RIGHT FOR ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED . \nDO N'T STRETCH THE LAW -LRB- THAT 'S WHY NEW LAWS ARE CREATED -RRB- i am sorry i pressed a wrong button and sent this last post out while i edited MY OTHER MAIN POINT WAS DOES ANY AVERAGE PERSON KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO CHANGE , CREATE , OR HOLD UP AN EXISTING LAW . \npeople have dedicated their lives and many years to change injustices or just trying to explain to people an ignorance IN A PARTICULAR LAW , AND THEN TO TAKE ON LOBBYIST PAC GROUP , GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY IT IS MIND BOGGLING THE HOOP JUMPING AND TIME IT TAKES . \nEVEN IF IT IS A TINY LAW TO JUST PUT IN A DRIVEWAY OR DIG A POND ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY TRUST ME IT TAKES YEARS SOMETIMES THANKS RAYMOND STAWSKI I have some concerns ...

{"id": "758", "time": "2010-05-01", "text": "LOS ANGELES | Sat May 1 , 2010 3:36 am EDT LOS ANGELES -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The first known wildlife casualty of the massive oil spill threatening the U.S. Gulf Coast was a single Northern Gannet seabird , found alive but coated in the toxic grime creeping ashore along Louisiana 's coast . \nThat bird , recovered offshore on Friday and taken to an emergency rehabilitation center to be cleaned up and nursed back to health , is only the tip of a potential calamity facing the region 's birds , sea turtles and marine mammals . \nBesides the rescued Gannet , and several sperm whales seen swimming in and around the oil slick earlier , no `` confirmed animal impacts '' have been reported , yet , Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian overseeing some of the wildlife rescue teams in the region , said in a telephone interview from Houma , Louisiana . \nBut , he added soberly : `` That is not going to stay the same . \nWe are expecting many more -LRB- casualties -RRB- in the days to come . \nWe hope that number is not catastrophic . \nWe 're ... hoping for the best but planning for the worst . '' \nZiccardi is director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network in California , a hub for the world 's leading experts in capturing and caring for oil-soaked sea life . \nHe knows from responding to more than 60 oil spills in California that the full scope of harm to birds and other wildlife only becomes apparent once the oil washes ashore . \nOil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured deepwater well off Louisiana , pouring into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of up to 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons or 955,000 liters -RRB- a day since last week , and so far efforts plug the leaks have failed . \nAs of Friday , the giant slick in the gulf had just begun to make landfall on barrier islands of the Mississippi River Delta off Louisiana . \nZiccardi said the risk to bird species would grow as the spill progressed . \nOil impairs the insulating properties of birds ' feathers , exposing them to cold and making it difficult for them to float , swim and fly . \nChemicals in the petroleum also can burn their skin and irritate their eyes . \nThey also end up ingesting the oil when they preen , damaging their digestive tracts . \nSimilarly , oil can be ingested by turtles and marine mammals , burn their skin and eyes and cause respiratory damage when fumes are inhaled . \nHow high a toll the gulf spill takes on wildlife hinges on several factors that have yet to play out , including the weather , how much of the slick can be contained and how soon crippled undersea well spewing oil can be capped . \n`` It 's really only going to be clear in the coming days because there are a lot of unknowns , '' said Paul Kelway , a regional manager of the International Bird Rescue Research Center , which sent a team to Louisiana . \n`` All we can do is prepare these -LRB- rescue -RRB- facilities and get staff trained and be ready to help , '' he said in California . \nThe spill has come at an especially bad time for the region 's bird life . \nThe Mississippi Flyway is a key migratory corridor that runs through the area , said Ziccardi , a professor at the University of California at Davis who wrote the U.S. federal guidelines for rescuing wildlife in oil spills . \n`` There are certain songbirds and shorebirds that are going through their peak migratory period , '' he said . \n`` There are other birds for which this is a nesting and egg-laying period . '' \nThe oil-coated Northern Gannet , a sea bird with striking black and white plumage that feeds by plunge-diving for fish and squid , was found in the water . \nBut because most birds tend to stay fairly close to land , they are most vulnerable once the oil washes ashore . \n`` With turtles and marine mammals , they 're out in the open water , so they are at risk earlier , '' Ziccardi said . \nTurtles may be particularly hard hit because many have just started nesting or are close to doing so in the gulf . \nAs for marine mammals in the region , some studies have found that dolphins and whales tend to go out of their way to avoid oil spills , while the sperm whales seen swimming around the slick suggest otherwise . \nZiccardi said , however , that the large presence of boats and planes in cleanup operations `` are a wonderful deterrent '' in keeping animals out of the danger zone , `` so that has a double advantage for us . '' \nSome experts have raised the possibility that prolonged difficulty in halting the oil flow from the BP-owned well could lead to an environmental disaster on the scale of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , in which an estimated 250,000 seabirds perished . \nBut Ziccardi said that even if that happens , the mortality level for birds along the Gulf Coast may be smaller . \n`` We do n't have the same densities of sea birds in this area as Prince William Sound , '' he said . \n`` But that 's not to say that if the spill continues and birds are affected , we wo n't have sizable losses Ziccardi arrived in Louisiana on Thursday to manage rescue efforts for the five threatened and endangered species of sea turtles in harm 's way , along with manatees , dolphins and other marine mammals . \nKelway 's group and another from Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research in Delaware are overseeing bird rescues . \nThey will be relying on teams of trained professionals and volunteers who specialize in capturing , transporting and rehabilitating animals injured by oil spills . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe oil is known to have affected an estimated 90 miles of shoreline , numerous bird species , and recreational use of the bay , such as shell fishing and boating . \nWe need to review the George Stephanopoulos interview the other day in which the Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary E.

'' \nWith the oil slick still growing , the full cost of the cleanup and the damages will not be known for some time , according to Brent Coon , a Texas lawyer representing a Transocean worker who survived the April 20 explosion , as well as others in the area whose livelihoods are affected by the spill . \n`` In this kind of case , there 's usually some blame to pass around , '' said Coon , who previously represented victims in the BP Texas City refinery blast . \nAnadarko Petroleum , BP 's partner in the well with a 25 percent stake , is also on the hook for some clean-up liability , although the Woodlands , Texas company was quick to say it did not make any operational mistakes . \nChief Executive Officer Jim Hackett told investors this week his company had nothing to do with the well design or operating procedures and came in only at the end of planning to approve the project 's budget . \n-LRB- ID : nN04102706 -RRB- Still , the company was expecting the different parties to begin trading accusations as the facts of the accident came to light . \n`` There 's going to be a lot of fingers pointing in a lot of different ways , '' Robert Reeves , Anadarko 's general counsel said on a conference call on Wednesday . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt just shows that BP 's ability to check the process sucks and it means that all the righs should be checked . \nAlso , there where a lot of other spills on BP rigs . \nHave n't they learned anything besides blaming others ? \nThey should nationalise BP and use the future proceeds to make good of al the damages made ! \nStop drilling at all you dont have to do that in the future . \nUse solar thermal power plants like Chevron is doing as fuel replacers or build wind power as fuel savers . \nPV is maybe to waek ...

'' \n`` The government 's unchecked authority has shut down this entire industry , '' argued lawyer Carl Rosenblum , representing the oil industry . \nThe lawsuit is the first seeking to reverse Obama 's May 28 moratorium , which the companies say will force job cuts in the labor force needed to service offshore oil platforms . \nThe ban has caused the shutdown of 33 deepwater drilling rigs . \nObama imposed the ban after an explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 killed 11 workers and ruptured a well owned by BP Plc , unleashing millions of gallons of crude into the ocean . \nThe Obama administration argues that the moratorium is necessary to prevent further accidents while a presidential commission investigates the cause of the BP spill . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a Republican critic of the Obama administration 's handling of the spill , has sided with the companies in the case . \nThe lawsuit is another example of the administration 's strained relations with big business , which was on display last week when BP bowed to pressure from Obama and agreed to set up a $ 20 billion oil spill damages fund . \nThe spill , now in its 63rd day , has soiled the coastline of four U.S. states , threatening tourism and fishing industries ; seeped into ecologically sensitive wetlands and marshes ; battered BP 's image ; and tested Obama , who has come under fire over his handling of the crisis . \nIf spill spreads , BP could face challenges beyond the Gulf Coast . \nAttorneys general from 11 states on the U.S. East Coast warned they would hold the company responsible for injury to wildlife that could affect their coastline . \nAn independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents -- the U.S. Chemical Safety Board -- is launching a probe into the root causes of the spill . \nThe case will be handled by the investigators who examined BP 's safety practices after a deadly 2005 refinery explosion in Texas . \nBP said it has spent $ 2 billion so far on clean-up . \nFueling investor concern about BP 's final bill for the spill , a Democratic U.S. lawmaker on Sunday released an internal company document that said , in a worst-case scenario , up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil a day could gush from its ruptured deep-sea well . \nThe British energy company dismissed it , saying the figure was being taken out of context . \nBut investors , apparently worried it could mean higher fines and clean-up costs for BP , drove its shares down 4.5 percent in New York trading . \nBP plans to raise cash from banks to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay for the clean-up but does not plan a bond offering , sources familiar with the company 's thinking told Reuters on Monday . \nBanking sources said last week that BP was seeking some $ 7 billion from banks . \nBP has considered several ways to raise more money , such as selling assets . \nBut for now , it is confident its cash resources can cover the bulk of the clean-up costs , one source said . \nSeeking to keep the focus on the ecological disaster , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu hosted mayors from 17 U.S. cities on a visit to the Mississippi Delta , where oil has coated fragile marshlands , tarred wildlife and decimated fisheries . \nDuring the mayors ' visit to marshes in Louisiana 's Barataria Bay , the stench of coagulating oil hung in the air as miles of boom encircled oil-stained marshes and scores of boats skimmed oil from the bay 's waters . \nBP continued to siphon more oil from the blown-out deep-sea well . \nIt said it collected or burned off 23,290 barrels -LRB- 978,180 gallons\\/3 .7 million liters -RRB- of crude on Sunday , still well below the 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day that government scientists estimate are gushing from the well . \nBoth BP and the U.S. government are placing their hopes on two relief wells that are being drilled to permanently cap the leak . \nThose wells are expected to be finished in August . \nBP Managing Director Bob Dudley is in day-to-day charge of the company 's response to the spill after Chief Executive Tony Hayward returned to Britain last week , the company said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nExecutives only understand costs , not human suffering . \nHit them with severe penalties , and if someone in Congress objects , publicize it loudly . \nshould consider a fact that is being ignored : Louisianans - because of its royalty payments from oil and gas has the lowest property taxes in the U.S. for fourty plus years . \nSince they did not share that income with other states and the citizens of Texas and Louisiana certainly supported their oil industry benefactors as evidenced by the Joe Barton 's ; I '' shed my tears for the fish !!

'' \nBut waves as high as 12 feet would delay hooking up a third system to capture oil , he said . \nIn London , BP said Tony Hayward was still its CEO , with no change under discussion , after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said he expected the embattled boss to resign soon and Moscow to be told the name of his successor on Monday . \nAdding credence to BP 's statement , Sechin 's office said later that management changes were not raised when he met Hayward , who has been criticized over his response to the disaster and was in Russia to address Moscow 's worries about BP 's local operations in the leak 's wake . \nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center said Alex was expected to become a hurricane on Tuesday , with winds of 96-110 mph by late on Wednesday before striking near the Texas-Mexico border and moving inland . \nShell shut subsea production at two platforms and BP evacuated some personnel from three platforms due to the threat of Alex , the companies said on Sunday . \nFlorida officials said swells churned up by Alex would hinder clean-up operations . \n`` Over the next several days the winds and current are going to hamper some offshore operations and the current is going to be pushing things more onto shore , '' said state meteorologist Amy Godsey . \nWhile a hurricane could also interrupt BP 's efforts to cap the well , some specialists say the heavy weather could actually help mitigate environmental damage by dispersing the oil . \nU.S.-listed shares of BP rose about 3 percent in morning trade on Monday , the first session after a sell-off that sent the stock to a 14-year low , but faded in the afternoon to close just 0.3 percent higher . \nThe shares , a staple of pension funds , have lost more than half of their value since the spill began two months ago and are down some 24 percent since the start of June . \nThe New York Fed has been probing exposure to BP to ensure Wall Street and the global financial system would not be at risk if the oil giant buckles under the costs of the spill , according to two sources familiar with the matter . \nAfter poring over documents and asking banks about their exposure to BP over the past two weeks , the New York Fed found no systemic risk and had not asked firms to alter their credit relationships with BP , the sources told Reuters . \n`` The Fed gave banks ' exposure to BP a passing grade , '' said one of the sources on condition of anonymity . \nBeyond 's BP survival prospects , the examination underscores market uncertainty about how the spill 's staggering clean-up bill might affect Wall Street , a fragile economic recovery and the multitrillion-dollar energy market . \nBP said on Monday its spending to cap the well , clean up the spill and compensate those affected had accelerated to $ 100 million a day , bringing the total so far to $ 2.65 billion . \nThe company has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund under U.S. government pressure . \nKenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator of the fund , has said it made `` absolutely no sense '' to drive BP into bankruptcy , while promising to streamline the claims process and even let some victims file online . \nBP 's earlier handling of compensation on its own came under fire as unduly bureaucratic and time-consuming . \nFeinberg expressed doubt on Monday that compensation could stretch as far as a New Orleans strip club that says it has lost business because the fishermen who are its customers are out of work due to the spill . \n`` I do n't think they 'll get money out of this fund , '' he said in an interview with Fox News , adding the $ 20 billion `` should be reserved for the most directly impacted claims . '' \nWhile Alex remained at a safe distance , people in southeastern Louisiana had more immediate concerns as lightning lit up the sky and a torrent of rain flooded roads . \nSome residents were also concerned about BP and the Coast Guard 's continued use of chemical dispersants . \nOn Monday , crews sprayed the material far offshore using airplanes . \nDispersants help oil dissolve within months , breaking it down into small particles that can be easily digested by organisms living in the Gulf . \nBut they are controversial as the long-term health implications are not clear . \nThe Environmental Protective Agency is studying the use of dispersants . \n`` They should stop using them , '' said Mary Tompkins of Nairn , Louisiana . \nNalco , the company that makes the primary dispersant being used , Corexit , says the product is safe in the environment . \n`` I do n't believe that , '' Tompkins said . \n`` They need to stop .

{"id": "811", "time": "2010-05-30", "text": "VENICE , Louisiana | Sun May 30 , 2010 7:23 pm EDT VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Lawmakers and local residents clamored on Sunday for BP and the Obama administration to do more to save the Gulf Coast from an out-of-control oil spill that has become the biggest environmental catastrophe in the country 's history . \nOne congressman called the nearly six-week oil gush in the Gulf of Mexico an `` environmental crime , '' while a Louisiana senator demanded BP invest $ 1 billion immediately to protect the region 's treasured marshlands . \nThe failure on Saturday of a `` top kill '' technique attempted by London-based BP to try to seal its leaking Gulf well has unleashed a surge of anger and frustration that poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama . \nObama , who has called the leaking BP well a `` man-made disaster , '' is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill , now known to be the worst in U.S. history . \nHe is in a bind because it appears only BP can stop the leak , although he has made clear the government is in charge . \nBut critics say he has not directed enough resources to the unfolding disaster and he has been present enough . \nThe White House said on Sunday that the government will triple clean-up resources in areas affected by the spill , while the administration 's top energy and environment officials head back to the Gulf this week following Obama 's second visit on Friday . \n`` This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \nBP , its reputation and market value already battered by the catastrophic spill , and the entire U.S. oil industry face more probing questions about why safety backups did not accompany their pursuit of oil in ever deeper offshore waters . \n`` I think without question if the word criminal should be used in terms of an environmental crime against our country , that what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico is going to qualify , '' U.S. Representative Ed Markey told CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' \nDepartment of Justice officials are part of an ongoing federal investigation into the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the spill , and the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of a criminal prosecution . \nIn Louisiana , which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far , local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up outlying sandbanks and islets . \n`` I 'm devastated ... We are dying a slow death , every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , where the oil has clogged wetlands . \n`` Even the government seems powerless and all the experts . \nIf these people ca n't stop it , then who in the name of God can ? '' \nFather Gerry , a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulphur , Louisiana , said , his voice heavy with emotion . \n` OIL COMING UP UNTIL AUGUST ' After giving up on Saturday an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to `` kill '' it , BP is pursuing another option from its undersea toolbox . \nBut BP warns that the new procedure , which will try to fit a containment cap over the leaking well , could take between four and seven days . \nEven then success is not guaranteed because it has never been attempted before at the depth -- a mile down -- where the oil is leaking . \nBP Managing Director Robert Dudley told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' the company would know by the end of the week whether the new containment effort worked . \nThe next BP step would involve undersea robots using diamond-rimmed saws to cut off a pipe over the well to put in place a containment device that would try to siphon off most of the leaking oil and gas up to a tanker ship on the surface . \nDudley said he did not think BP CEO Tony Hayward , who has faced heavy criticism , should be forced to resign . \nA surer solution to the leak , a relief well already being drilled , is not expected to be finished until early August . \nThis means crude oil continues to spew out daily , feeding a huge , fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana . \n`` There could be oil coming up until August . '' \nBrowner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' `` We are prepared for the worst . '' \nLouisiana Senator Mary Landrieu called on BP to immediately invest $ 1 billion to protect marshes , wetlands and estuaries across the region . \n`` While we may not be able to plug the leaking well right away , there is nothing that should stop us from getting help to the Gulf Coast immediately , '' she said . \nGulf residents fear the spilled oil could be whipped further inshore by what promises to be the most active Atlantic storm season since 2005 , the year of Hurricane Katrina . \nThat deadly storm proved a political disaster for President George W. Bush , who was accused of complacency in handling it , and Obama is fighting to prevent the Gulf spill from becoming his own `` Katrina '' ahead of the November congressional elections . \nLouisianans still recovering from Katrina 's devastation were frustrated by the oil spill response . \n`` It 's been a screw-up from day one . \nNothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond , '' said Claude Marquette , a retired physician , 68 , speaking as he sat with his wife in his boat . \nBP 's Hayward had predicted that despite risks , the `` top kill '' had a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . \nHe said he did not know why it failed to stop the gusher . \nThe misstep is likely to drive his credibility lower , along with his company 's market value , which has dropped by 25 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , and triggering the spill . \nThe government estimated last week that 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the well . \nAt that rate , the government now knows that the Gulf disaster has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan waters . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n-LRB- As I am trying to communicate to BP\\/the US to see if it is legitimate -RRB- : 1 . \nClear debris , rock , mud , etc from gushing pipe . \nStrong vice grips as wide as the pipe diameter squeeze the pipe shut as absolutely as much as possible . \nSolder and Meld the Pipe Shut , from one end of the crease to the other , and Reinforce the Closure . \nDo for all open pipes . \nUse it if it will work . \nI can not fathom why they have not just tried the procedure of getting tankers on the way and use the method they have mentioned to collect as much as possible . \nThat done sooner seems it would have sharply reduced the spill magnitude . \nA small-yield nuke would melt a couple hundred feet of basalt on top of that tiny hole and compress a large portion of the sea bed below that as well . \nIts just a hole in the ground . \nMelt it shut with a nuke . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "901", "time": "2010-05-30", "text": "Sun May 30 , 2010 3:39 pm EDT May 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - With the failure this weekend of BP -LRB- BP . \nL -RRB- 's `` top kill '' attempt to plug its leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well , fears are growing that the economic and environmental impact of the nearly six-week-old spill can only spread . \nHere are some facts about effects of the worst ever U.S. oil spill , triggered by the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig : THE SCALE OF THE CATASTROPHE `` This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner said on Sunday . \n`` There could be oil coming up 'til August . '' \nBrowner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' `` We are prepared for the worst . '' \nLouisiana , the nearest state to BP 's gushing undersea well that is 42 miles -LRB- 67 km -RRB- out in the Gulf of Mexico , has been the most impacted by the spill so far . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said this week that more than 100 miles -LRB- 160 km -RRB- of Louisiana 's 400-mile -LRB- 644 km -RRB- coast had so far been impacted by the spilled oil . \nState officials have reported sheets of oil soiling wetlands and seeping into marine and bird nurseries , leaving a stain of sticky crude on cane that binds the marshes together . \nBilly Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , saw dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . \n`` Oil debris '' , in the form of tar balls and surface `` sheen '' , has also been reported coming ashore since the April 20 accident in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . \nIn the week of May 17 , Coast Guard officials found tar balls on some beaches in the Florida Keys , raising fears that the so-called Loop Current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico through the Florida Straits may have already brought oil from the spill far to the southeast . \nBut laboratory tests subsequently showed the tar balls were not from the BP spill . \nThe U.S. government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama due to the oil spill . \nThis makes them eligible for federal funds to offset the impact on fisherman and their communities of the oil pollution in their fishing grounds . \nLouisiana 's $ 2.4 billion seafood industry supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. seafood supply and employs over 27,000 people . \nThe state is the second-biggest U.S. seafood harvester and the top provider of shrimp , oysters , crab and crawfish . \nNOAA on Friday extended the area closed to fishing in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the spill to 25 percent of Gulf U.S. federal waters , an area covering 60,683 square miles -LRB- 157,168 square km -RRB- , up from 20 percent previously . \nIt is taking this step as a precautionary measure to ensure that seafood from the Gulf will remain safe for consumers . \nNOAA points out that approximately 75 percent of Gulf federal waters are still available for fishing . \nBut the ban affects hundreds of thousands of commercial and recreational fishermen , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oystercatchers and charter boat operators . \nOil , some of it in thick sheets , but also in the form of sheen and tar balls , has already come ashore in Louisiana wildlife reserves like the Breton National Wildlife Refuge in the offshore Breton and Chandeleur Islands , and the Pass-a-Loutre refuge further to the south . \nOver the 40 days since the spill started , wildlife officials report that 491 birds , 227 turtles and 27 mammals , including dolphins , have been collected dead along the U.S. Gulf Coast , according to an update released on Sunday by the oil response unified command . \nOfficials stress that not all of the deaths were necessarily caused by the BP spill , and that some will have been from natural causes . \nOf the 491 dead birds collected , only 28 were visibly oiled . \nA further 66 visibly oiled birds were rescued alive . \nJournalists and scientists have also reported seeing at least one shark , and other creatures like eels and turtles , swimming through surface oil . \nWildlife officials say however they expect more marine creatures , birds and mammals will be affected . \nScientists say they are also concerned about the unseen and unknown effects on the marine environment and food chain of underwater `` plumes '' of dispersed oil , some of them several miles -LRB- km -RRB- long , emanating from the deepwater spill site . \nTourism operators in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- from hotel owners to restaurateurs and boat charterers -- have reported cancellations as a result of the oil spill , although some are picking up other business from journalists , officials and cleanup workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast . \nAmidst a scare involving tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches -- later declared not to have come from the BP oil spill , Florida 's $ 60-billion-a-year tourism industry is also losing millions as a result of the incident , a top state tourism marketing official said earlier this month . \nOf all the threatened states , Florida has the most to lose . \nTourism is its economic lifeblood , its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million Floridians . \nOfficials say even the mere threat of oil pollution from the spill is enough to make a significant `` dent '' in the tourism industries of Florida and other Gulf states . \nMississippi , Alabama and Florida are spending millions of dollars -- paid for by BP -- to get the message out that their beaches are , for the moment , free of oil . \nMajor shipping channels and ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast remain open , although some industry sources have reported possible delays caused by the oil slick . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday it had begun work to survey a new ship anchorage site at the mouth of the Mississippi River for ships to undergo inspection and oil decontamination before entering ports . \nU.S. authorities are anxious to keep Gulf shipping operating to maintain vital U.S. exports and imports . \nNOAA says the Lower Mississippi River ports export over 50 million metric tonnes of corn , soybeans and wheat each year , more than 55 percent of all U.S. grains inspected for shipment . \n-LRB- Reporting by Matthew Biggin Venice , Louisiana , Steve Gorman in Los Angeles and Pascal Fletcher in Miami , Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Sandra Maler -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nSome have mentioned that the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico may increase in size , what if a tipping point is reached and the entire Gulf of Mexico flashes into a dead zone ? \nLet me push this danger to it 's possible extremes and see what the worst case scenario may become . \nAll life in the Gulf of Mexico dies including algae and plankton . \nAlgae\\/plankton symbiotic relationship creates 80 % of all oxygen on Earth . \nCouple this with vapors rising from the chemical soup mixture that is being created from the petro chemical spill as well as the dispersant interactions with the oil and air breathing creatures -LRB- humans -RRB- could start dying in large numbers in nearby land areas . \nJust how big this spill continues to grow would effect how far toxic vapors could spread , but again let 's go worst case ; Land areas near Gulf including parts of Mexico , Texas , Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi , Florida , and Cuba may need to be evacuated . \nIn the case of Florida with prevailing winds entire state may become effected . \nRemember people are already being sickened by the fumes . \nI have no doubt now that there will be fatalities amongst those people with lung disease eventually , even in a best case scenario if the oil leak stopped today . \nEnough oil has already contaminated the Gulf waters , `` greatest environmental disaster in US history '' is how some are now reporting this event . \nBeyond environmental considerations are financial considerations . \nMany retirement funds are heavily invested in BP worldwide , and the value of BP has certainly fallen on stock exchanges , hence retirements worldwide will shortly have less returns than expected by the retired , of course all other investors worldwide will be effected as well , just that many investment funds do not inform the retired where their investments are made . \nMuch has been made of the loss of revenue by local fishermen , tourism , restaurants , and seafood distributors on down the line . \nBut this may all be just the start of financial dominoes that likely will effect everyone on Earth eventually . \nIn the hard economic times faced by the worldwide economy this could be far more than the proverbial last straw , there are too many people on Earth to supply with food than greatly reduced food sources will be able to feed . \nUnder such conditions the danger of worldwide war is a factor that can not go unconsidered , humans are not always logical creatures , and fear of starvation is motivation enough for a real worst case scenario , ie ; Human Extinction ! \nI know I am pushing this to horrible extremes , but some if not all is possible and needs consideration especially if the flow is not stopped very soon . \nThere have also been revelations that this chemical soup may soon be reaching the Gulf Stream and that may take dangerous chemicals up the entire eastern coast of North America . \nFrom there the ocean currents will carry portions of this soup to Europe and who knows how far beyond . \nWe are realizing that we have a worldwide economy , and so too the environment of the entire Earth is eventually interconnected . \nHow many people out of desperation to survive will allow toxin contaminated materials and foods to be shipped to locations worldwide ? \nDeaths are inevitable even if never tracked back to the cause . \nWhy am I pushing all these dangers to the extremes ? \nNot for fear mongering ! \nQuite the opposite actually , `` To be forewarned is to be forearmed '' Something needs to be done very soon to stop this oil flow . \nThis is an EMERGENCY ! \nExtreme action is warranted ! \nEvery nation on Earth should be concerned . \nSomething can be done ! \nThis flow can be stopped somehow , there are literally thousands of concepts out there to deal with this disaster , yet far too long a period of time is being spent between attempts . \nIf a hundred tons of concrete was dumped on the site that would likely stop the flow , but if it took a million tons of concrete it would still be needed to be done some way or another ! \nPerhaps even pumping volcano ash -LRB- which we seem to have in abundance at moment -RRB- into the well would seal it forever . \nMuch is being made of drilling the side shafts near the well to take off some of the pressure and slow the flow , but these side shafts can also be used to pump concrete or V ash into area and seal off the leak permanently . \nTo use these shafts only as a siphon to slow the flow makes it look like we are more concerned with getting the oil rather than stopping the flow from the leak . \nWe need to stop this oil flow very soon ! \nI have laid out some of the possible worst case scenarios , but I could be wrong about any of these points , however there are bound to be other worst case possibilities that I am not considering . \nEnough with this real life horror show , we gotta stop the flow ! \nIf a war broke out would we wait for a private company to fight the war because they somehow may have caused the conflict ? \nIt 's become abundantly clear what is going on with the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nHere are some steps you can take on your own to recover your property losses . \nTake pictures of everything and document everything . \nMost of your state officials can go on the Internet and find information about the Migratory Bird Treaty and the Clean Water Act . \nThe residents with property loss can Google the Bouchard B-120 oil spill in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts . \nBe sure to review the current class action litigation going on even today over the 2003 oil spill . \nThe oil spills have to stop ! \nOn April 27 , 2003 , eight years ago the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts creating a 12-foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No. 6 oil . \nRemember everyone must ask how

and bird nurseries , leaving a stain of sticky crude on cane that binds the marshes together . \nBilly Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , saw dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . \n`` Oil debris '' , in the form of tar balls and surface `` sheen '' , has also been reported coming ashore since the April 20 accident in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . \nIn the week of May 17 , Coast Guard officials found tar balls on some beaches in the Florida Keys , raising fears that the so-called Loop Current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico through the Florida Straits may have already brought oil from the spill far to the southeast . \nBut laboratory tests subsequently showed the tar balls were not from the BP spill . \nThe U.S. government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama due to the oil spill . \nThis makes them eligible for federal funds to offset the impact on fisherman and their communities of the oil pollution in their fishing grounds . \nLouisiana 's $ 2.4 billion seafood industry supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. seafood supply and employs over 27,000 people . \nThe state is the second-biggest U.S. seafood harvester and the top provider of shrimp , oysters , crab and crawfish . \nNOAA on Friday extended the area closed to fishing in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the spill to 25 percent of Gulf U.S. federal waters , an area covering 60,683 square miles -LRB- 157,168 square km -RRB- , up from 20 percent previously . \nIt is taking this step as a precautionary measure to ensure that seafood from the Gulf will remain safe for consumers . \nNOAA points out that approximately 75 percent of Gulf federal waters are still available for fishing . \nBut the ban affects hundreds of thousands of commercial and recreational fishermen , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oystercatchers and charter boat operators . \nOil , some of it in thick sheets , but also in the form of sheen and tar balls , has already come ashore in Louisiana wildlife reserves like the Breton National Wildlife Refuge in the offshore Breton and Chandeleur Islands , and the Pass-a-Loutre refuge further to the south . \nOver the 40 days since the spill started , wildlife officials report that 491 birds , 227 turtles and 27 mammals , including dolphins , have been collected dead along the U.S. Gulf Coast , according to an update released on Sunday by the oil response unified command . \nOfficials stress that not all of the deaths were necessarily caused by the BP spill , and that some will have been from natural causes . \nOf the 491 dead birds collected , only 28 were visibly oiled . \nA further 66 visibly oiled birds were rescued alive . \nJournalists and scientists have also reported seeing at least one shark , and other creatures like eels and turtles , swimming through surface oil . \nWildlife officials say however they expect more marine creatures , birds and mammals will be affected . \nScientists say they are also concerned about the unseen and unknown effects on the marine environment and food chain of underwater `` plumes '' of dispersed oil , some of them several miles -LRB- km -RRB- long , emanating from the deepwater spill site . \nTourism operators in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- from hotel owners to restaurateurs and boat charterers -- have reported cancellations as a result of the oil spill , although some are picking up other business from journalists , officials and cleanup workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast . \nAmidst a scare involving tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches -- later declared not to have come from the BP oil spill , Florida 's $ 60-billion-a-year tourism industry is also losing millions as a result of the incident , a top state tourism marketing official said earlier this month . \nOf all the threatened states , Florida has the most to lose . \nTourism is its economic lifeblood , its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million Floridians . \nOfficials say even the mere threat of oil pollution from the spill is enough to make a significant `` dent '' in the tourism industries of Florida and other Gulf states . \nMississippi , Alabama and Florida are spending millions of dollars -- paid for by BP -- to get the message out that their beaches are , for the moment , free of oil . \nMajor shipping channels and ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast remain open , although some industry sources have reported possible delays caused by the oil slick . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on Friday it had begun work to survey a new ship anchorage site at the mouth of the Mississippi River for ships to undergo inspection and oil decontamination before entering ports . \nU.S. authorities are anxious to keep Gulf shipping operating to maintain vital U.S. exports and imports . \nNOAA says the Lower Mississippi River ports export over 50 million metric metric tones of corn , soybeans and wheat each year , more than 55 percent of all U.S. grains inspected for shipment . \n-LRB- Reporting by Matthew Biggin Venice , Louisiana , Steve Gorman in Los Angeles and Pascal Fletcher

{"id": "1355", "time": "2010-06-17", "text": "WASHINGTON | Thu Jun 17 , 2010 5:18 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Republican U.S. representative apologized to BP CEO Tony Hayward on Thursday , saying BP was victim of a White House `` shakedown '' by having to set up a $ 20 billion Gulf oil spill fund , a comment that angered both Democrats and Republicans . \nJoe Barton of Texas , a major recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , received such ridicule for his unusual apology to the oil giant that he later retracted his statement . \nAt the start of a congressional hearing featuring testimony from Hayward , Barton said it was `` a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . '' \n`` I 'm speaking totally for myself , I 'm not speaking for the Republican Party ... but I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday , '' Barton told Hayward . \nHours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as `` outrageous '' and the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them . \n`` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' with regard to yesterday 's actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning , and I retract my apology to BP , '' Barton said . \nHe added : `` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . '' \nBarton 's statement had put his own Republicans on the defensive and gave hope to Democrats searching for any way to fend off expected losses to Republicans in November 2 congressional elections . \nAt the White House , President Barack Obama shook his head in response and said , `` I do n't know why anyone would say that , '' said spokesman Robert Gibbs . \nObama on Wednesday pressured BP to set up the compensation fund for the Gulf spill during a meeting at the White House . \n`` I find it incredibly insensitive , incredibly out of touch , '' Biden told reporters . \n`` There 's no shakedown . \nIt 's insisting on responsible conduct and a responsible response to something they caused . '' \nBarton 's position was politically perilous because Americans largely blame BP for the devastating spill and want the huge company to pay for it . \nHis stance was bound to be unpopular in the Gulf region , where the spill is wreaking havoc on the economy -- fishermen are out of work and hotel and restaurants are struggling in an area heavily dependent on tourism . \nRepublican House leaders John Boehner , Eric Cantor and Mike Pence disassociated themselves from Barton . \n`` Congressman Barton 's statements this morning were wrong . \nBP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion dollars for that purpose , '' they said . \nEven Hayward disagreed with Barton 's description of the escrow account as a `` slush fund . '' \n`` I certainly do n't think it was a slush fund , '' he told the hearing . \nThe White House 's Gibbs said Republicans should ask themselves whether Barton should be their party 's leading representative on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce . \nThere was some talk of Barton losing his position . \nBut Barton was not alone among Republicans who question the $ 20 billion fund . \nGeorgia Representative Tom Price , chairman of the Republican Study Committee , a group of conservative House members , issued a statement arguing the same point . \nPrice said BP 's willingness to go along with the White House 's new fund suggests that the Obama administration is `` hard at work exerting its brand of Chicago-style shakedown politics . '' \nAnd former Texas Republican Representative Dick Armey , who was House majority leader and is a leading voice in the conservative Tea Party movement , told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast this week that Obama lacks the constitutional authority to set up such a fund . \nIn addition , conservative Republican Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota told the Heritage Foundation think tank that the escrow account was a `` redistribution-of-wealth fund . '' \nBarton is the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions in the House of Representatives , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics . \nIts data showed that Barton has collected $ 1,447,880 from political action committees and individuals connected with the oil and gas industry since 1989 . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nChicago style politics is at it again . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nObama , who has been criticized by some for not being tough enough on BP , demanded in Wednesday 's White House meeting that the company set aside money in an independently administered fund to pay for claims arising from the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nAn April 20 explosion on an offshore rig owned by the British energy giant killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep-sea well . \nThe ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles -LRB- 190 km -RRB- of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . \nIn a conciliatory statement outside the White House , BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg apologized to the American people on behalf of BP . \n`` I do thank you for the patience that you have during this difficult time , '' he said . \n`` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies who do n't care , but that is not the case in BP , we care about the small people , '' Svanberg said . \nSvanberg said BP 's board had agreed not to pay dividends this year and promised to make sure damage claims were handled swiftly and fairly . \nBP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to fund a planned $ 20 billion fund to pay for the oil spill . \nThe commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had expected . \nInvestors had expected the suspension of BP 's dividend , or payment in shares for a couple of quarters and had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb BP 's future growth . \nThe White House said it did not believe that BP would have agreed to set up the special fund without pressure . \nObama had called for such a third-party administered fund after hearing first-hand complaints from Gulf coast residents that BP 's claims process was too long and complicated and that the company was paying out too little money . \nHe stressed , however , that it did not put a cap on BP 's liabilities for the disaster . \nObama said BP had also agreed to set aside $ 100 million for workers who had lost jobs because of a six-month moratorium his administration imposed on deepwater drilling after the spill . \n`` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable . \nAnd I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people , '' Obama said . \n`` BP is a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so , '' Obama said . \nThe oil giant represents a large part of investments in Britain . \nObama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill at the weekend . \nBP 's shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent in the morning before swinging back to punch into positive territory after news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account . \n`` It takes a little bit of pressure off BP , '' Iain Armstrong , an oil analyst at brokerage Brewin Dolphin in London , said of the escrow agreement . \n`` If it gets Obama off their back , it ca n't be that bad . '' \nThe $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP 's average annual profits over the past four years . \nFeinberg was the `` pay czar , '' the official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds . \nFeinberg also oversaw a compensation fund for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States . \nUnderscoring concerns in Britain that Obama is trying to increase BP 's potential liabilities for the spill , Cameron said BP was eager to face claims arising from the spill but it should not have to pay any that are too far removed from the disaster . \nCameron is under intense domestic pressure to stand up for BP , which many Britons perceive is being treated too harshly by the U.S. administration to the detriment of British pension funds and other investors with big stakes in BP . \n`` While it 's important that they -LRB- BP -RRB- pay reasonable claims , and BP accept this themselves , they do need a level of certainty , and this is BP 's worry , that there wo n't be claims entertained that are three or four times removed from the oil spill , '' Cameron said during a BBC radio phone-in program . \nAs BP 's executives met with Obama administration officials at the White House , the company continued to wrestle with the oil spill in the Gulf . \nIt started up a second system to siphon oil from its gushing leak early on Wednesday , a day after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from its well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day . \nThe new containment cap system is intended to increase overall collection capacity to 28,000 barrels a day from around 15,000 a day now . \nThe company is drilling relief wells that it hopes will definitively halt the spill in August . \n"}

'' \nSeveral lawmakers grew visibly annoyed by Hayward 's answers , accusing him of evasion and telling him they were less interested in his expressions of regret and more concerned about finding out what had gone wrong . \nThe Briton said he had seen no evidence of reckless behavior and repeatedly said he was not involved in the decision-making about the methods used to dig the well . \n`` I am not stonewalling , '' Hayward said at one point . \nHayward 's careful replies may have been a reflection of the fact that company still faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits that could lead to it paying out billions of dollars . \nInvestors welcomed the deal BP reached with the White House on Wednesday setting up a $ 20-billion fund for compensation claims arising from the spill . \nIt gave them a clearer picture for the first time of the potential costs facing BP . \nBut equity analysts and credit ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded BP on Thursday , citing growing liabilities and the White House deal as a competitive disadvantage . \nBP might try to sell $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in bonds next week -- not because it needs the money but to boost investors ' confidence by showing it can pull off a big deal even amid the political storm , CNBC reported . \nBP declined to comment on the report . \nHayward 's opening statement to the hearing , in which he said he was `` deeply sorry '' for the spill , was interrupted by a protester with her hands painted black and who yelled , `` You need to be charged with a crime , Tony . \nYou need to go to jail . '' \nShe was hustled out of the chamber by police . \nHayward told lawmakers BP was doing everything possible to contain the spill . \nIt was triggered by an explosion on an offshore rig on April 20 that killed 11 workers and ruptured its well , unleashing a torrent of crude into the Gulf . \nThe Obama administration 's point man for the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , told reporters BP was ahead of schedule in drilling a relief well to permanently cap the blown-out well . \nBut he said he could not guarantee it would be finished before its scheduled completion date in August . \nThe spill has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , threatened multibillion dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , dolphins and other sea life . \nLawmakers have said BP ignored warnings from contractors and their own employees and chose faster and cheaper drilling options that increased the danger of the well rupturing . \nExecutives from other major oil companies distanced themselves from BP at an earlier congressional hearing this week , saying BP had failed to adhere to industry standards in the construction of its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nUnder harsh questioning from lawmakers on Thursday , Hayward urged them to await the outcome of an investigation into the spill and defended his three years as CEO . \nHe said he had made dramatic safety improvements but conceded more could be done . \nAs he spoke , a live video feed on BP 's website showed black crude continuing to gush into the Gulf from under a containment cap that has been placed on top of the leak to try to siphon off the oil and channel to a ship on the surface above . \nEnvironmentalists worried that the political theater playing out on Capitol Hill was taking the focus off the disaster confronting Gulf Coast communities . \n`` This oil is already into the wetlands and more is coming up every day . \nYou can not clean it out of there . \nThe impact of the spill are going to be felt for decades , '' John Hocevar , a marine biologist with Greenpeace , told Reuters in Louisiana . \nDuring Thursday 's hearing , Republican congressman Joe Barton of Texas , the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , stunned fellow lawmakers when he apologized to Hayward for the $ 20 billion escrow account the White House pressured the company to agree to . \n`` I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion , that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . '' \nHours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as `` outrageous '' and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them . \nIn London , the company 's stock closed up nearly 7 percent , catching up with gains notched in the U.S.-listed shares on Wednesday after BP 's deal with the Obama administration gave investors enough clarity on liabilities to offset disappointment about a suspended dividend . \nThe stock lost some of those gains in New York trading , dropping about 1 percent as lawmakers questioned Hayward . \n`` Investors need to think of it as a speculative investment at this point , '' Brian Youngberg , energy analyst at investment firm Edward Jones said of BP 's shares . \n`` You 're getting no income , and you 're hoping things go better . '' \nFinancial analysts BofA Merrill Lynch and Seymour Pierce downgraded BP from their top ratings following the announcement about the escrow account . \nWhile Hayward was testifying in Washington , BP continued to siphon off oil from its ruptured well in the Gulf . \nBP is boosting its oil-containment effort after activating a new oil-burning system on Wednesday . \nSiphoning capacity will hit 28,000 barrels per day `` early next week , '' versus the 18,600 barrels that BP trapped on Wednesday , Allen said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis will not fix everything BP has screwed up or the devastation this has caused and will continue to cause for years to come . \nThey should have been fined a billion dollars a day from day 1 !!!!!

Exxon did the same thing after its oil disaster over two decades ago but was criticized for it . \nThe final costs to Exxon shareholders from the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster were less than the headline cleanup figures , as many costs were deductible . \nBut Boeing Co decided to forego seeking a tax deduction for any of a $ 615 million settlement with the government in 2006 over ethics charges , under pressure from lawmakers . \n`` The company 's goal is going to be write off as much as possible , '' Edward McNally , a lawyer at Kasowitz , Benson , and a former U.S. prosecutor who headed the criminal division in Alaska during the Exxon Valdez litigation . \n`` On the other hand , we live in a representative democracy and people are very adverse to the idea that a large corporation gets ` special tax breaks ' as a result of paying us what they owe us for their own missteps , '' McNally added . \nBP was not available for comment on whether it would take a tax deduction for the fund . \nUnder the plan , a new independent claims process will be set up to pay for damages to people and businesses . \nBP has agreed to contribute $ 20 billion over a four-year period at a rate of $ 5 billion per year , including $ 5 billion this year . \nBP will provide assurance for these commitments by setting aside $ 20 billion in U.S. assets . \nAsked whether the tax issue came up during the negotiations for the escrow fund , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters it did not , and he was unsure whether it would be part of the discussion as they work out the final terms of the fund . \nFrank O'Donnell , president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch , said there would likely be a swift negative reaction from the public and lawmakers if the escrow fund proves to be a tax writeoff . \n`` I think that the American public would be justifiably outraged to realize it is subsidizing this horror show , '' O'Donnell said . \nHe also said lawmakers are under pressure to craft a legislative response to the oil spill , and the tax deductibility issue would be a leading issue on the agenda . \nWHICH SIDE OF THE FENCE ? \nTo be sure , BP will likely not be able to deduct everything , including penalties and any fines for crimes . \n`` Expenses that are penalties , that are designed to punish , to deter future wrongdoing , those most likely ... would not be tax deductible , '' said Anthony Sabino , a law professor at St. John 's University . \n`` It 's a matter of taking an item and saying which side of the fence does it fall upon . '' \nCompanies can , however , deduct punitive damages awarded in lawsuits from their taxes , an ability some U.S. lawmakers have been trying to change . \nEarlier this week , Senate Majority leader Harry Reid introduced a proposal to disallow such deductions in a pending tax bill . \nThe timing of any tax deductions will depend on how the fund is structured , tax experts say . \nIf BP keeps the funds on its books , but earmarked for the fund , no deduction can be taken until money is paid out , according to Johnson . \nIf the fund is independent and there is no way of BP getting a refund for funds paid into it , they would be deductible . \nFor David Heikkinen , an analyst with Tudor , Pickering , Holt , the question is whether or not the deductions will hold . \n`` Those expenses can be categorized as tax-deductible , '' he said . \n`` The question is , will the government allow them to be deducted ? \n`` Under today 's tax law , those are deductible costs . \nEverything seems like it can change , '' Heikkinen said . \n"}

Coast Guard\\/Petty Officer 3rd Class Patrick Kelley\\/Handout ROBERT , Louisiana | Sat May 8 , 2010 5:29 pm EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc suffered a setback on Saturday in an attempt to contain oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico with a metal box when crystallized gas filled the structure , a blow to hopes of a quick , temporary solution to a growing disaster . \nBP engineers have moved the four-story containment dome -- which was seen as the best short-term way to stem the flow from a ruptured oil well -- off to the side on the sea floor and will take two days trying to come up with a solution , Doug Suttles , chief operating officer , told reporters . \nThe problem is with gas hydrates , essentially slushy methane gas that would block the oil from being siphoned out the top of the box . \nAs BP tries to solve it , oil keeps flowing unchecked into the Gulf in what could be the worst U.S. oil spill . \n`` I would n't say it 's failed yet . \nWhat I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work because these hydrates plugged up the top of the dome , '' Suttles said . \n`` What we 're currently doing , and I suspect it will probably take the next 48 hours or so , is saying , ` Is there a way to overcome this problem ? ' '' \nThe company , under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage to the Gulf and coastlines of four states , expected hydrates , but not the volumes encountered after a crew lowered the dome nearly a mile to the sea floor . \nPossible solutions may involve heating the area or adding methanol to break up the hydrates , Suttles said . \nOfficials had already warned there was no guarantee that the technology would work at such water depth . \nBP had spent the previous day or so lowering the 98-ton contraption to the well site with the aid of sensors , video cameras and undersea robots . \nIt hopes to attach a pipe to the chamber to start pumping oil up to a tanker , with the aim of capturing about 85 percent of the leaking oil . \nThe spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster targeting beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nIt has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . \nBP suffered another blow on Friday when ratings agency Standard & Poor 's lowered its outlook on the British oil giant to negative from stable . \nIt has said it will pay all legitimate costs , a bill that is likely to run into the billions of dollars . \nThe company gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for two weeks . \nSuttles said BP may now try to plug up the existing preventer or attach a new one on top of it . \nIt also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take up to three months to complete . \nIn the initial blast , a natural gas cloud enveloped the rig and exploded just as visiting BP officials were celebrating seven accident-free years in the rig 's crew quarters , according to accounts by survivors of the blast . \nAccording to transcripts of interviews obtained by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , a giant methane bubble rushed up the drill pipe and filled the air above the deck of the drilling platform with flammable gas , followed by a scalding flood of crude that spilled onto the drill deck and ignited . \nNine workers on the drill deck were killed , along with two others working in the nearby mud storage room , Bea said . \nAfter several days of calm weather , winds began to pick up on Saturday , preventing controlled burns of the thickest concentrations of oil . \nCrews conducted five burns on Friday . \nNearly 200 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on Saturday . \nCrews have laid almost 900,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . \nIn Bayou La Batre , the heart of Alabama 's seafood industry , the docks were largely quiet as thousands of shrimpers and seafood processors remained idled by fishing restrictions prompted by the oil spill . \nAbout 30 oyster-processing plants have run out of product and shut down , putting as many as 900 people out of work , said Wayne Eldridge , owner of J&W Marine Enterprises and an oyster plant operator himself . \n`` I 'm screwed , '' Eldridge said . \n`` The biggest thing is I 've got 35 people unemployed there . '' \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said a $ 75 million legal cap on the companies ' liabilities for economic damages under federal law , which some U.S. lawmakers now want to raise , would not be a limit and renewed promises to meet all `` legitimate '' claims . \nStandard & Poor 's , in announcing BP 's negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely . \nMoody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project . \nS&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill-fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is `` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean-up . '' \nOther companies involved are Transocean , owner of the rig ; Cameron International , which supplied the failed blow-out preventer for the well ; and Halliburton , which helped cement in place the blown-out well . \nAn estimated 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf each day since the well ruptured . \nBut Ian MacDonald , a biological oceanographer at Florida State University , said the estimate was much too conservative . \nThe real flow rate from the undersea well , based on aerial images of the oil slick and estimates of the thickness of the oil itself , is probably closer to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/4 million liters -RRB- per day , MacDonald told Reuters . \nA sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land . \nSome oiled birds have been found in recent days . \nBP contractors and commercial fishermen worked feverishly in waist-deep water to anchor booms around tiny uninhabited barrier islands as thousands of birds watched , according to a Reuters photographer . \nThe Breton refuge was closed to the public after a silver sheen and emulsified oil reached the shoreline , the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said . \nAltogether , crude from the spill could hit 24 national wildlife refuges . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nObama was too busy playing stand up comic to even bother with this situation for nearly TWO WEEKS ! \nThen , instead of sending the world 's best engineers to save our shorelines , he sent LAWYERS to see who could be SUED . \nHow much money will bring back the coral reefs , the white beaches , the sea ? \nObama is utterly useless . \nTo the last poster : Where do you get your `` facts '' ? \nThe administration declared it an emergency within a couple days and had already directed coast guard officials and the DOD to act expeditiously in containing the leak . \nThe answer to your question is Billions , with a a B , it will cost BILLIONS to fix the problem . \nThis is exactly why we should n't be risking our waters and beaches with offshore oil drilling , instead we should be creating thousands of jobs by implementing off shore wind farm . \nLet us all hope and pray that they are successful in placing this dome and that it works . \nDo everything we can to help the effort to stop this leak ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "2179", "time": "2010-05-08", "text": "MOBILE , Alabama | Sat May 8 , 2010 1:07 am EDT MOBILE , Alabama -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The lowly oyster , a tasty delicacy to seafood lovers but a curiosity to more squeamish diners , is also the backbone of marine life along the U.S. Gulf Coast and among the most vulnerable creatures now threatened by a giant oil spill . \nThe region 's oyster beds are the vital foundation of a commercial and recreational fishing industry -- including shrimp , crabs and other shellfish -- that generates $ 6.5 billion in annual revenues , according to one recent estimate . \nThe networks of reefs built up in shallow waters by these unassuming bivalves are like the Gulf of Mexico equivalent of the Caribbean 's coral reef system , only with oysters at the base of the pyramid instead of live coral . \nIn addition to providing shelter and food for a complex web of undersea species , the way coral reefs do , oyster beds serve a number of other important functions by virtue of their proximity to land . \n`` It is not only the economic engine of this region , it is a real indicator of the environmental and ecological health of the Gulf Coast area , '' said Jamie Rappaport Clark , executive vice president of the conservation group Defenders of Wildlife and former head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . \nOyster beds form undersea breakwaters that buffer shorelines and wetlands from erosion due to storm surge , helping preserve a habitat for birds and land animals . \nAt low tide , exposed oyster banks themselves offer a feeding ground for some birds . \nAnd as filter feeders , oysters constantly strain the water of impurities for the estuaries , bays and marshlands that lie behind them , a characteristic that also makes the oyster reef particularly sensitive to contamination . \nGulf fishery managers are bracing for the arrival of oil gushing from a ruptured undersea wellhead off Louisiana 's coast since April 20 , when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig under contract with BP Plc exploded . \nThe blast killed 11 crew members , sank the rig and unleashed a spill that could eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . \nThe spill comes at a particularly bad time for oysters , coinciding with the peak season for oyster `` spat , '' the release of billions of tiny juvenile oysters the size of pepper flakes into the water , where they drift until those that survive settle onto a reef , attach themselves and grow to adulthood . \nThe Gulf 's oyster beds are `` getting ready , like all other fisheries , to suffer a significant assault in the coming weeks , '' Clark said . \n`` And these filter feeders are the first lines of impact . '' \nA MARINE ECOSYSTEM MOST UNDER THREAT Various seabirds , like the brown pelican , which was taken off the endangered list last year , and five species of endangered sea turtles , all just starting to nest in the area , also are at high risk and are more visible to the public . \nBut oysters are likely to be the region 's great unsung victims , whose destiny near the bottom of the food chain will be registered throughout the Gulf Coast marine environment . \nAlthough decades of water pollution , much of it runoff from farms , storm sewers and industry , has taken a toll on aquatic life along the U.S. Gulf Coast , the region still is home to the world 's last , largely intact network of oyster reefs . \nCompared with other types of marine ecosystems , oyster reefs on the whole are considered by scientists to be the most environmentally damaged globally , declining by 85 percent over the past several decades . \nThe Chesapeake Bay along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard , for example , has lost 99 percent of its once-bountiful oyster beds , said Mike Beck , a senior marine scientist for the environmental group Nature Conservancy . \nWith over half of its reefs still left , the Gulf Coast is the world 's `` last , best '' chance of maintaining a healthy oystery , Beck said . \nThe Gulf Coast leads U.S. commercial oyster production , accounting for nearly 70 percent of a total national catch valued at $ 131.6 million in 2008 , the last year for which government figures are available . \nWith the oil slick taking longer than first expected to reach the main coastal areas , fish and wildlife agencies have scurried to cordon off the most ecologically sensitive areas with containment booms they hope will minimize the damage . \nIn Alabama , the spill poses a serious setback to efforts to enhance oysteries and other marine resources . \nThe state recently launched an ambitious restoration program that includes temporary closure of its publicly owned oyster reefs and the relocation of 6 million pounds of oysters from upper Mobile Bay to other areas , said Chris Denson , a marine biologist at the state Conservation Department . \nSeparately , the Nature Conservancy secured nearly $ 3 million in federal economic stimulus money to fund a pilot program to test three kinds of artificial reef structures along a salt marsh island near Mobile Bay . \nThe project was more than half complete when it was put on hold due to the oil spill . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe let our government run a muck and allow multi national corporations to bypass safeguards , just to save money . \nWe can blame it on BP , but who elected the politicians that allowed the safeguards to be overlooked ? \nThe BP spill is yet another symptom of our self-destructive personalities . \nThe post I see here are nothing less than vile . \nThe problem that people do not understand is that one kind of fuel as the Earth surges in population is not a simple wind , sunlight or sugar cane propistion as we see with the killing of the Rain Forrest to grow sugar Cane The so called green energy plans including oil must be integrated together . \nWhat is going to come down to is energy managemnet . \nPeople tend to shoot off thier moouths without all the facts at hand and forget that we are animals -LRB- Mamals -RRB- too . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "1609", "time": "2010-06-10", "text": "HOUSTON | Thu Jun 10 , 2010 7:51 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. government scientists on Thursday doubled their estimate of the amount of oil gushing out of a ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well as British energy giant BP scrambled to stem the leak . \nThe news that the flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day came after U.S. markets closed . \nBP shares closed 6.65 percent down in London at 365.50 pence while in New York they rebounded from 14-year lows to end 12.3 percent higher at $ 32.78 . \nOn Thursday the White House said that President Barack Obama and senior administration officials would meet BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg next Wednesday . \nBP has come under increased pressure from the Obama administration in recent days and on Thursday British Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain stood ready to help the British company deal with the spill . \nSpeaking during a visit to Afghanistan , Cameron said he would take up the matter Obama when they speak in the next few days . \nNeighboring Mexico also entered the fray on Thursday . \nIt expects oil from BP Plc 's damaged Gulf of Mexico well to reach its shores by December , and is considering how to sue the company for any environmental damage , Mexico 's environment minister told Reuters . \nEnvironment Minister Juan Elvira said Mexico is trying to stock up on oil booms and netting , a tough task because the United States has used up most of the gear available to protect its coastline , to try to capture oil that will start drifting south when sea currents change in October . \nThe spill , already the worst in U.S. history , may well be much bigger than many had thought . \nU.S. scientists said on Thursday that between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 and 1.7 million gallons\\/3 .2 million and 6.4 million liters -RRB- of oil flowed from the well before June 3 , when BP 's remotely operated robots sawed through an underwater pipe to clear the way for a capping procedure . \nThe cutting of the pipe likely increased the flow , but BP says it has collected 73,324 barrels -LRB- 3.1 million gallons\\/11 ,7 million liters -RRB- of oil since installing the capping system . \nThe well 's average flow rate was 25,000-30 ,000 bpd , according to the findings of the so-called Flow Rate Technical Group announced by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt . \nBP had no input into the team 's findings . \nThe wide variation in the estimates points to the difficulty in estimating flow of a well that is 1 mile beneath the surface and reachable only by remotely operated robots . \nBP said it was capturing more of the torrent of oil that has spewed relentlessly from the sea bottom since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and set the disaster in motion . \nBut the almost 16,000 barrels it said on Thursday it had collected in the previous 24 hours is triple its initial estimates of the leak 's flow rate , a point that will not be lost on critics as U.S. public and political anger mount . \nIn another sign the spill is spreading , heavier concentrations of oil began washing up on Florida seashores late on Wednesday . \nUntil then , debris from the spill had been limited in the state to relatively small tar balls . \nIt is taking a mounting toll on sea birds and other wildlife and has devastated the commercial and recreational fishing industries in southern Louisiana . \nThe Obama administration has kept up the heat , saying it would make sure BP paid all damages and cleanup costs from the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of coastline . \nThe crisis is now on the global diplomatic agenda for allies Britain and America . \nCameron 's comments in Kabul marked the first time he had spoken publicly about the catastrophe . \nCameron , who took office in May and is under pressure domestically to stand up for the British company , is due to talk to Obama by telephone this weekend . \nObama has been sharply critical of BP . \nThe two leaders ' conversation will have to seek a delicate balance between domestic pressures and long-standing U.S.-British ties . \nThey will also take place against a backdrop of extreme market volatility for BP . \nBP was the second-most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday after taking a 16-percent dive to a 14-year-low the previous day amid concerns over BP 's ability to meet mounting costs . \n`` The stock is obviously volatile as investors try to wager on the outcome of the Gulf oil spill , '' said Jud Pyle , chief investment strategist at Options News Network , a division of option market maker PEAK6 Investments in Chicago . \nAnalysts said the company 's improved performance was partly due to speculation that PetroChina , Asia 's top oil and gas firm , was considering making a bid for BP . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nSounds like they 're a team to me . \nAnd guess who the opponents are ? \nThis is not a political problem , the fix and cleanup will go on for years . \nObama is only a President with limited powers , there is the judical branch of government that deals with the final damage assesment . \nRemember , America is a democracy , there is no King or Queen like in the UK . \nMy best guess is that BP will have to sell the company to pay for all the final damages . \nThe buyer most likely will be Chevron , or Royal Dutch Shell . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe

{"id": "465", "time": "2010-06-10", "text": "WILMINGTON , Delaware | Thu Jun 10 , 2010 4:42 pm EDT WILMINGTON , Delaware -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The chances of BP declaring bankruptcy to deal with oil-spill claims are remote for now , bankruptcy professionals said , although that option would be open to the company if liabilities became overwhelming -- and that very much depends on when the oil stops gushing . \nBP 's shares plunged this week and investors scooped up insurance to protect against the possibility the company will default on its debt . \nFor now , though , experts who sort out bankrupt companies say there is little likelihood that financially strong BP will need to seek protection from creditors . \n`` At this moment , the likelihood of BP filing for bankruptcy is probably remote because it has access to billions of dollars in credit , solid cash flow and a healthy balance sheet , '' said Brad Sandler , a bankruptcy attorney with Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones in Wilmington , Delaware . \nJon Pack , a BP spokesman in Houston , said the company had not been in discussion with anyone regarding bankruptcy . \nThe big question : How long will it be before BP finally caps the well that is spewing crude into the Gulf of Mexico , befouling shorelines and threatening fishing grounds ? \nStephen Lubben , a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark , New Jersey said he did n't think BP would seek bankruptcy unless `` we 're still talking about this in 2011 and the price tag has reached $ 75 billion or $ 100 billion . '' \nBP has said it has the financial flexibility to deal with liabilities related to the spill , which to date have cost it about $ 1.4 billion . \nThe financials tell the story of a trim company in peak condition . \nIts assets exceed its liabilities , a measure of solvency or shareholders ' equity , by more than $ 100 billion . \nIt has had at least $ 24 billion in net operating cash flow for each of the last five years , according to financial filings . \nBP is no Lehman Brothers , which vanished into Chapter 11 virtually overnight in a market panic . \nLehman 's reported liabilities exceeded its shareholder equity by 23 times . \nIf Lehman Brothers was a tower of assets on a razor-thin foundation of equity , BP is virtually the opposite -- a squat structure of stability . \n`` In the pure economic world of bankruptcy , do they have enough money to pay their debts ? \nI do n't think any of us know that for a fact , '' said Robert Stark , a bankruptcy attorney with Brown Rudnick in New York . \n`` At least in the short term they have the capability to pay . '' \nThe costliest U.S. oil spill was the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident , which cost about $ 4 billion for clean-up , fines and damages , although it spilled less than a third the oil leaked by the Deepwater Horizon accident . \nHurricane Katrina , the worst disaster in U.S. history , ran up insured losses of about $ 41 billion . \nThe bankruptcy talk was stoked on Wednesday by a report in Fortune magazine , which quoted Matt Simmons of boutique investment bank Simmons & Co , who said BP had a month before it would file for bankruptcy . \nBP shares traded in New York tumbled 16 percent . \nOn Thursday , Simmons ' office said he would not be able to return calls until June 15 and that there were `` three pages of names '' of reporters who called for an interview . \nLegal liabilities related to asbestos have been forcing U.S. companies into bankruptcy for nearly 20 years , and their experience could be a blueprint for BP . \nTypically , a liability-dogged company files for Chapter 11 protection from creditors , establishes a process to value claims and sets up a trust to pay those claims . \nThe bankruptcy immediately consolidates all legal action in one court , before one judge , eliminating the uncertainty of jury trials in varying jurisdictions . \nA bankrupt BP would look a lot like the current BP -- it would continue to be a major supplier of energy to the world and a major employer . \nAs attractive as that might be , it is not something BP could or would do now , according to bankruptcy professionals . \nDavid Skeel , a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Philadelphia said BP would be hard pressed to find a bankruptcy court that would accept a Chapter 11 petition . \n`` They are so obviously solvent , '' he said . \nJust last month , the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware punished a subsidiary of Transocean Ltd , which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig , for trying to use Chapter 11 to limit its liability from an unrelated spill in Louisiana . \nSkeel said a bankruptcy might make sense in the next two years , once the spill is capped . \n`` One benefit to filing is to bite the bullet , swallow it and move on . \nThey will have this continuing water torture of litigation , '' he said . \nAnother option might be a trust established outside of bankruptcy , which would shield the company from the uncertainties of Chapter 11 , but this would probably need the involvement of the U.S. government . \nThe best thing for Washington is to have a BP continuing to generate cash and earnings to pay claims . \n`` If BP declared bankruptcy it will be viewed poorly by investors and credit markets , '' said Robert Hartwig , the president of the Insurance Information Institute in New York . \nOne sign of trouble : BP is already being forced to pay more for short-term debt and commercial paper , a form of borrowing that companies use to manage cash flow . \nThe yield on its debt coming due next year has risen above its bonds due in 2019 , a red flag that could signal fraying market nerves . \n`` A company that is ` solvent ' on a balance sheet basis can end up in Chapter 11 if creditors panic and the company develops cash flow problems , '' said Lubben , the Seton Hall law professor . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nA little inside information for anybody still fool enough to be holding onto their BP shares . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "469", "time": "2010-11-17", "text": "WILMINGTON , Delaware | Wed Nov 17 , 2010 12:08 pm EST WILMINGTON , Delaware -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Claimants to BP Plc 's $ 20 billion oil spill fund may soon be required to transfer to the company their right to sue other defendants , a move that could help BP 's efforts to collect billions of dollars from its business partners . \nThe proposal is part of a final set of rules being circulated by fund administrator Kenneth Feinberg , who is overseeing the release of cash to shrimpers , hotel owners , restaurateurs and others on the Gulf Coast seeking compensation . \nThe proposed rule , outlined in a draft document obtained by Reuters , would still offer victims the opportunity for full payment for documented damages . \nLawyers who have seen the document said it could be a powerful tool for BP as it seeks contributions to the compensation fund from other corporate defendants , including Halliburton Co and Transocean Ltd. `` I think the most significant thing about this is it reconceptualizes the fund as not just BP 's share but BP trying to settle all the claims with whoever accepts it and then being able to go after the others for a contribution , '' said Bob Percival , a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore . \nLanguage in the draft proposal requires that claimants transfer , or subrogate , their legal rights to BP . \nClaimants would sign over their right to sue those responsible for the spill in the same way a car owner might when accepting an insurance payment after being hit by a negligent driver . \nJust as the auto insurer could use that right to try to recover money from the negligent driver , BP will be able to pursue its partners for a portion of the claims it paid , according to legal experts who have seen the draft document . \nThat could be worth billions of dollars if BP is successful . \n`` They are trying to shift the loss to other companies , '' said Michael Steenson , a law professor at William Mitchell College in St Paul , Minnesota . \n`` They are trying to get out of it at least some of what they put in . '' \nThe proposal could be implemented as soon as next week , when the fund is scheduled to shift from paying partial emergency payments with no strings attached to final payments , which require claimants to drop lawsuits and legal claims . \nIn an emailed statement on Wednesday , Feinberg 's office emphasized the language of the proposal is not final . \nThe statement also said the fund will continue to make partial payments with no strings attached beyond next week . \n`` Options are available to claimants , '' the statement said . \nFeinberg circulated the proposed rules to lawmakers and attorneys for comment , but he has made clear the decision to implement the rules will be his , not BP 's . \n`` It is ultimately my call as the administrator , '' he told Reuters in an interview last week . \nReuters obtained the draft document from two people involved in the claims process . \nBP declined to comment beyond saying it supports the efforts of the fund and those of Feinberg , who the company has called a neutral or independent administrator . \nHalliburton , which cemented BP 's well , and Transocean , which owned the rig , did not return calls seeking comment . \nAlthough legal specialists said there are few comparisons to the Gulf claims fund , similar transfers of rights were required for those who accepted payments from a fund set up to compensate for the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . \nFeinberg also oversaw that fund . \nThe April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig set off the largest oil spill in U.S. history . \nUnder pressure from the Obama administration , BP set up the claims fund in June . \nIt was meant to demonstrate that the company would pay for the damage caused by the spill . \nMore than 300,000 businesses and individuals have filed claims so far , and the fund has paid about $ 2 billion , Feinberg said . \nLast Friday , Halliburton moved to defend itself against BP . \nIn court papers , the company said it did not intend to waive a $ 75 million legal cap on its liability from the spill and said that cap would apply toward efforts by others to get a contribution toward their settlements . \nBP has waived the cap and has encouraged its partners to do the same . \nThe cap does not apply in cases of gross negligence or when federal safety regulations have been violated . \nThe amount that each party could be at fault is unlikely to be resolved soon , and could be settled in a trial set for early 2012 . \nA White House oil spill commission last week issued a report largely agreeing with BP 's investigation that put much of the blame on the partners in the drilling operation . \nFeinberg will release his final rules at a time when he is under increasing criticism along the Gulf Coast for what some have called slow and inconsistent payment of claims . \nIf fewer people sign up for final payments and instead pursue claims in court , that could add to BP 's legal problems . \nPlaintiffs could end up spending years in court and have no guarantee of winning , but if successful they could reap large punitive damage awards . \nAlabama Governor Bob Riley said last week that Feinberg was using `` extortion '' by underpaying emergency claims as a way to force businesses into the final settlement process . \nFeinberg told Reuters he has paid 85 percent of the claims for emergency payments in full . \nHe also said he plans to continue a partial payment system , with no strings attached , so no one would be forced to a final settlement . \n`` I reject the criticism out of hand that the Gulf Coast Claims Facility is reducing payments for the vast number of claimants . \nIt 's just not true , '' said Feinberg . \nThe Press-Register newspaper in Mobile , Alabama has called for Feinberg to resign , saying he had tossed businesses in need `` just enough crumbs to barely keep them alive .

You would have thought that a White House so concerned about its image would have been all over this , '' he said . \nThe book , published on Monday , contains conversations that cast Obama in an unflattering light . \nJindal said Obama was furious with him the first time he flew to Louisiana after the spill began because of a letter requesting food stamps for workers impacted by the disaster . \nObama quietly scolded him while then chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , cursed Jindal 's chief of staff . \nA second meeting went no better because Obama was upset about televised criticism . \n`` He was concerned about looking bad because of the letter . '' \n` Careful , ' he said to me , ` this is going to get bad for everyone , ' '' Jindal said , describing the scene as `` almost surreal '' . \nThe White House was `` making decisions about an industry -LRB- oil -RRB- they knew little about , '' says the book , which also blasts the government for deficit spending and health care reform . \n`` The federal government 's response to the oil spill was lackadaisical almost from the start , '' Jindal said , repeating criticism he made frequently during the spill itself . \nThe book also takes aim at members of Congress whom Jindal compares to `` little kids '' who `` place their own political interests ahead of their constituents .

{"id": "40", "time": "2010-11-19", "text": "BP says it wo n't fight cap waiver on spill damages NEW YORK | Fri Nov 19 , 2010 6:26 pm EST NEW YORK Nov 19 -LRB- Reuters Legal -RRB- - BP Plc wo n't object to a court order legally binding the company to waive a $ 75 million statutory cap on damages for the largest oil spill in U.S. history , the company said on Friday . \nEarlier on Friday , the company was prepared to oppose a plaintiffs ' motion before U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier , who is overseeing the oil-spill litigation in New Orleans , seeking a ruling that the liability cap is inapplicable in this case . \nNoting that BP itself had told the court it would waive the cap , the plaintiffs ' lawyers asked Barbier to rule on the matter to preclude BP from `` re-urging this defense '' in the future . \nIn a response filed on Wednesday , BP called the plaintiffs ' motion `` unnecessary '' and `` premature . '' \nBut on Friday , the company said in a statement to Reuters Legal that if Barbier issues a court order making the cap waiver legally binding , `` BP will not object . '' \nOn November 2 , BP raised its estimated cost of cleaning up the Macondo disaster by $ 7.7 billion to $ 40 billion . \nBP will likely try to recoup some of these costs from its Macondo partners , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC , as well as such contractors as Halliburton but the resolution could take years of court battles . \nBP has already paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to fishermen , retailers , charter boat captains and property owners who suffered from the spill . \nUnder heavy pressure from the Obama administration , in June the company also established a $ 20 billion compensation fund for those damaged by the spill . \nSoon after BP 's Deepwater Horizon well began spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico in April , the company said that it would pay all legitimate claims , even though the Oil Pollution Act -LRB- OPA -RRB- could have limited BP 's liability for the disaster to $ 75 million , plus clean-up costs . \nBut it was never clear whether BP 's pledge was legally binding , and signals from the company were mixed . \nDuring a court hearing last month , BP 's lawyers did not commit to waiving the OPA cap , which they called `` not relevant . '' \nAfter Barbier asked the company to clarify , it filed a statement with the court saying it was committed to waiving the cap . \nThe BP statement said that the company 's opposition to the plaintiffs ' motion `` was not an indication that BP was wavering at all on its previous promises and commitments , '' but rather , was `` simply based on the legal deficiencies '' in the motion . \nHoward M. Erichson , a professor at Fordham University School of Law and an expert in mass torts , said plaintiffs ' lawyers were engaging in `` a bit of litigation gamesmanship . '' \nFrom the company 's perspective , he said , `` there is no upside having the waiver locked in , '' but opposing such a move could present a publicity problem . \n`` The extraordinary thing , '' he said , `` is the backdrop to this motion -- the fact that BP faced such an enormous public-relations crisis that it was willing to abandon some of its potential legal defenses early in the litigation . '' \nThe case is In re Oil Spill , U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Louisiana , No. 10-MDL-2179 . \nThe plaintiffs ' motion was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs ' steering committee by Stephen J.

{"id": "38", "time": "2010-12-01", "text": "LONDON | Wed Dec 1 , 2010 8:28 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Last month , BP increased by $ 8 billion the financial provisions it was taking for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ; the company 's shares rose . \nBetter-than - expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new Chief Executive Bob Dudley were taken by the market as a sign the company had turned the corner and would soon return to pumping out steadily rising dividends . \nKey to this sanguine outlook is confidence that the new estimate of the total cost of the spill -- $ 40 billion -- will be sufficient . \n`` We think that $ 40 billion adequately provisions for the liabilities that are outstanding so far , '' said Mark Lacey , Fund Manager at Investec Global Energy Fund . \nPaul Mumford , fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management , went further , saying the provision is likely to be overly conservative : `` You might well find that you get provision write-backs , '' he said , hinting the bill could be lower . \nThat optimistic view may turn out to be true . \nBP executives have said this is their `` best estimate '' of costs , adding they could turn out lower . \nBut history shows there is ample scope for nasty surprises from BP . \nThe London-based oil giant -- last year it was the biggest non-state controlled oil and gas producer in the world -- has so far consistently underestimated the scope and potential cost of the Gulf spill . \nIt also has a track record of low-balling disasters , including the fatal Texas City refinery blast in 2005 . \nNot only has the company underestimated the cost of repairing equipment and ecosystems in the past , it has also made overly optimistic assumptions about legal challenges . \nThat may be happening again . \nCEO Dudley , an American who took over from Briton Tony Hayward in October , has said a $ 20 billion fund BP created to compensate victims of the spill should cover all damages claims . \nThe lawyers who are suing BP do n't think so . \n`` The total value of the claims already registered could exceed the amount of money that has been dedicated to pay the fund , '' said Texas-based trial lawyer Brent Coon , who represents victims of the explosion and subsequent spill and who was prominent in litigation against BP after Texas City . \n`` Then you have the claims that have not been filed yet , and claims from those indirectly impacted , and shareholder derivative claims ... You have very large potential claims that could , in total , be exponentially greater than the amount set aside . '' \nZygmunt Plater , Professor of Law at Boston College Law School , agrees . \n`` In the short term , it 's in everyone 's interests within the company to low-ball -- but the portents are there for a realistic inflation of $ 20 - $ 50 billon , '' he said . \nAn analysis by Reuters of the potential fines , damages , costs related directly to the leak , compensation and the damage to BP 's business suggests the final spill bill could , over the long term , end up much higher than BP 's latest provision -- perhaps even more than twice as much . \nMuch hinges on whether U.S. courts find the company was `` grossly negligent '' in the run-up to the disaster , but there are other risks . \nBP declined to comment for this article , beyond stating that it stands by its statements on the likely costs and that its estimates are based on the assumption that it was not grossly negligent . \n`` UNPRECEDENTED STRING OF BAD NEWS '' BP 's inability to gauge the true scope of the spill in the early days in April is well documented . \nAfter the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , following an explosion which killed 11 workers , the company initially hoped to staunch the flow of oil from the well by activating shut-off valves with subsea robots . \nIn case this did n't work , it started drilling a relief well to permanently plug the well from below . \nA week after the blast , the company said the well would take three months to complete and cost $ 100 million -- but that would be the most expensive part of the whole response operation . \nCombining this with the daily expenditure that BP reported at the time suggested a total bill of $ 200 million . \nBP hinted then that even this calculation was pessimistic . \nAs estimates of the spill flow increased -- it eventually became the worst in U.S. history -- so did the cost . \nFrom an initial 1,000 barrels per day to 5,000 bpd , it finally reached 62,000 bpd . \nIn June , BP told analysts the cost of containing and cleaning up the spill would be $ 3-6 billion . \nBy mid-September , the response effort alone , excluding damages claims , had cost BP $ 8 billion . \nInvestment analysts were forgiving of these errors . \nThe disaster seemed to grow worse and worse making accurate estimates difficult . \n`` It was an unprecedented string of bad news , '' Simon Hawkins , oil analyst at Ambrian said last month . \nBut even after the well was capped , BP appeared no more adept at forecasting costs . \nTwelve days after it had sealed the top of the well , on July 27 , the company said the likely cost of the spill would be $ 32 billion . \nOn November 2 , it hiked its estimate by another 25 percent , or $ 8 billion . \nBP 's Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote blamed that increase mainly on a delay in completing the relief well , which meant the company needed to keep its offshore response effort going longer . \nIn a conference call with analysts , he also cited costs related to decontamination of the thousands of ships used in the spill response and undefined administration and legal costs . \nBP did not give a detailed breakdown , but it is hard to see how the delay in the relief well accounted for most of the increased provision . \nAssuming an extra 40 days at the average cash-burn for the operation of $ 60 million per day gives an extra spend of only $ 2.6 billion . \nIn addition to this , the well delay and many extra costs were already clear in July and could have been factored in earlier . \nNonetheless , analysts have largely accepted the company 's estimates . \nPerhaps this is on the assumption that after months of bad publicity , the suspension of dividend payments for at least three quarters , a collapse in its share price to less than half its pre-spill level and a change of CEO , BP would take the opportunity to throw every conceivable cost into the mix and pave the way for recovery under a new boss . \nIt 's a common enough practice when corporations change CEO . \n`` I tend to believe BP . \nGiven how bad it was , they basically decided to kitchen-sink it , '' says Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon . \nWHAT HISTORY CAN TEACH US Such an assumption , though , may not be entirely safe in BP 's case . \nThe company 's record of assessing costs after past disasters is less than stellar . \nBP 's Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico captured front pages around the world in the summer of 2005 when a hurricane left it listing precariously . \nThe company predicted it would take a year and $ 250 million to repair the damaged platform . \nIn the end , it took almost three years to fix ; analysts estimate BP spent more than $ 500 million . \nThat undershoot was nothing compared with what followed the explosion at its Texas City refinery in 2005 . \nThe blast killed 15 workers and ruined the company 's carefully nurtured reputation as the green and caring face of Big Oil . \nBecause it was a single-point disaster , the cost of Texas City should have been easier to quantify than an ongoing catastrophe like the Gulf spill . \nA gasoline production unit destroyed in the blast would need to be replaced , BP said . \nThe going cost for such machinery was widely agreed to be in the region of $ 100 - $ 200 million . \nA few pessimists added in ancillary damages , lost profits and legal costs to arrive at a total cost of $ 1 billion . \nBut a month after the accident , then-CEO John Browne said the final bill would be `` significantly '' less than that and analysts put the total cost at around $ 300-400 million , a figure the company appeared comfortable with . \nBy 2008 , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least . \nClaims remain outstanding , so the final tally could be even higher . \nIs BP making the same mistake on penalties and compensation again ? \nA `` gross negligence '' finding would require the Department of Justice to show a high degree of recklessness on the part of senior BP officials , rather than a mistake by a low-level worker . \nBP has blamed low-level employees and its contractors for the Deepwater Horizon rig blast . \nOn November 8 , a report by the White House oil spill commission prompted many analysts to assume it was going to be tough to pin gross negligence on BP for the Gulf spill , and BP shares rose as a result . \nThe commission said it had found no direct evidence of `` a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety '' in BP . \nBut the commission 's co-chairmen , Bill Reilly and Bob Graham , subsequently stressed that its November 8 finding did not mean anyone was off the hook . \nThey said a `` culture that did not promote safety '' had fostered misjudgments leading up to the disaster in all the companies involved . \nA panel of scientists conducting another probe for the government subsequently said that BP 's systems for managing drilling risks were inadequate . \nSome lawmakers argue that in BP 's case , the culture created an incentive for employees to short-cut safety precautions without issuing explicitly dangerous orders . \nDavid Logan , professor of law at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island , believes there is no legal reason why a claimant could not establish gross negligence on the part of a corporation based solely on its culture . \n`` Can you stitch together an argument of gross negligence from the corporate culture ? \nIt is possible to do that , '' Logan says . \nIf BP is found to be grossly negligent , the U.S. Clean Water Act allows for a fine of up to $ 4,300 per barrel , nearly four times the $ 1,100 maximum BP otherwise faces . \nThe government estimates 4.9 million barrels of oil flowed from BP 's well , suggesting a maximum fine of $ 5.4 billion if `` gross negligence '' is not proven , and $ 21.1 billion if it is . \nThe company has argued that it should receive credit for the 700,000 barrels of oil which it scooped from the surface or burned , and it disputes the government estimate of the size of the spill . \n`` I think there 's room for considerable discussion there , '' Dudley said last month . \nA close study of company statements suggests BP has factored in a fine below $ 4 billion . \nAs well as adding billions to that , a gross negligence finding would prevent BP from forcing its partners to pay their share of any fine or cleanup costs . \nAnadarko Petroleum , 25 percent owner of the blown-out well , and 10 percent owner , Japan 's Mitsui , have so far refused to pay , saying their contractual obligation to do so is void due to gross negligence on the part of the project operator , BP . \nAny costs BP might recover are not included in its current estimates because accounting rules prevent this , although the company has said it does expect to recoup money from its partners and has reserved the right to sue the companies it hired to help drill the well . \nMost lawyers expect BP and the Department of Justice to reach a settlement that avoids a court ruling on the degree of negligence . \nThe spill -- and President Barack Obama 's inability to halt it -- hurt the president 's ratings . \n`` The government can not let them get away with it . \nAfter President Obama came in with the heavy foot , they just ca n't , '' the chief executive of a rival oil company , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the spill , told Reuters . \nPlater , the Boston professor , says if the government sought to be aggressive it could attempt to broaden the interpretation of environmental and economic damages that BP must make good . \nOil and fishing dominate employment along the Gulf coast , especially in Louisiana , the state worst hit by the spill . \nWhile most of the fishing bans have been lifted , experts say it will take years for the coast to recover . \n`` There are different ways of measuring natural resource damages and the ecosystem services argument , '' Plater says . \nWhen you knock out an ecosystem , looking at the damage in terms of indirect harm to the economy could carry the cost `` into the hundreds of billions '' . \nBP 's assessments of the environmental damage caused by the spill are at the optimistic end of the spectrum . \nA government report released in August suggested up to 75 percent of the oil had disappeared -- BP has often referred to this report , and former CEO Hayward recently told a gathering of students in Cambridge , England , that all of the spilled oil had gone . \nHowever , researchers at the University of Georgia said in late August that about three-quarters of the oil was still lurking below the surface ; other studies have also pointed to the prospect of severe long-term damage . \nBP will be on the hook to make any such damage good . \nWhatever BP ends up paying in fines and cleanup costs , there could be another big charge : punitive damages . \nSuch a charge would be helped by a finding of gross negligence , though claimants could pursue punitive damages even if gross negligence was n't proven . \nExxon Mobil paid punitive damages of $ 1 per $ 1 of economic damage following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska when the captain of the tanker , who had been drinking , hit a reef . \nJamison Colburn , Professor of Law at Penn State University , says it is not entirely clear whether the current law covering oil spills at sea will allow punitive damages for BP , though if such damages are allowed , a one-to-one ratio would be in line with precedents like the Valdez . \n`` Punitive damages are a wild card , '' he said . \n`` It 's still an open question . '' \nIn the Texas City case , BP settled all claims out of court , so a judge did not rule on punitive damages . \nHowever , lawyers say the amount paid out in settlements is consistent with an expectation there was a good chance significant punitive damages would have been awarded . \nIf BP were to face punitive damages , given the prevailing estimates of economic damages at around $ 20 billion for the Gulf spill , a fine at the same ratio could add another $ 20 billion to its bill . \nBut trial lawyer Coon says he believes punitive damages could be levied at a higher multiple , because the accusations against BP are greater than those Exxon faced . \n`` In that accident , a drunk captain inadvertently ran his ship onto a reef . \nThe drunk captain was n't doing something at the request of the company , '' Coon said , referring to the arguments which would underpin a gross negligence claim . \nWhat 's clearly not included in BP 's spill estimate is a figure related to the damage the disaster has done to its U.S. business over the long term . \nBP said it lost 30,000 barrels per day of production in the Gulf -- one of its most profitable bases -- in the third quarter , and expected further impacts in the fourth quarter and into 2011 . \nBut the added regulatory scrutiny the oil firm is likely to undergo in the United States will surely add to its operating costs . \nAnalysts at Bernstein say BP 's upstream production costs could rise by 10 percent , or $ 280 million a year . \nUsing the company 's own internal discount rate of 9-13 percent implies the present value of a 10 percent rise in these costs would be $ 2.5 billion . \nIf other areas of BP 's U.S. business faced similar increases , the hit could be twice this . \nIn addition , some lawmakers have called for BP , currently the Gulf 's largest operator , to be banned from future license rounds . \n`` BP may find that when its application for a license goes in , it is put in the ` pending ' file while Shell or someone else gets the license , '' said Iain Armstrong , analyst at Brewin Dolphin . \nTally up fines commensurate with gross negligence , punitive damages at a ratio of just once economic damages , lower production , a 10 percent rise in U.S. operating costs , and difficulties in securing new reserves in the United States , and you quickly reach a figure around $ 50 billion . \nThat may not be as dramatic as it sounds : some costs could still be shared with partners and contractors , many would be tax deductible , and they would in any case probably be payable over many years . \nThe company can likely afford even the most pessimistic estimates . \nBut things might not be as easy today as they were in 2005 . \nBP 's under-clubbing of the costs of Texas City was made up for by a more than doubling of the oil price between 2005 and 2008 . \nThe outlook for crude now is less bullish , which may mean the oil giant has fewer places to hide . \n`` A very slight miscalculation now about what we think is going to happen is magnified by the huge numbers of stake holders -LRB- who could make claims -RRB- , '' said Logan of Roger Williams University . \n`` A billion here , a billion there and pretty soon you 're talking about real money . '' \nDespite BP 's official statements , some industry analysts say the company may be expecting to have to pay more . \n`` The way that they are selling assets and strengthening their balance , is what you would expect them to do if they were preparing for a worse scenario such as a finding of gross negligence , '' said one analyst who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen questioning BP 's public comments . \nCurrently , analysts predict BP will reinstate its dividend in early 2011 , at half the pre-spill level . \nIf it has n't done its sums right , a return to steady dividend growth from the company could take quite a while longer . \n-LRB- Editing by Sara Ledwith and Simon Robinson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nU.S. officials and the media offered no help or sympathy , only demonized the company and the situation . \nIf a family member had such a problem , the least one would do is say , `` What can I do to help ?

{"id": "547", "time": "2010-09-15", "text": "LONDON | Wed Sep 15 , 2010 2:53 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward defended the oil giant 's safety culture under a grilling from British members of parliament as UK regulators released dozens of documents questioning the company 's record . \nCost cuts were not behind the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , and the accident highlighted industry failings rather than flaws particular to BP , Hayward told a UK parliamentary committee on Wednesday `` It 's been easy for some parties to suggest that this is a problem with BP . \nI emphatically do not believe that that is the case , '' Hayward told the Energy and Climate Change Committee . \nHayward denied that there was any underlying link between the Deepwater Horizon rig blast in April , which led to the United States ' worst ever oil spill , and previous safety lapses at BP such as a 2005 refinery blast that killed 15 workers . \n`` It 's very dangerous to join up dots that may not be appropriate to join up , '' he said . \nHayward said rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil criticized the way BP designed and drilled the well because they were motivated to do so by the political climate in the United States at the time . \nExxon denied this and said it believed that BP 's choice of well design , the type of cement used -- which BP acknowledged contributed to the rig blast -- and BP 's failure to conduct a common safety check , were key mistakes . \n`` This was a deviation from standard industry practice , '' a spokesman said . \nBP capped its blown out well on July 15 and is preparing to seal it permanently . \nAnalysts said they had expected BP to take a tougher legal and public stance against opponents after the well was killed . \nBritain 's safety regulator released documents on Wednesday that showed it found , just three months before the Gulf of Mexico rig blast , that BP lacked a clear chain of command for dealing with a loss of well control on a North Sea oil rig . \nHealth and Safety Executive -LRB- HSE -RRB- inspectors visiting the Magnus platform 160km northeast of the Shetland Islands in late January discovered there was confusion about who would order a well shut-off in the event of a blow-out . \n`` Baker Atlas personnel stated that in the event of a well control incident requiring the well to be closed in , that BP would make this decision , '' the HSE said , referring to a unit of oil services provider Baker Hughes . \n`` The BP well services supervisor expected that Baker Atlas would make this decision , '' the HSE added in the letter to BP . \nThe Deepwater Horizon blast followed a loss of well control and survivors told investigators that there was confusion on board the rig about who was in charge following the incident . \nThe HSE added in one letter that on a BP 's Clair platform there was `` evidence of a culture among your contractors , Seawell -LRB- up to senior levels of management -RRB- , of working outside of procedures , permit or permit conditions . '' \nBP , whose safety culture has been criticized heavily by U.S. politicians , responded by saying : `` The letter from the HSE last year relates to comments made by a contractor which the safety representatives on the platform strongly felt did not reflect the reality of the platform 's safety culture and practices . '' \n`` Following further engagement with the HSE the matter was closed , '' BP added . \nStavanger-based Seawell 's chairman , Joergen Rasmussen , said he was surprised by the HSE comments . \nBP also failed to provide adequate safety training to North Sea staff and to conduct adequate oil spill response exercises , the Department of Energy and Climate Change said in separate documents , although the department said the matters had since been addressed . \nHayward got less confrontational treatment from the committee than he received from a U.S. congressional committee , which interrogated him for several hours . \nThe committee chairman , Conservative party MP Tim Yeo , quizzed Hayward about whether he had been pressured by the White House into cutting BP 's dividend and whether the U.S. government and media had treated him fairly . \nPresident Barack Obama 's popularity in the UK has been hit by what many Britons consider as Washington 's anti-British attacks on BP . \nHayward refused to offer a view on whether the criticism he received was fair and denied it was pressure from the White House which forced BP to cut its dividend . \nHayward steps down in two weeks to be replaced by Bob Dudley , who is running the oil spill response . \nHayward said his own poor image in the U.S. made his position untenable . \nBP plans to drill in the deep water west of the Shetland islands in 2011 , BP 's North Sea boss , Bernard Looney , said . \nHe said the rig which will likely drill the prospect would have a blow out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- with two shear rams , rather than just one , as the BOP on the Deepwater Horizon rig had . \nThe failure of the BOP to operate and to slice through the drill pipe of the blown-out well is one of a series of failures that BP said caused the disaster . \nBP 's shares closed down 2.7 percent at 404 pence , lagging a 1.0 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tom Bergin and Dan Fineren ; Editing by Louise Heavens and Robert MacMillan -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nLong before Walt Disney Co made its mark in Florida , tourists came to the `` Sunshine State '' for its beaches . \nThe tourism industry pumps more than $ 60 billion a year into the state economy . \nGulf Coast communities are even more dependent upon the seasonal industry , which in northern Florida peaks in the summer months . \nEconomist Sean Snaith , who directs the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida in Orlando , said a conservative estimate has the state losing at least $ 2.2 billion in revenue and 39,000 jobs . \nThat 's assuming a 10 percent decline in employment and output in tourism-related business in the 23 counties on the Florida Gulf Coast . \nIf the impact becomes more severe or prolonged , dropping employment and output in half , Snaith said the state could lose nearly $ 11 billion in business activity and more than 195,00 jobs . \nThat would be a body blow to a state just recovering from a housing market crash and suffering high unemployment . \nHe acknowledges that exact numbers are difficult to nail down . \n`` A hurricane passes through and it 's a limited duration event . \nThere 's damage and you can figure it out , '' Snaith said . \n`` Here , we do n't know when -LRB- the oil -RRB- is going to arrive or how long it 's going to stay . \nTo use a hurricane analogy , we do n't know what category it 's going to be . '' \nHis calculations did not take into account predictions that ocean currents could carry the oil around to Florida 's Atlantic Coast as well as the Gulf . \nState tourism officials have been trying to spread the word that most Florida beaches remain untainted by the spill . \nIt 's a moving target . \nIn Perdido Key , off Florida 's Panhandle , local health officials on Tuesday posted notices on the beaches telling visitors not to swim . \nIt was the first such advisory posted for Florida beaches because of the oil spill . \nBy Wednesday morning , however , tar balls were few and far between and no oil sheen was present . \nFlorida marketing officials are tailoring their messages to would-be tourists and offering live beach updates on the state 's website , www.visitflorida.com . \nLocal economic development officials are doing the same , but it 's hard to compete with around-the-clock media coverage of a story with global interest . \n`` There is a whole lot of anxiety and a lot of concern , '' said Chris Thompson , president and CEO of VisitFlorida , the state 's tourist marketing arm . \n`` Our battle is to separate the misperceptions from reality . '' \nBill Stromquist , treasurer of the Perdido Key Area Chamber of Commerce in northwest Florida , said local booster efforts were being hurt by tourism officials in other states . \nDuring a recent road trip down the U.S. eastern seaboard , Stromquist said he stopped at state-run visitor information stations in each state along the way . \nIn each place , he was told incorrectly that Florida beaches were closed . \n`` They 're killing us and I do n't know how to fix it , '' Stromquist told state tourism representatives on Wednesday . \n`` People are canceling before they get the information that the beaches are clean .

{"id": "1328", "time": "2010-06-09", "text": "WASHINGTON | Wed Jun 9 , 2010 7:18 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - British energy giant BP Plc 's stock price plunged to a 14-year low in U.S. trading on Wednesday amid concerns over its ability to meet mounting costs of the giant Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nPresident Barack Obama 's administration , getting tough as polls show public disapproval over its handling of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , threatened to impose new penalties on the company . \nBP depositary shares trading in New York fell nearly 16 percent to close at $ 29.20 , their lowest level since August 1996 , on growing worries about the costs the company will have to assume . \nBP said last week it has `` plenty of '' cash to deal with the problem and the Obama administration has made similar comments . \nA BP spokesman said `` nothing has changed '' since Friday and restructuring experts agreed that by running the numbers alone , BP looked able to handle the financial damage . \nBut such confidence was not evident in the market . \n`` It seems that shares are under pressure from the fear of whether BP can survive . \nIt is not just a rumor about the potential of a dividend cut in BP anymore . \nNow it 's about the survivability of the company , '' said Jon Najarian , a founder of Web information site optionMonster.com in Chicago . \nU.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate hearing he would ask the British oil major to repay the salaries of any workers laid off because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater exploratory drilling imposed by the U.S. government after the spill . \nTurning up the heat on the beleaguered company , a senior U.S. Justice Department official said after the markets closed that the department was `` planning to take action '' to ensure BP had enough money on hand to cover damages from the spill . \nBP 's total bill so far , including cleanup costs , has reached $ 1.25 billion and the U.S. government has already said it will have to pay billions more in penalties . \nThe White House echoed Salazar 's comments . \n`` The moratorium is as a result of the accident that BP caused . \nIt is an economic loss for those workers , and ... those are claims that BP should pay , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a briefing . \nBP believes it may be heading for a showdown with the White House over widening liability demands , a BP source said . \nWhile the company has said it will pay for the clean-up and direct damages to those affected by the spill , the moratorium was a government decision and costs related to it were a different matter , the source said . \nEarlier , the company 's stock closed down 4 percent in London on concerns the company might have to suspend its dividend payment . \nU.S. politicians have been calling for this , saying the company should put its cash into paying for legal claims and environmental damage in the Gulf . \nAt a congressional hearing on Wednesday , one lawmaker asked U.S. Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli whether the Justice Department had the ability to issue an injunction against BP to stop it paying its dividend . \n`` We are looking very closely at this and we are planning to take action , '' he said . \nWith Wednesday 's share price drop in New York , BP has given up more than half its market value since the crisis began . \n`` The confidence in BP being able to stop the oil leak and deal with the ecological aftermath has disappeared , '' said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe Kinahan . \nIllustrating analysts ' anxiety about BP 's dividend , in the past two days alone , seven have cut their expectations on the likely payout . \nThe cost of protecting BP 's debt against default hit new highs on Wednesday . \nThe spill began on April 20 after an oil rig exploded , killing 11 workers and rupturing the deep-sea well . \nIt has caused environmental devastation along the U.S. Gulf Coast and threatens lucrative fishing and tourist industries . \nThe Obama administration , facing growing voter discontent over its own handling of the crisis , has sought to distance itself from the company . \nObama has also toughened his rhetoric in recent days and said in an interview this week he would fire BP CEO Tony Hayward if he worked for him . \nIn a further sign of the administration 's pressure on BP , Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who is leading the government relief effort , demanded that the company provide more information and transparency on how it was meeting damages claims by individuals and businesses affected by the spill . \n`` The federal government and the public expects BP 's claims process to fully address the needs of impacted individuals and businesses , '' Allen said in a June 8 letter to BP . \nBP has paid out close to $ 50 million in damages claims so far along the Gulf Coast -- mostly to fishermen , shrimpers , oystermen and boat operators who say their livelihoods have been impacted by the spill . \nSTILL NO HANDLE ON THE FLOW RATE Allen told reporters that BP planned to move another rig to the spill site on June 14 . \nThis would enable the company to boost its capacity to collect oil from the well to 28,000 barrels -LRB- 1.18 million gallons\\/4 .45 million liters -RRB- a day , he said . \nAllen did not indicate this meant the flow rate of the oil could be as high as 28,000 barrels a day , but his comments are likely to underscore that neither BP nor the government have yet managed to determine just how much oil is gushing out . \nGovernment scientists have estimated that the leak spews 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day , with one estimate as high as 25,000 barrels . \nThey are due to present revised estimates later this week or early next week . \nThe spill has already fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama . \nIt has also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters remains closed to fishing and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \nBP 's latest containment effort , which follows a series of earlier failed attempts , involved placing a containment cap with a seal on a deep-sea pipe from which the oil is gushing . \nBut the ultimate solution to the leak lies in the drilling of a relief well and that wo n't be completed before August . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nCNN today on Anderson 360 showed HD video of the sawed off well before it had the containment cap . \nThe HD showed that the saw off was really irregular and jagged . \nIt showed huge amounts of gushing oil and gas , much clearer than ever before . \nJust as a lay person , I can see that this amount of gushing oil has to fill up a barrel in 2-3 seconds at least . \nMathematically , if it is just 3 seconds per barrel , that amounts then in 24 hours 28,800 barrels . \nIf it just one second , then 86,400 barrels . \nTwo seconds , 43,200 barrels per day . \nFive seconds would be 17,280 . \nBut what if it is just 1\\/2 second for one barrel , then it would be 172,800 barrels . \nNow , an experiment could have been done to gush water at the requisite pressure known to exist with this well . \nThey had pressure readings before the blow out to know that number . \nSo , with an experiment , they can find out how much water is ejected out of a pipe at this pressure , and convert to the density of oil , to come up with the time factor on gushing oil per second , or seconds . \nThis is not really rocket science , but basically 10th grade math . \nMy big question , is why is the govt hiding this from the people I can understand the criminals at BP hiding and obscuring this critical information . \nBut why is Obama and everybody in the govt hiding the truth from us ? \nI already see the writing on the wall . \nThis is going to be the emergency Rham and Obama use to push energy legislation to force our country away from carbon related energy and to punish us with the carbon credit purchase scheme

'' \nBP officials have said that oil from the well rises to the surface because it is lighter than water . \n`` There are n't any plumes , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said on May 30 . \nBut after analyzing underwater samples gathered by researchers aboard the University of South Florida 's research vessel , the Weatherbird II , a different conclusion emerged . \n`` The bottom line is yes , there is oil in the water column , '' Lubchenco said . \n`` NOAA is confirming the presence of very low concentrations of subsurface oil at sampling depths ranging from the surface to 3,300 feet -LRB- 1,006 metres -RRB- at locations 40 -LRB- 74 km -RRB- and 42 nautical miles -LRB- 78 km -RRB- northeast of the well site and another sampling station at 142 nautical miles -LRB- 263 km -RRB- southeast of the wellhead , '' Lubchenco said . \nThe oil is `` in very low concentrations '' around 0.5 parts per million , '' and other NOAA research ships are in the Gulf to gather additional samples , she said . \nUndersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels , jellyfish and shrimp . \nOne researcher who recently studied the undersea oil aboard the NOAA research ship Thomas Jefferson said the oil detected south of the spill site appeared to be in small concentrations . \n`` These are not like rivers of oil flowing down deep , '' said Daniel Torres , a scientist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts . \n`` We 're detecting pretty low levels . '' \nNOAA has been trying to `` fingerprint '' the oil to confirm that it came from the BP well . \nSurface samples taken 40 miles northeast of the well were `` consistent with the BP oil spill , '' but hydrocarbons from samples taken 42 miles and 162 miles from the well `` were in concentrations too low to do the actual fingerprinting , '' Lubchenco said . \nThe U.S. government and BP have concentrated their efforts on corralling the oil that floats to the surface and washes ashore in what is the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nBut the government has little experience in dealing with subsea oil , said Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort . \n`` We have not generally done subsurface responses , '' Allen told the news conference . \n`` In my own personal experience I have not dealt with it . '' \nBP has sprayed about 1 million gallons -LRB- 3.8 million litres -RRB- of chemical dispersant on oil at the ocean surface and wellhead , which causes the oil to either dissipate or sink to the ocean floor . \nScientists involved in the studies will testify on Wednesday before a House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee panel that is probing the spill . \nAmong those testifying will be Samantha Joye , a University of Georgia marine sciences professor who last month reported finding a plume roughly 20 miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- long , six miles -LRB- 10 km -RRB- wide , and 100 feet -LRB- 30 metres -RRB- thick . \nIt could take years to assess the impact of the spill on underwater life , Joye said . \n`` When you interfere with the natural processes in a system , when you alter the carbon cycle and the oxygen cycle , it 's very likely that impacts will cascade up the food web to the top predators , '' she said . \n"}

{"id": "129", "time": "2010-05-16", "text": "The accident at the offshore oil rig is threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nAs BP pushed forward with its tricky undersea effort to redirect the flow of oil after another setback , two members of President Barack Obama 's Cabinet demanded that BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward explain in detail the company 's commitment to pay for damage caused by the enormous spill . \n`` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a letter to Hayward . \n`` Therefore , in the event that our understanding is inaccurate , we request immediate public clarification of BP 's true intentions , '' they added . \nWith crude oil gushing unabated into the sea from its blown-out offshore well a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- deep on the floor of the Gulf , BP sought to guide undersea robots to insert a small tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface . \nBP 's initial attempt to insert the tube into the riser ran into trouble when the metal frame that supports the siphon shifted , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told reporters in Robert , Louisiana on Saturday . \nSuttles said BP hopes to get the siphoning tube inserted late on Saturday night and operational overnight . \n`` We did have to pull it back to surface -LRB- Friday -RRB- to make some adjustments so that we could connect it properly to the pipework , '' Suttles said . \n`` We expect to begin operation of that equipment overnight tonight . '' \nThe company 's previous attempt to contain the oil using a giant containment dome failed last week . \nThe spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . \nIt threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster ever . \nFisheries and tourism , two of the Gulf Coast 's economic mainstays , along with birds , sea turtles and other wildlife , are threatened by the spreading slick . \nIn an interview published in a British newspaper on Friday , Hayward appeared to play down the disaster . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . \nThe amount of volume of oil and dispersant that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total volume of water , '' Hayward was quoted as saying in Britain 's Guardian newspaper . \nHayward also acknowledged his job was on the line and that he would be judged by the company 's response to the disaster . \nBP 's shares have tumbled and wiped out $ 30 billion of market value since the disaster began last month . \nQuestions have been raised about current U.S. law that limits to $ 75 million energy companies ' liability for lost business and local tax revenues from oil spills . \nWriting to Hayward , Salazar and Napolitano cited statements by BP executives that the company was taking responsibility for the spill and would cover spill-related costs . \n`` Based on these statements , we understand that BP will not in any way seek to rely on the potential $ 75 million statutory cap to refuse to provide compensation to any individuals or others harmed by the oil spill , even if more than $ 75 million is required to provide full compensation to all claimants , '' Salazar and Napolitano wrote . \nEarlier , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said oil washed up in Mississippi for the first time in the state on Saturday , when tar balls were discovered at Long Beach . \nOil has now contaminated several beaches in three states after it was also located at sites in Louisiana and Alabama . \nOfficials said that so far the spill has had minimal impact on the shoreline and wildlife but a massive operation is underway to protect areas seen as vulnerable along the coast . \nSeeking to curb the volume of oil reaching the surface , the U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency have authorized more undersea use of chemical dispersants at the source of the leak . \nDispersants are designed to break the oil into small droplets more likely to sink to the sea floor . \nSuttles , speaking to reporters after flying over the scene of the spill , said the use of the chemical dispersants appears to be working . \n`` The oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations , '' Suttles said . \nSome environmental groups and the Gulf 's shrimping industry have raised concerns about the effect of the chemicals , saying the oil might not sink all the way , but become suspended in the water column and ingested by fish and other wildlife . \nCleanup crews continue attacking the oil slick using surface dispersants , skimming and controlled burns . \nInland , BP contractors assisted by flotillas of hired shrimp boats continued to string containment booms around sensitive coastal areas . \nNational Guard teams with bulldozers and helicopters pressed on to plug gaps in booms protecting Louisiana 's storm-battered shoreline to prevent oil from reaching the fragile marshlands behind them . \nThe vast but dwindling marshes are the nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make Louisiana the leading producer of commercial seafood in the continental United States and a top destination for recreational anglers . \nObama on Friday gave a tongue-lashing to all the companies involved in the spill -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd -- and said he would not rest until the leak was stopped at its source . \nEstimates of the rate of escaping oil range widely from the official BP figure of 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 litres -RRB- , adopted by the government , to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million litres -RRB- per day . \n"}
{"id": "1820", "time": "2010-05-16", "text": "HOUSTON\\/GALLIANO , Louisiana | Sun May 16 , 2010 7:59 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/GALLIANO , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP marked a limited success at containing the oil that is gushing unabated into the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday and said it may be able to stop the flow permanently in about a week . \nBut reports of huge oil plumes in the Gulf -- including one as large as 10 miles long , three miles wide and 300 feet thick -- underscored the spill 's environmental impact as the crisis moved into its 24th day . \nCrude oil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured well about a mile under the ocean 's surface , threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nAfter other attempts to contain the spill failed , BP Plc succeeded in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas . \nThe underwater operation used guided robots to insert a small tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface . \n`` It 's working as planned and we are very slowly increasing the rate that is coming from the riser tool up to the surface , '' BP senior executive vice president Kent Wells told reporters at BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . \n`` So we do have oil and gas coming to the ship now . '' \nNot all of the oil was being trapped , however . \nWells said it was too early to say how much had been siphoned . \n`` This is a good step forward , '' said Satish Nagarajaiah , professor in civil and mechanical engineering at Rice University in Houston , but he said the siphon tool is unlikely to capture more than 15-20 percent of the oil . \nThe Obama administration downplayed the significance of BP 's latest breakthrough . \n`` This technique is not a solution to the problem , and it is not yet clear how successful it may be , '' Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a joint statement . \nPreparations for a maneuver to inject mud into the well to stop the leak for good were ongoing and would be completed in seven to 10 days , Wells said . \nUndersea robots are preparing pipes and hoses around the well to pump up to 40 barrels -LRB- 1,680 gallons -RRB- per minute of mud into the well . \nBP 's best near-term hope of stopping oil from pouring from the well is `` kill mud , '' a heavy mixture of synthetic materials that technicians will attempt to shoot into the well to form a barrier to prevent oil and gas from escaping . \n`` Ultimately it is a winning game that we outpump the well , '' Wells said . \nIf the mud fails to seal the well , BP will attempt to inject golf balls , tire fragments and other materials into the well to clog it up , known in the industry as a `` junk shot . '' \nThe success on Sunday followed a previous setback , when a cord taking the oil to the surface became entangled . \nBP 's earlier attempts to contain the leaking well have been stymied by the technical difficulties of working in the sea floor 's cold , dark conditions . \nOn May 7 , BP tried to lower a containment dome over the leak , but the 100-tonne device was rendered useless by a slush of frozen hydrocarbons that clogged it . \nThe spill began after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers . \nIt threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster . \nPOTENTIAL RISK TO THE EAST , FLORIDA KEYS So far , winds have pushed the giant slick westward and toward shore . \nBut according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the southern edge of the spill could make its way into a powerful ocean current that could carry oil eastward toward the Florida Keys and up the U.S. Eastern Seaboard . \n`` The southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the southwest and potentially into the Loop Current , '' NOAA said on its website , referring to the deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream . \nOfficials have stressed the spill has had minimal impact on the shoreline and wildlife , but oil debris and tar balls were washing up on barrier islands and outlying beaches in at least a dozen places in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi . \n`` As nasty as they are , they are more manageable than a slick . \nThey can be collected . \nThey can be cleaned and we have crews doing that , '' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Luke Pinneo , referring to the tar balls found on Grand Isle , Louisiana . \nScientists and residents of the Gulf Coast say a greater concern is the anticipated encroachment of oil into the environmentally fragile bayous and marshes teeming with shrimp , oysters , crabs , fish , birds and other wildlife . \nThe New York Times and other media reported scientists had detected huge oil plumes -- large columns of concentrated oil moving beneath the ocean surface -- in the Gulf , indicating the leak could be worse than estimates by BP and the government . \nEstimates of the rate of escaping oil range widely from the official BP figure of 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- , adopted by the government , to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day . \nBP said it had no confirmation of such undersea oil plumes and its spokesman , Andrew Gowers , appeared to dismiss the reports as scientifically unlikely . \n`` It is my observation as a layman that oil is lighter than water and tends to go up , '' Gowers told reporters . \nBP is facing growing political pressure to prove it will pay for all of the costs related to the spill . \nSalazar and Napolitano demanded in a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward that the company make clear its commitment to `` redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill .

'' \nSo far , relatively few animals have been oiled , said Ziccardi , who has responsibility for sea mammals and turtles . \nBut he is not complacent . \n`` We 're prepared for oiled manatees , '' he said . \nWhen it comes to cleaning up the shore itself , decades of oil spills have taught some counter-intuitive lessons , namely that doing nothing is sometimes the best thing -- especially in the case of marshlands -- as cleanup efforts can do more damage than the oil itself . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNo wonder BP refuses to tell -- each barrel is worth royalty money it owes , so the lower the figure BP says is flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , the lower its liability to the American taxpayer . \nWhat a cheap and corrupt company BP is . \nAfter the blowout is plugged and it pays the local economy business losses and the cleanup costs , the company should be sued for royalties as well as being sued for any failings leading to the disaster . \nYou really believe Obama s true intent is to distribute BP s dividends to the people who have been effected by this environmental catastrophe ? \nMore like his true intent is to make sure Wall Street profits handsomely ! \nIt has been leaked out to foreign news that Haliburton had intentionally damaged the oil pipe , but Obama and BP has done everything they can to cover this up . \nSince the day he took office he has extended Bush s radical bills but put it on steroids , or created more new radical bills and has lied to the Americans with a straight face . \nDo your homework , your days of freedom are numbered . \nEven the internet is going to be taxed soon ! \nJay Rockefeller , Internet should have never existed . \nBut of course , they now use terrorist as a scapegoat to limit your freedom ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "31", "time": "2010-06-07", "text": "WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana | Mon Jun 7 , 2010 7:56 pm EDT WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP Plc seeks to double the amount of oil it captures from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well , while the U.S. Gulf Coast will be struggling with the environmental mess from the huge spill for years , the Coast Guard said on Monday . \nCoast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who leads the government 's relief effort , said London-based BP hoped to collect 20,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- per day in its latest effort to contain the worst spill in U.S. history , which has now affected 120 miles of coastline . \nThe figure underscored some scientists ' concerns that the May 27 government estimate of up to 19,000 barrels coming daily from the well a mile under the sea may be too low . \nBP had estimated the flow at just 5,000 barrels a day . \nNeither Allen nor BP gave an estimate of how much oil is still flowing into the Gulf . \nThe 49-day-old spill is causing an ecological and economic disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , and testing Barack Obama 's presidency . \nBP 's latest effort to contain the gushing oil is the first positive sign after a series of failed attempts fueled public anger at the company . \nThe earlier efforts generated initial optimism that an end to the crisis was in sight , but those hopes were dashed when the crude kept spewing out . \nAllen said BP 's latest attempt -- placing a containment cap on top of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor -- appeared to be going `` fairly well . '' \nAllen said cleaning up the oil spill will take at least four to six weeks after the well is eventually sealed -- expected to be in August . \nBut dealing with the long-term environmental effects will take years , he said . \n`` We 're no longer dealing with a large , monolithic spill . \nWe 're dealing with an aggregation of hundreds of thousands of patches of oil that are going a lot of different directions , '' Allen said , stressing the broad dispersal of the oil . \n`` Dealing with the oil spill on the surface is going to go on for a couple of months '' once the well is plugged , Allen said . \n`` Long-term issues of restoring the environment and the habitats ... will be years . '' \nObama said after meeting with Cabinet officials at the White House that the economic impact of the spill , which threatens the Gulf Coast 's multibillion-dollar fishing industry , will be substantial . \nHe said the U.S. government would `` ride herd '' on BP to make sure that it paid damage claims from Gulf Coast residents , who have complained that the company is not paying them promptly . \nHe was also pushing BP to be prepared for a possible hurricane in the Gulf . \nThe Atlantic hurricane season , which is forecast to be unusually active this year , began last week , typically peaks in August and ends in November . \nBP said it was preparing a system that , in case of a hurricane approaching , would allow the drillship collecting the oil to disconnect from a pipe that floats up to about 300 feet below the water 's surface and get out of the storm 's path . \nIt is expected to be operational by early July . \nBP shares , which have lost about a third of their value since the crisis began , closed slightly lower in London trading . \nIn New York , BP 's American depositary shares closed down 1.1 percent . \n`` With the right LMRP -LRB- containment cap -RRB- efficiency and surface skimming response , we may have turned the corner on shoreline oil spill volumes , '' analysts at Credit Suisse said in a research note . \nBut there were still signs of investor skepticism . \nGoldman Sachs downgraded its rating on BP to `` neutral '' from `` buy , '' saying the spill would impact the London-based company 's ability to do business worldwide , while Nordic bank Nordea said it had divested all its BP shares , worth about 10 million euros -LRB- $ 12 million -RRB- from its funds . \nContaining the spill is a critical test for BP and Obama . \nImages of birds struggling through oil-soaked waters ringing Louisiana 's ecologically fragile barrier islands and marshes have added to the pressure on Obama , who already faces growing public criticism over his handling of the crisis . \nA new Washington Post\\/ABC poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the government had done a `` not so good '' or `` poor '' job handling the spill . \nJust over 1,000 people were surveyed in the poll , conducted between June 3 and 6 . \nThe new BP effort involves placing a containment cap with a seal on remnants of a pipe at the deep-sea wellhead . \nOil is channeled to a ship for later processing at a refinery ashore . \nBP said it collected 10,500 barrels of oil on Saturday and 11,100 barrels on Sunday , with 27,700 barrels of oil collected between June 3 , when the operation began , and June 6 . \n`` We still do n't know what the flow rate is . \nThat 's the big unknown right now , '' Allen said . \nOne high-end estimate by a U.S. government expert panel puts the leak at 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\\/3 .97 million liters -RRB- a day . \nAllen said BP would send a second rig to the spill site to help capture the oil `` and the combination of these two ... will have a production capability of about 20,000 barrels a day . '' \n`` Our aim is to capture all the oil , whatever that volume is , '' a BP spokesman said in response to Allen 's statement , without confirming the figure given by the admiral . \nA live video feed of the seabed leak shows black crude still billowing into the sea . \nBP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . \nThis is intended to intersect the leaking well and allow it to be sealed . \nAfter contaminating wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , oil has begun to hit some of the famous white beaches of Florida , where the $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry accounts for nearly 1 million jobs . \nAs clean-up crews raked up oil debris and oiled seaweed on Pensacola Beach in the northwest Florida Panhandle , visitors seemed undeterred by the pollution threat . \n`` It 's an awful crisis but we 're really not going to let it ruin our vacation , '' said Jennifer Blow from New Orleans . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nDo n't become BP 's Collateral Damaged , like Exxon s Collateral Damaged . \nMy name is Merle Savage , a female general foreman during the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- beach cleanup in 1989 . \nI am one of the 11,000 + cleanup workers from the Exxon Valdez oil spill -LRB- EVOS -RRB- , who is suffering from health issues from that toxic cleanup , without compensation from Exxon . \nDr. Riki Ott visited me in 2007 to explain about the toxic spraying on the beaches . \nShe also informed me that Exxon 's medical records and the reports that surfaced in litigation by sick workers in 1994 , had been sealed from the public , making it impossible to hold Exxon responsible for their actions . \nExxon developed the toxic spraying ; OSHA , the Coast Guard , and the state of Alaska authorized the procedure . \nBeach crews breathed in crude oil that splashed off the rocks and into the air -- the toxic exposure turned into chronic breathing conditions and central nervous system problems , neurological impairment , chronic respiratory disease , leukemia , lymphoma , brain tumors , liver damage , and blood disease . \nMy web site is devoted to searching for EVOS cleanup workers who were exposed to the toxic spraying , and are suffering from the same illnesses that I have . \nThere is an on going Longshoreman s claim for workers with medical problems from the oil cleanup . \nOur summer employment turned into a death sentence for many -- and a life of unending medical conditions for the rest of Exxon s Collateral Damaged . \nThe new system they are talking about is most likely connecting flow pipe to to the surface from the two valves low on the BOP they used for pumping for days trying a `` top kill '' . \nThat should get another few thousand barrels a day flow and hopefully reduce the leak some to the ocean from the poor seal method they used with the big rubber gasket . \nRubber gaskets are for garden hoses . \nLead or some maleable metal is better for 10,000 psi plus using a compression clamp to squeeze the pipes together and against the lead gasket or liner . \nThe idea is shown here but any variation of a a compression clamp with a soft metal gasket will work . \nEvidence seems convincing that the public has been deceived for way too long on the actual amount of leakage from the blown out well , both before the riser pipe was sawed off , and since then . \nThe latest news is that the diversion to the top is maxed out now , around 15,000 barrels , per day . \nHowever , what if the amount of leakage is double , triple or even more . \nThe oil companies are drilling all the time and know what is the amount of oil coming out naturally from their wells . \nWhy is this one any different ? \nNot only the oil companies but , the USA Govt should be able to nail down much more exactly the amount of oil being emitted . \nFox News today announced that the Govt has been holding back a revised and more honest report , where the oil blowout is way over 30,000 barrels . \nFirst , look at the widespread oil slick and miles of beach now affected , indicating strongly after all that the spill has been super big from day one . \nThis is even after all of the burning , cleanup , natural eradication by sea bacteria , skimming and all else being done to remove oil from the sea and beaches . \nIt is one thing for BP to lie to America , but our own Govt hiding the truth ? \nThat is just inexcusable and constitutes grounds for job firing of any Govt officials that have engaged in such cover up . \nIf Obama has known the truth of the amount of oil spill , but has covered it up , that means impeachment time for him as a supreme act of dishonesty to the American people . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

At some point we need to stop all this cover-up , '' Boxer said . \nWith heavy oil sloshing ashore in Louisiana 's fragile marshlands , heralding an ecological catastrophe , President Barack Obama 's administration faces criticism that it has been too willing to accept BP 's estimates of the gushing oil . \nPopular anger against BP has risen , especially among Gulf Coast residents -- shrimpers , fishermen and tourism operators -- who fear their livelihoods will be devastated by the spill . \nBP 's shares , after initially falling in London trading , closed just over 5 percent up . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward has been quoted recently by British media as playing down the size of the spill and its environmental impact . \n`` We 're not depending on what BP is telling us , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN . \nSteve Wereley , associate mechanical engineering professor at Purdue University , said most independent estimates of the spill flow were `` considerably higher than BP 's . '' \n`` This is not rocket science , '' Wereley told a U.S. congressional panel on Wednesday . \nBP spokesmen said the original 5,000 bpd estimate was given by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nSalazar said BP was responsible for damages so getting accurate data was essential . \n`` It 's a grave and a very serious situation and we 're taking nothing for granted , '' Salazar told NBC 's `` Today '' show . \nWildlife and environmental groups have accused BP of holding back information on the real size and impact of the growing slick and on the quantity and toxicity of dispersants being used against the oil , both above and below the water . \nA BP spokesman said the company had received a letter from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking it to switch to other dispersants . \n`` We are looking at what we can to do to comply , '' he said . \nThe spokesman was responding to a Washington Post report that said the EPA informed BP officials late on Wednesday that the company had 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of chemical dispersants to break up the oil spill . \nThe report , citing government sources , said U.S. officials worried about the environmental impact of the dispersants . \nSheets of heavy oil came ashore in Louisiana 's wetlands on Wednesday for the first time since the rig exploded a month ago . \nThe marshes are nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make Louisiana the top commercial seafood producer in the continental United States . \nFishing is banned in a large part of the Gulf waters because of the spill . \nIn Pass-a-Loutre , La. , thick sheets of gooey brown oil swamped islands of marsh grass at the southern tip of a Mississippi River channel on Thursday . \n`` To see the extent to which it is oiled and and the depth into the island is stunning , '' said Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation 's Coastal Louisiana Restoration Project . \nThe oil pollution covers only a fragment of the vast network of waterways , channels and islands that make up the Delta region , but environmentalists fear it is just the start . \n`` It 's going to take a long time for us to recover from BP 's mess , '' boat captain Richard Blink said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBP has sucked many in our Federal Government in as co-stewards in this mess . \nNow the smirks from many of the Jerks in BP have got folks in the USA fuming . \nAnd the trickle down effect has finally got those in DC wondering what could be next ? \nMaybe the loss of their jobs ?????? Look at this plan pass it around to those in Oil and Gas for real then get some buy in and make BP stop the oil and gas before it is too late . \nTo all concerned about our future : The following has been sent along to BP without a response . \nYet today BP is stating they will try to do a similar thing but not in an oil field way of doing . \nThat does not surprise me they have been doing things left handed and sideways since all this began . \nI suggest for All that can -- pass this along to BP stressing on them to do the right thing this time To stop the oil and gas from flowing into our Gulf of Mexico . \nWhat is at stake ? \nBret Hume FOX NEWS spin master said he could see No Oil . \nGot to watch the mainstream media propaganda spin masters they get their orders from the top of the heap . \nIf you think that way may you set back and think about who we are up against The biggest buck folks in the human history , the Rockefellers and Rothschild s -- then think along those lines asking Are we really sovereign people ? \nThe operators of Reuters must pass this along to the Rothschild s who own Reuters as soon as possible . \nThe games that some are playing at BP will in the end cause a ruckus too hard to mend . \nI proposed this plan a week ago the oil and gas could have been stopped by now . \nYet the mum boo jumbo way this crisis is being handled in the USA is a fault of guilt s that will go back and keep going back until trials are held and many responsible for the lacks found in their actions will put them in jails . \nMany have not a clue yet I do . \nTo whom it must concern at BP Should I have enough facts about the conditions where you are working , consider this : get a design You have all the dimensions then get an overshot made to fit the top flange looking up where the riser was affixed . \nGet 5,000 feet of heavy weight 7 or better casing loaded on board for the overshot to be attached . \nThe casing string should be arranged as this : 1 . \nOn the bottom the overshot 2 . \nNext up 3 or more high pressure check valves to resist the flow of gas and fluids up to the rig installing . \nNext install 1 or more high-pressure pump out plugs to begin unloading the loss circulation material and heavy weight mud whatever that might be . \nWhen installing the casing fill the casing as needed with loss circulation material and heavy weight mud as best designed . \nDesign a cut off charge to be used to separate the drill string from the riser with intent to have it fall away out of the overshot to be installed . \nUse the roves to set the charge off at the best time after installation of overshot is underway . \nShould it not fall away as expected then a grapple can be used to pull out of the way . \nAfter setting the overshot around the top flange the rubber goods installed will compress . \nInstall cementing plugs as needed and begin pumping as needed . \nI believe the entire amounts of fluids and solids will go quickly into all exit points at this time . \nThe cement should be pumped down to the setting ring . \nShould it not go down then close in -- - let set until cement has had time to dry . \nAfter that time -- - to release the rig a charge could be set at the depth where cement is in the setting casing -- the remainder can be pulled up and hopefully the nightmare will be ended . \nI have high hopes that the BOP SUB SEA WELL CONTROL SYSTEM IS STILL UP RIGHT . \nNow , this is a good idea much better than the current plan that is NOT SANE or SOUND AT ALL -- - NOW my thoughts and ideas are worthy of payment , please advise when we can come to terms . \nDwight Baker PO BOX 7065 Eagle Pass Texas , 78852 tel 830-773-1077 Retired Oil and Gas Engineer with USA PATENTS high-pressure gates valves . \nBanking Universal Commercial Code number E67344656 My genetic roots go back to J.D.

'' \nThe statement followed allegations earlier in the day that BP had engaged in a `` cover-up '' about the extent of the damage and the amount of crude flowing unchecked from its ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nTV images of oil sloshing into Louisiana 's marshes has underscored the gravity of the situation and raised public concern and anger about the unfolding catastrophe , keeping it high up on the political agenda in Washington . \nBP shares closed up one percent Thursday but the markets have raked around $ 30 billion from its value in the month since the rig explosion , which killed 11 workers and sparked the disaster-in-the-making . \nBP said Thursday it was siphoning 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day of oil from the gusher , from 3,000 barrels a day previously . \n`` The oil plume escaping from the riser pipe has visibly declined today , '' BP spokesman Mark Proegler said after the company announced that a mile-long tube was tapping into the larger of two leaks from the well . \nHowever , live video feed of the leak , provided by BP , showed a black plume of crude oil still billowing out into the deep waters . \nBP has been estimating the leak was flowing at a rate of 5,000 barrels per day , but scientists and the government have questioned that figure . \nScientists analyzing video of the oil gushing from the seabed have pegged the spill 's volume at about 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day . \n`` It 's just not working , '' U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer , who heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , told CNN as she watched the BP video . \nThe California Democrat denounced a `` cover-up '' of the real size of the oil spill . \nU.S. Representative Edward Markey , who requested the footage , was also unimpressed . \n`` BP has stonewalled on releasing the video for 23 days . \n... If you look at the video you can see plumes of oil spilling into the Gulf far in excess of 5,000 barrels per day , '' he told reporters in Washington . \nProegler and other BP spokesmen made clear the increased containment , while an advance , was not siphoning all the escaping oil . \n`` We 're not claiming that we stopped it -- although that is our final objective . \nWe 're saying that this is what we 're capturing now , '' he said . \nThe U.S. government , grappling with a potentially huge environmental and economic disaster , also said Thursday it would not rely only on data provided by BP , but would make its own checks on the magnitude of the leak . \nIn other developments , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered BP to identify safer dispersants within 24 hours that can be used to contain the spill . \nThe EPA Thursday directed BP to begin using this safer dispersant within 72 hours . \nIf BP can not identify an available alternative dispersant , the company must provide EPA and the Coast Guard with the reasons they believe no other dispersant meets required standards . \nThe use of dispersants , including those manufactured by Nalco Holding Co. , at such high rates and at such deep levels has set off alarm bells with some environmentalists , who worry the chemicals may have a lasting negative impact . \nSheets of heavy oil came ashore in Louisiana 's wetlands on Wednesday for the first time since the rig exploded a month ago . \nThe marshes are nurseries for shrimp , oysters , crabs and fish that make Louisiana the top commercial seafood producer in the continental United States . \nFishing is now banned in a large part of the Gulf waters because of the spill . \nIn Pass-a-Loutre , Louisiana , thick sheets of gooey brown oil swamped islands of marsh grass at the southern tip of a Mississippi River channel Thursday . \n`` To see the extent to which it is oiled and the depth into the island is stunning , '' said Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation 's Coastal Louisiana Restoration Project . \nThe oil pollution covers only a fragment of the vast network of waterways , channels and islands that make up the Delta region , but environmentalists fear it is just the start . \n`` It 's going to take a long time for us to recover from BP 's mess , '' boat captain Richard Blink said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nTo do so we must let the crisis reveal the solution rather than just looking to the patterns of the past . \nSo far these efforts of the past have led to failure and a growing menace . \nLet us observe the Biblical magnitude of this event by taking full responsibility for our mind , our actions , and the world . \nThe action and reaction of BP has been absolutely pathetic ; Any barrel\\/day number they give us next should be multiplied by 10 . \nThis is gonna get ugly ; and its not even closed yet ; BP is still trying to re-coup what they 're going to lose in the cleanup efforts by siphoning off `` 3000 barrels\\/day '' -LRB- Which is probably a high end estimate by BP -RRB- All in all just another day in the office for BP ... . \nBP is obviously lying about the magnitude of the gulf oil spill to keep investors buying stock at such a low price to help finance the clean up . \nEvery negative story headlined on Google Finance under NYSE : BP , is quickly removed . \nI 've noticed that on a daily basis . \nSomeone is obviously removing the negative stories or requesting their removal . \nThis spill is very dangerous to both the economy , as well as to the entire ecology surrouding the gulf , and shore . \nI do not understand how investors can not recognize this . \nThe spill is obviously more then 5000 barrels a day . \nIt is not just one scientist speaking out , but plenty . \nBP and the Coast Guard barred reporters from the coast to take pictures . \nThis spill is definitally more then the 1989 Exxon Mobil , and it has definitally surpassed the Q1 profits . \nThe Atlantis platform is going to be shut down due to a law suit which is crucial for their profits , but theyre also being sued for conspiracy . \nBP has too long been eating til they were fat while neglecting safety responsibility . \nIts besides the fact the oil has been spilled GREATLY into the ecology . \nBut what about the 11 lives that were lost ? \nI think not only the public has spoken , but the government is embarassed by BP . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nBut it turns out he did have an opinion about future judgment about past actions . \n`` I 'm confident that people are going to look back and say that this administration was on top of what was an unprecedented crisis . '' \nDid he regret calling for expanded offshore drilling before the spill ? \nObama said he continues to believe that `` domestic oil production is an important part of our overall energy mix , '' but is insufficient to meet future needs , which is why investment in clean energy is needed . \nA handful of oily sand grabbed from a Louisiana wetland brought back some strong memories for Earl Kingik . \nAs a traditional hunter and whaler in Alaska 's Arctic , it reminded him of the Exxon Valdez spill . \nAs he and other tribal leaders toured the U.S. Gulf Coast for signs of the BP oil spill , they worried that what 's happening now in Louisiana could happen if offshore drilling proceeds off the Alaskan coast . \n`` There 's no way to clean up an oil spill in the Arctic , '' said Kingik , an Inupiat tribal member from Point Hope , Alaska . \nCompared to Louisiana , where the waters are relatively calm and cleanup equipment and experts are nearby , the Arctic Ocean is a hostile place for oil and gas exploration . \nThe Arctic leaders made their pilgrimage to the Gulf Coast as part of a campaign to block planned exploratory drilling by Shell Oil in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas . \n`` What I saw was devastating out there , '' Martha Falk , the tribal council treasurer of the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope in Alaska , said after the Gulf Coast tour by seaplane , boat and on foot . \nIf the same thing occurred off Alaska , she said , `` We would have to wait days and days and days for -LRB- cleanup -RRB- equipment to reach our area . '' \nMay 24 , 2010 21:58 UTC The message from the White House podium today was loud and clear -- there is no magic fix for the oil spill that looks like curdled chocolate milk flowing on top of the Gulf of Mexico . \nAnd there is n't much that anyone can do that BP is n't doing . \nCan government push BP out of the way if it believes the company is not doing the job ? \n`` Well , to push BP out of the way would raise a question -- to replace them with what ?

So there 's not much by way of lemonade likely to come out of the lemons of this disaster , but President Barack Obama promised to work overtime to limit the economic damage to affected communities and to try and make sure that jobs created to clean up the mess would go to local residents . \n"}

{"id": "347", "time": "2010-05-27", "text": "As one of the country 's worst environmental catastrophes unfolds on his watch , President Barack Obama is under increasing pressure from lawmakers and residents of the fouled Gulf coast to take over the oil disaster response . \nThe word at the White House is that Obama is frustrated at the delays BP has encountered in stopping the leak . \n`` Plug the damn hole , '' he has told senior government officials . \nThe most immediate concern is stopping the leak . \nThe problem for the White House is that it has no real alternative except to rely on BP 's technology and expertise to do it . \nThat means Obama is forced into an uneasy alliance with BP -- outraged that the leak took place but hopeful that the energy giant can stop it . \nHas the Obama administrations ' response to the Gulf oil spill been enough ? \nTake our poll and share your thoughts below . \nDo you approve of President Obama s response to the Gulf oil spill ? \nShould the federal government be ordered to take over operations from BP ? \nPHOTO : U.S. President Barack Obama talks after touring the Coast Guard Venice Center in the Gulf of Mexico region to view environmental damage caused by the sinking of BP 's oil and gas Deepwater Horizontal drilling rig while in Venice , Louisiana , May 2 , 2010 . \nREUTERS\\/Larry Downing The BP executives that knew `` harm could come '' BEFORE the spill occurred and did nothing stop it , should be fired . \nBP is criminal and should be treated as such . \nTheir continued rape of our planet is ridiculous . \nSomebody needs to stand up to them NOW . \nIF we listen to the GOP these are our choices : 1 -RRB- Lower taxes and smaller government with limited leadership that allows industry to write it 's own rules that are backed up by taxpayer funded bailouts . \n2 -RRB- Higher taxes to fund bigger government that is capable of bailing out private industries when they are incompetent to deal with problems they cause ? \nThe GOP does n't care about America or our health and safety . \nThey are only capable of playing politics and have no real ideas , as usual . \nIdeology is not what America needs now . \nThe BP-Tansocean-Halliburton disaster is a perfect example of why we need to regulate all industries more closely and protect the environment and the Amercian public from those who seek only to profit from it . \nYou 're rating Obama on this ???

' \nIt 's not our problem ! \nDrill baby ... DRILL ! '' \nObama is at fault until his administration brings criminal charges . \nThen he 's still at fault until the BP decisionmakers are in prison . \nObama is the best president EVER ! \nHe is the clear reason why I only vote for Democrats . \nThankfully Obama is in office for 8 years , so he can clean up the mess the Republicans created -LRB- everything bad that happens in the nation\\/world can be and will be attributed to Bush for the rest of time -RRB- only to hand off to the next Democratic president . \nMy only concern is that the next president must be far , far more liberal . \nRemember : Only liberal Democrats need to be in office . \nThey will help , protect , and give you what you need\\/want . \nOnly they can save America . \n`` Do you approve of President Obama 's response ... ? '' \nShould n't it be `` ... the Obama ADMINISTRATION 'S response ? '' \nOr is the questioner seriously asking one man to do it all . \nEven with 911 and Kartina , no one asked Bush to handle everything ; we asked FEMA Director Michael -LRB- `` Heck of a job , Brownie '' -RRB- Brown to be competent and so forth . \nThe same standard needs to apply here . \nThe EPA and applicable agencies ' responses should be at issue , not those of one man . \nAnd most laughingly , `` Should the federal government be ordered ... ? '' \nSeriously , who wrote these ? \nIt reads like a failed high school assignment . \nWhat would the Tea Party do if they were in charge ? \nWhat have the GOP leaders , who are continually re-elected by voters in the Gulf States , been doing with all the royalty money they collect from oil & gas companies for the privelege of drilling there ? \nThey should have a huge slush fund put aside to deal with emergencies . \nInstead , the GOP leasdership looks to the Feds to save them . \nThe same thing would be true in Alaska . \nAsk Lisa Murkowski what type of emergency fund she has developed with all her roaylty money ? \nWhat a bunch of lying hypocrites . \nA death sentence for GOP incumbents is the only answer , and maybe brain transplants for the voters who keep electing these shills . \nThere are two parts to the question : 1 -RRB- Capping or stopping the release of oil from the well-head ; As to the first : BP has what expertize there is and should be `` point '' with Gov ' t oversight . \nIn this regard , President Obama gets a `` c '' grade for his response . \nAs to the second , Clean-up : President Obama gets a `` F '' grade . \nObama and his team should have been like stink on sh_t , from day 2 ; the Army Corps should have been building sand dikes outside of beach and marshes ; Coast Guard and Navy should have been deploying booms and skimmers in concentric rings around the platform\\/up-welling areas . \nThe Gov ' t should have taken over the clean-up and backcharged BP . \nBP should be barred from operating in US waters until they can pass a re-application test which would involve them building a full scale rig at a test site -LRB- NOT IN US WATERS -RRB- where government scientists and engineers could run any accident scenarios they wanted for at least TWO YEARS ! \n-LRB- a -RRB- because they lied about the readiness of the ` blowout preventor ' -LRB- b -RRB- did n't do sufficient testing with government inspectors on site 100 % of the test time . \n-LRB- BP should have demanded this ! -RRB- \n-LRB- c -RRB- they ignored operational warnings about the overall performance of the rig . \nand -LRB- d -RRB- the most damning of all : BP had no DEMONSTRATED contingency plan for the case where the ` blowout preventor ' failed ! \nthe government should impose a ` three strikes ' law for all industries working with food or in environmentally sensitive areas based on three level contingency plans . \nif all of the plans fail for any test scenario , then you 've ` struck out ' and you 're out of the game until you can pass a vastly more rigorous re-application test regime . \nI believe JBorrow is on to something . \nThe fact all this is so under-regulated is amazing ! \nWe -LRB- the US -RRB- are so greedy with oil and our unwillingness to sacrifice -LRB- god forbid -RRB- our SUV 's and lackluster efforts to improve efficiencies nationwide . \nHopefully this administration will finally move forward on reducing emissions so our great grandchildren have clean air ... and in doing so lessen our ridiculous dependance on Oil , as we clearly go extremes , despite environmental impacts to our oceans , wildlife and eventually our own food source . \nThis administration is doing far more then has been done in the past , though his concessions to the republicans have lessened the effectiveness of certain policies , its still a huge leap forward . \nThe oil companies have made more money they know what to do with , and zero interest in safety . \nI believe serious regulation should be implemented , and hopefully this will be a final wake-up call for those who believe large industries should be left to run rampant in a free market society . \nwait , OB did his part ! \nhe held up a tarball ! \nI hope some one HEARS this we can build ships in a day at war , and I say we are at war with this oil leak that BP loves because it means there is alot of oil for them . \nThere are PLumes of oil that a tanker already fitted with pumps can suck up IT just takes a 100ft piece of pipe , Also we can build a scimmer ship and scim 12 inches of the top of the ocean treat -LRB- pull the oil out then keep the oil spit out the water there are ways and this is a war against this oil which is still coming out into the ocean soon to reach around florida and ruin much more . \nThe Russians blew there run away oil hole to bits may be it is time to do the same not like they did it , but there are ways to just stop it but then BP would lose that hole they already put there , they care much more about that then the ocean death they are creating all day every day and all this other bull is `` being tried -RRB- I really hope someone is hears this , But CORP. will win out again and screw the earth we only live here . \nObama being judged for this is like judging Sara Palin on her intelligence . \nWhat 's he supposed to do ; Dive down there -LRB- with a cigarette in his mouth -RRB- and stuff a sock in the pipe ? \nRegulations and laws had to be in place to authorize a president to act before this happened . \nRegs that Shrub disposed of . \nCan you imagine the screams of SOCIALIST if Obama acted to take over this company ? \nObama 's job is to manage . \nHe is elected to manage this country , and along with this to manage the blow-ups that come up . \nWhere are experts called to testify , where are independant observers , where are other people who did this before ? \nWhile BP is trying to plug the hole , where is the concerted effort to keep the oil from reaching the shore ? \nHe spends his weekend fishing with his pals -- this is not what a good manager should be doing with this kind of an issue to deal with . \nIt is amazing to witness . \nObama attacked for expanding government by Fixed News NeoCon Artists and TeaBaggers and now he is railed against by the same antagonists for not using enough government weight to solve a private enterprise calamity caused by the biggest GOP supporter : Big Oil . \nThe same Big Oil that has paid off our politicians and supported GOP candidates for decades to stave off regulations , and ensure they will keep their obese profit margins ... all in the name of our so called ` free enterprise ' system . \nThe `` DRILL BABY , DRILL '' idiots should be made to take a good long swim in the Gulf . \nOr , as the Fixed News talking heads are shouting , Obama should have the Government do more by identifying every person who was at a Sarah - 'D rill BABY , DRILL ' - Palin rally and force them into work camps along the Gulf until the mess is completely cleaned . \nPerhaps then they would finally open their eyes and see those they support for who they are . \nput your money where your mouth is . \npark your car , oil company haters . \nooh , big oil , it runs the world . \nit rapes the planet . \nwell , put them out of business . \npark your car , if you own one . \nand you better keep hoping the free enterprise system stays . \nit 's the only way faux-prez . \nbarry can skim money for you incopentent libs you cant hold down a job . \n`` The President of the United States could 've come down here , he could 've been involved with the families of these 11 people '' who died on the rig after an explosion , James Carville said on ABC 's Good Morning America . \n`` He could be commandeering tankers and making BP bring tankers in and clean this up . \nThey could be deploying people to the coast right now . \nHe could be with the Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard ... doing something about these regulations . \nThese people are crying , they 're begging for something down here , and it just looks like he 's not involved in this . '' \nHis voice rising , Carville cried out , `` Man , you got to get down here and take control of this ! \nPut somebody in charge of this thing and get this moving ! \nWe 're about to die down here ! '' \nthats sounds like a very innovative idea Dewayne , hope someone hears you out and considers it . \nIt 's not enough to just be angry and frustrated . \nObama needs to spend more time in the affected Gulf States just talking to people -- one at a time -- and trying to help them find solutions to their economic and environmental problems . \nOne of his problems is that common folks do n't see him as relating very well to their real problems . \nDespite his experience in community organizing , he 's seen as detached and aloof . \nInteresting results -LRB- thus far -RRB- : Most respondents think Obama did n't do enough , and most think the government should let BP run the operation . \nPeople , please make up your mind because you confuse me . \ntake it easy lefties . \nyour man obama distanced himself from this disaster in order to not look to be close with that entity most despised by the left ; a `` big oil '' company . \nrather than the posturing of `` keeping our boot on the throat of bp '' , and starting criminal and civil investigations by that incompetent bumbler eric holder , obama would have been better off by taking the high road , and showing some real leadership by offering all the fed govt 's resources to work WITH bp . \ni guess he just does n't have it in him to do that . \nor plouffe , emmanuel and axelrod are advising him not to . \nby the way , getting involved in a crisis is not the same as expanding the government . \nThis is wrong -- -RRB- '' The problem for the White House is that it has no real alternative except to rely on BP s technology and expertise to do it '' They could have an oil spill Czar , and consult with other engineers from the other super major oil companies , Chevron , Exxon-mobil , and verify the correct path . \nBut they have n't even done the first step - appoint someone to be the executive in charge of the federal response , an oil czar . \nWho is in charge when Obama is on vacation or out with the Mexican President ? \nSomeone needs to be in control of the Federal response even if BP is doing their work . \nThe lack of concern from the Obama gross . \nThey are virtually ignoring a spill that is now the largest in US history . \nPrevention is better than cure . \nWhy did n't Boy George 's administration insist all offshore wells have actual working blowout preventers like Norway requires ? \nWhy were they so lax in enforcing what few regulations they were willing to enforce ? \nThis may have occurred on Obama 's watch , but all the preconditions were set in place by the pres and VP from the `` ahl bidniz '' . \nI 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , here . \nThe ` Obama administration ' has but one boss . \nSaying it 's somehow not the PRESIDENT 's responsibility to intervene is pure and utter ignorance of US law -LRB- see below -RRB- and of the role the man is REQUIRED to play . \nYou ca n't blame oil-boy Bush and not blame the federal government under Obama at the same time without what amounts to self-deception . \nYes , of course BP should have had a contingency plan , but Obama is REQUIRED by law to have one . \nOf course Obama didn t cause the blowout . \nIt doesn t let him off the hook . \nUS Title 33 , Chap 40 , SubCh I 2706 & 2711 clearly spell out it s been Obama s responsibility for addressing it since day one . \nThe National Contingency Plan referred is supposed to be in place ahead of time -LRB- not letting industry or previous administrations off the hook . \nThey all bear responsibility , but saying We don t have the tech or training means We all did a pretty lousy job setting up a contingency plan . -RRB- \nThe President , or the authorized representative of any State , Indian tribe , or foreign government , shall act on behalf of the public , Indian tribe , or foreign country as trustee of natural resources to present a claim for and to recover damages to the natural resources The President shall consult with the affected trustees designated under section 2706 of this title on the appropriate removal action to be taken in connection with any discharge of oil . \nFor the purposes of the National Contingency Plan , removal with respect to any discharge shall be considered completed when so determined by the President in consultation with the Governor or Governors of the affected States . \nHowever , this determination shall not preclude additional removal actions under applicable State law If US citizenry decides he hasn t done a good job upholding that responsibility , and most recent polls suggest the majority think he hasn t , then there is opportunity for him to work harder to address that concern . \nWorking with Gov. Jindal is mandated . \nIf Gov. Jindal says during consultation that remediation needs to be stepped up or actions taken , Obama is obliged to listen . \nYell all you like at prior oil-industry-linked administrations , but to be honest a President that ran on environmentally-sensitive statements and just trotted out a new energy plan that \\* supposedly \\* paid close enough attention to risks to justify limited drilling ought not to have been caught with his pants down when a rig accident happened . \nCynics will begin to wonder if he allowed the burden to fall on BP to allow for a mess that proved his prior concerns regarding drilling . \nOf course BP needs to be held liable that s the letter of the law and restating it as if it showed leadership is a bit of a stretch . \nThey lost all credibility sticking to the 5k per day number , which is most likely a crass attempt to avoid the per-barrel charges they know are coming . \nThe message regarding the rather large number of involved personnel and materiel would be a better one for Obama to focus on , but until that stupid hole is plugged nothing else will do . \nIts amazing to me all the Bush bashing that takes place . \nWHAT EXACTLY HAS OBAMA DONE SINCE HE ENTERED OFFICE ????????????????? Do you feel safer in this country ??? He 's got about the same number of crooks in his cabinet as any other president . \nWhat do you expect . \nThe gave Obama the Nobel Peace prize for doing nothing . \n-LRB- Which by the way now makes that once prized award completely worthless -RRB- and now you expect a different result -- - MORONS -- '' YOU '' voted for him , now deal with it . \nObama is all talk and no action . \nWe 'll make sure its fixed in 2012 . \nO and by the way , hows that new `` OBAMACARE '' plan workin for ya . \nTheres nothing like footing the bills for a bunch of illegals and people who dont want to work for a living , but keep working your tails off , millions on welfare depend on YOU !!! The energy companies have serious political clout in Washington ... I am wondering how much they contributed to his election campaign ... and how much he is hoping to garner for the next . \nthe fed should not take over ... . . \n59 % say they do n't approve of the fed 's -LRB- obama -RRB- response How many of the people who voted on this question even know what Obama 's options actually were ? \nBP must cork the leak . \nBP must pay for the cleanup . \nWere the government to say , `` Step aside , sonny , we 're in charge now , '' the taxpayers would end up footing the bill for this . \nObama has done all he could . \nPosted by Fishrl | Report as abusive What CAN he do ? \nHe should wave his hand and just make it stop spewing oil . \nWhere are the Drill Baby Drill people now ? \nWe never should have drilled so close to our shores unless there existed technology to take care of this type of problem . \nWere are the right wing nuts who pushed for off chore drilling ? \nObama has done as much as he can . \nThe environmental wackos pushed America so far off shore . \nWe need to drill closer to shore and on land . \nI 'm sick of leftist nuts dictating the demise of our country . \nWith Obama now so inept , such a socialist pacifist anti-free enterprise , should BP be forced to pay for the La. oil slicks that he would not allow Jindal to build ??? Should Fla. whack him for its spoilage ? \nCan this guy do anything but destroy our capitalistic framework ? \nHis leftist policies have dealt blows to America , our allies , and our citizens . \nYet , the MSM covers for this inept Alinskite . \nSome may be waking up as Dowd , The Post , even some mags . \nwho are asking -- -- Is this the end of Rico ???? The Chicago Thug ? \nI think a `` Bell form '' it will be more exactly for the container . \ndouble walls for presure controle , engines for motion and then central `` sucking pipe '' . \n-LRB- sorry -RRB- engenieers could design the density of fluid to charge `` Bell walls '' . \nhow ever , what 's deep it 's happend ? \nThe plan is to dig another well by the end of August . \nThat 's the plan . \nBurn off the oil inthe meantime and keep cleaning . \nWhat else can they do ? \nGet real about this . \nAmericans want it all today or yesterday . \nThat is a national trait . \nWe are an impatient people . \nDo you expect the CEO to stand on the beach and wait this out , wringing his hands ? \nThey go on with life and do what they have to do . \nThe size of the disaster has grown beyond the Coast Guard to handle . \nIt 's not Coast Guard Admiral 's fault . \nBut the regular military has a far more robust chain of command and far more robust capability . \nPassing the National guard off to the States may appear to give President Obama cover , but the paralysis there hurts him more than it hurts local governors . \nPresident Obama may also be thinking too much like a lawyer . \nSitting back and letting BP continue to screw up might work for a smaller scale problem , but it makes the U.S. government look inept or calloused at the larger scale of the currently understood Gulf Disaster . \nAnother dangerous mistake is for the Obama administration to conclude that since the oil can not really be stopped -LRB- once it is in the water -RRB- that there is no reason to over exert itself as the oil comes ashore or into the marshes . \nBut this is n't what the public needs right now . \nIf the administration were to mobilize troops -LRB- and naval vessels -RRB- directly and on a grand scale . \nI would like to know who are these people that are ever polled about anything ? \nI read today that Obama 's approval rating was lower then ever and that America had lost faith in obama poll by the Washington Post . \nFunny thing is I work with people from nearly every spectrum and most all whom I speak with seem happy with Obama . \nThere are a few who are not but they are usually faithful to the GOP and their bias disqualifies them , as does the few who are far left . \nWould n't it be lovely to see how many people were polled , what the language of the poll looked like and how many responded . \nI would love to see what the Washington Post considers the American People . \nThey have been openly accused of reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims . \nI would advise Reuters to use a disclaimer with anything the Post reports . \nMarcus Brauchli , editor of The Washington Post , wrote in a memo to employees that was obtained by Reuters . \n...

'' \n`` It just points even more strongly for the need for all these technologies to be developed and encouraged . \nThe oil that we make through our process is biodegradable oil . \nIt is made on land . \nYou do n't have those kinds of risks , '' Dillon said . \nA range of commercial-scale projects to develop cellulosic and algae biofuels are ready to be built , but the economic downturn , uncertainty in global financial markets and the lack of long-term U.S. government support is making it hard to raise capital , company officials said in a conference call . \nA massive jobs bill pending in Congress includes a $ 1-per-gallon tax credit for biodiesel retroactive to January 1 and valid through the end of 2010 . \nThe bill also includes a 50-cent credit for fuel produced from biomass . \nMore than 30 biofuel companies and trade associations have asked leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee to extend the cellulosic biofuel production tax credit to at least 2016 , and to make algae biofuel producers eligible , creating a renewable investment tax credit option . \nWes Bolsen , chief marketing officer for Illinois-based Coskata Inc , said the recent move by French oil company Total to take an equity stake in Coskata is part of a growing commitment by oil companies to play a bigger role in advancing biofuels . \nStill , government policy support is critical to move forward to commercial production , he said . \n`` What we have is a technology that is ready today . \nWe believe we can economically compete head to head with gasoline . \nWe need the policy that is going to show we have the enduring commitment , '' he said . \nCoskata , founded four years ago , has a demonstration facility in Pennsylvania that can produce cellulosic ethanol from grass , trash , wood chips , and various crop residues . \nHR BioPetroleum Chief Operating Officer Martin Sabarsky said his company needs more government support if it is to proceed with a commercial algae-based biofuels facility in Hawaii . \nIt has received support from Royal Dutch Shell oil company but is having problems securing needed private capital . \nSabarsky recent discussions with Shell in light of the BP oil spill tragedy have further underscored the need for alternative fuels . \n`` They -LRB- Shell -RRB- have recognized ... that the age of easy oil is over , '' he said . \n-LRB- Reporting by Carey Gillam ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` What I worry about as an energy CEO is what effect this will have on energy policy , '' he said , noting it may lead people to look more seriously at electric cars , or complicate plans to pump carbon underground . \n`` This BP thing has tentacles . '' \nAlong with the public at large , industry players were crossing their fingers on Thursday in hopes the latest attempt to plug the well would be successful . \nDave Roberts , head of worldwide upstream operations at Marathon Oil Corp -LRB- MRO . \nN -RRB- , spoke frankly about everything that went wrong and the looming political fallout . \n`` These things just should n't happen , '' Roberts said , citing the industry 's obligation to keep equipment working and its people safe . \n`` On this particular incident , the industry has failed that obligation , and we 're obviously very concerned about it . '' \nEven energy lobbyists are changing their tack . \nCatherine Reheis-Boyd , president of the Western States Petroleum Association , readily conceded at a debate in San Francisco last week that what happened with the Horizon was a `` game-changer . '' \n-LRB- Reporting by Braden Reddall ; editing by Gunna Dickson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe spill has shown -LRB- once again -RRB- industry promises they will assure safe and environmentally sound operational practices are a sham . \nThe Russians executed the chief of operations at Chernobyl for playing similar games with the reactor . \nThe Supreme Court just gave corporations the right to vote . \nDoes that mean they can also be given the death penalty ? \nThere are a lot of us who 'd like to give BP a lethal injection after this . \nWhile , the reaction of the leading executives to the incident in the gulp is a sign that leadership in the industry is becoming more connected with the possibilities of failures leading to similar catastrophes , much of the responsibility sits with the various boards of directors and the governance procedures which are supposed to guide them . \nThe Basel agreement and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were intended to restore investor and public confidence in the corporate world . \nHowever , while the recent economic crises illuminated the tendency for corporate management to act in favor of short term profit instead of the long term health of the companies in violation of the general ethics framework of corporations , management apparently focused solely on financial adjustments , which have been successful , they neglected the impacts that their businesses have on jobs , environment and safety . \nIt must also be pointed out that not all of the blame lies with management . \nBig corporations do n't get big without support from customers . \nThere are no record profits unless the companies can sell their products . \nSo much of the blame for many of the incidents should be shouldered by the consumers . \nConstructive criticism should always be welcomed and considered , but pointing fingers and expecting large corporations or the government to always fix things is to deny personal responsibility each of us holds during these events . \nWhile we , as consumers complain about the high price of goods and services , in this case petroleum products , we need to ask ourselves what we are actually doing to help . \nIt is certainly hypocritical for us to pass all of the blame , when part of it is ours . \nSo , what can we do ? \nWe can take baby steps and use a little less product . \nIt was the constant use by many people that drove prices up according to basic laws of economics . \nShortage of products creates demand . \nShortage is the mechanism of supply and demand . \nSo drive a little less by combining trips ; use reusable bags during shopping trips ; use a bicycle to commute occasionally ; put trash where it belongs instead of using the ground as a dump which requires more labor and fuel to collect . \nThese actions are small , but multiplied by the population of the US or the world makes a difference . \nAs for me , I just bought a bicycle to make short trips to the store , library , etc. . \nMany people have bikes , but it becomes a status symbol where the clothes are the prettiest , and the act becomes snob appeal . \nIt 's time we put that natural energy source to work . \nOnce we have cleaned up our own act by getting up off our butts and doing something to help , then the complaining carries more weight . \nThis is my perhaps first comment that could be viewed in light of partial defense of BP 's CEO . \nA CEO does n't know what 's going on every second in terms of the workers and bad judgement calls further down the chain of command that are n't relayed back up every second . \nThere is some blame to put here of course . \nI think what will become more of a focus down the road will be the workers whom had knowledge in the weeks leading up to this event -- about the shredded rubber from the seal that an operator had caused by negligence . \nCBS news had an interview with one of the survivors and he hand recounted before the explosion -- that an operator had through human error , caused mechanics to basically shred a rubber seal . \nThis was most likely hid from the higher ups including the CEO to save jobs within the company from the company , which makes this all the more depressing when it comes to the industry . \nSome basic questions will have to be asked . \nDid we stop flying all planes when one pilot was found to be drunk ? \nDoes any airline condone that ethical practice ? \nDoes any employee that engages in that act , after the fact inform his higher ups out of moral obligation if not caught ? \nIf that kind of act kills people or causes a lot of damage , do we scrap airplanes ? \nThat kind of relation to put this in perspective shows how one person can damage an entire process\\/industry . \nSometimes in `` a domino effect '' the first domino is n't always the one on top , but one that was over looked . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe Obama administration ordered a halt in new drilling permits after BP 's oil rig , owned by Transocean -LRB- RIG . \nS , exploded in the Gulf on April 20 . \nSome U.S. lawmakers have called on the administration to lift the permit ban , at least for exploration in the shallow waters of the Gulf while keeping it in place in deeper waters where BP was operating . \nMike Breard , an analyst at Hodges Capital Management , said the decision would force companies to move rigs to places such as Brazil , forcing the United States to import more and increasing the possibility of tanker accidents . \n`` You 're trading a risk of one type of spill for another type of spill , '' Breard said . \nObama has established a presidential commission to investigate the causes of the spill , which by government estimates is the country 's largest ever . \nHis announcement on Thursday was meant to amplify his administration 's response before that panel draws its own conclusions on what went wrong . \nThe moratorium on permits to drill new deepwater wells will continue for a period of six months while the commission does its work . \nPolitical fallout has not been limited to legislation . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar said Liz Birnbaum , the head of Minerals Management Service , which oversees U.S. offshore oil drilling , had resigned . \nObama said he had learned of the resignation on Thursday morning . \nHe declared that reforms are needed in the government 's process for approving oil drilling permits and said the MMS suffered from a relationship with the oil industry that was `` scandalously close . '' \nObama has come under increasing pressure to stop the spill and halt its environmental and economic consequences for Gulf states . \nBP , which has been publicly scolded by the president , was working on Thursday to plug the leaking well in a procedure known as `` top kill . '' \nObama promised to hold BP accountable in the catastrophic spill and said his administration would do everything necessary to protect and restore the coast . \n`` We 're exploring any reasonable strategies to try and save the Gulf from a spill that may otherwise last until the relief wells are finished and that 's a process that could take months , '' Obama said . \n"}

'' \nHe announced a six-month extension of a moratorium on permits for new deepwater oil drilling while a commission investigates the causes of the disaster , and ordered 33 deepwater exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico to suspend work while they meet new safety requirements . \nThe move is a setback to offshore exploration and a potential blow to Obama 's efforts to rejig U.S. energy policy . \nThe political fallout from the spill also claimed its highest-profile victim as the head of the government agency that oversees offshore oil drilling resigned . \nAll eyes are on the top kill , the pumping of heavy fluid into the well to stop the gusher before sealing it with cement . \nBP stopped pumping to analyze data , but resumed later Thursday , said BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles . \n`` We have not yet stopped the flow , so the operation has not yet achieved its objective , '' said Suttles at a briefing . \nNews of progress on plugging the spill , coupled with a nearly 4 percent rise in oil prices , lifted shares of the companies most closely tied to the spill . \nBP shares gained nearly 6 percent in London trading . \nNervous investors have wiped about a quarter , or $ 50 billion , off the energy giant 's market value since April . \nMillions of gallons of oil have poured into the Gulf since an April 20 blast on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and triggered the spill , soiling 100 miles of coastline , threatening some of the country 's richest fisheries and endangering a fragile ecosystem already battered by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \nThe destruction of both the local economy and a way of life was taking an emotional toll , even on elected officials . \nLouisiana Congressman Charlie Melancon broke down crying as he spoke to a House subcommittee meeting in Washington . \nLocals who saw President George W.

{"id": "2089", "time": "2010-05-18", "text": "WASHINGTON | Tue May 18 , 2010 7:56 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. Congress is turning its focus this week to the federal government 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but the offshore oil drilling industry is far from off the hook . \nCongressional pressure on federal agencies , especially the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , is likely to lead to tighter rules for the oil and natural gas sector . \nThe Senate Homeland Security committee kicked off a series of hearings examining the government 's role in the cleanup of the massive oil leak threatening the U.S. Gulf Coast on Monday with testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson are scheduled to answer lawmakers ' questions regarding the rig disaster on Tuesday . \nExecutives from BP Plc and Transocean Ltd will also face more congressional grilling this week . \nBP is already facing legislation that would make the company pay more for the economic damages resulting from the rig accident . \nMeanwhile , the White House last week offered its own legislative plan to pay for the spill . \nFollowing is a look at some of the new laws and regulations that may result from the spill . \nFacing attacks for not doing enough to prevent the rig disaster , the Interior Department last week announced it would change the way it oversees offshore drilling . \nIn addition to separating the Minerals Management Service 's oil royalty collection and safety inspection roles , the department is reviewing environmental permitting procedures for offshore oil production . \nAs part of the shift , the Obama administration has asked for an additional $ 29 million to pay for more inspections of offshore platforms and a review of procedures . \nThe overhaul is expected to lead to stricter regulations of offshore drilling . \nWith the agency coming under heavy fire for allowing BP to bypass some environmental studies , there will likely be more stringent environmental analysis and oil spill response plans . \nRegulators will also likely establish more rules regarding the equipment and techniques used in offshore oil production . \nThe current focus on faulty blowout preventers and well cementing procedures as a possible causes for the accident will likely lead to more standards in those areas . \nInterior has placed a moratorium on any new offshore drilling permits until at least May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . \nAny significant extension of this moratorium could have a major impact on offshore drilling companies and lower projected Gulf oil production . \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs chairman Joseph Lieberman said on Monday that until questions surrounding the preparation and response efforts for this deepwater oil spill are answered , the government should not allow any new deepwater wells to be permitted and drilled . \nSome lawmakers from coastal states have also called for a complete halt to offshore drilling in any new areas , saying the risk is just too great for coastal economies . \nStill other lawmakers are still looking to expand offshore drilling , but with additional protections in place . \nThe Senate climate bill released last week would allow U.S. states to prohibit offshore oil activity within 75 miles of their coasts . \nLawmakers in both chambers have proposed bills that would raise the amount of money BP would be required to dole out for economic losses caused by the spill to $ 10 billion from the current cap of $ 75 million . \nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday said a $ 10 billion liability limit would be `` inadequate , '' however . \nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the cap will be lifted , it is almost certain that BP and other oil companies drilling offshore will be responsible for covering much more than $ 75 million in economic losses in the future . \nThere are also likely to be changes to the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , authorized for use in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nLawmakers are considering raising the 8 cent per barrel fee the industry pays to support the fund by 1 to 25 cents . \nThe White House proposal released last week would increase this per barrel fee by 1 cent . \nDemocratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced legislation that would impose an annual fee of $ 10 for every acre leased for offshore drilling to raise money for clean energy transportation technology . \nLautenberg said the fee could raise $ 1.8 billion a year . \nThe additional fees and liability risks could hurt smaller oil and natural gas operators offshore that may not be able to handle the costs . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOn April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . \nThe same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . \n-LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . \nWe have to ask who was in charge of MMS while Ken was in Boston ? \nDo we trust our government ? \nThe federal government aka the Mineral Management Service gave the Cape Wind permit while the Gulf of Mexico was being destroyed . \nThe MMS permits should all be reviewed including the ocean wind permit ! \nMMS spent more time on the Cape Wind permit while they could have been doing their job in the Gulf What they should be focusing on is how to stop the leak ... there will be plenty of time to point fingers and fix the system later . \nI do n't understand why this has n't been resolved , if I had the particulars -LRB- design drawings -RRB- and pictures of the piping I could already have designed a solution -LRB- or two -RRB- ... the fact that the leaks continue is mind boggling ! \nWell you do n't have to me a expert to know that the oil will soon get into the Gulf Stream and at 5 miles per hour . \nA little onshore winds and the whole east coast of Fla first then the USA will have tar balls floating up on its beaches . \nAnd BP that says it will pay for all bills related should have 10,000 workers daily till every freken ball is picked up . \nLarger problem they probably have 20 more wells with same defective blowout valves ... . . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nBP 's share price has fallen around 18 percent since news of the fire at the drilling station on April 20 , while Exxon shares were largely unchanged after the force majeure announcement . \nThe largest operator in Nigeria , Royal Dutch Shell has clashed with the Nigerian government for decades following numerous spills in Africa 's largest energy producer . \nShell said in a statement on its website that its Nigerian joint venture cleans up oil spills as quickly as possible , no matter what their cause , but is sometimes delayed by security concerns or because some communities deny access . \nThe Anglo-Dutch major said the volume of oil spills in Nigeria for its joint venture was almost 14,000 tonnes last year , the equivalent of around 280 bpd , mainly because of militant attacks on facilities . \n`` It -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- is without doubt the worse place for BP to lose their political capital , '' said James Marriott , oil and gas analyst at environmental organization Platform . \n`` If the U.S. administration gets aggressive against BP , then it 's a problem for them offshore , onshore in terms of shale gas , for conventional gas , refining , some cross-border projects with Canada and further afield . '' \nIn the United States , BP 's massive spill and the risk of an environmental catastrophe could have implications throughout the industry as it has reopened the debate about deepwater drilling . \nAnalysts say , however , the world is hugely dependent on deepwater drilling to secure oil supplies . \nThe ExxonMobil force majeure relates to shallow offshore oil , but much of West Africa 's crude production , like that in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , is deepwater . \nAnalysts say it is unrealistic to veto deepwater drilling if the world 's oil needs are to be met . \n`` Perhaps in terms of health and safety regulation -LRB- things will change -RRB- , but not in terms of drilling , '' said Angus McPhail of Wood Mackenzie consultants . \n`` It is not really feasible to stop drilling altogether as long as there is good demand for the product ...

'' \nThe Obama administration put a six-month ban on deepwater drilling in place following the massive oil spill at BP 's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico in April . \nThe government is currently working on a report offering recommendations on possibly lifting the moratorium , which could be completed by the end of the month . \nBirol said there was little evidence oil prices between $ 70 and $ 80 a barrel -- the range they have traded in for most of the last three months -- were damaging the economy , but he warned producing countries it would be dangerous for them to try and push prices higher . \n`` We do not have the evidence to say if prices around $ 75 are hurting the economic recovery for now , but if it goes above $ 80 a barrel it will be a definite risk to growth in some OECD countries and may even strangle the recovery before it really gets underway , '' Birol said . \n`` Between $ 75 and $ 80 , we have ample spare production and spare capacity . \nIf oil prices go to $ 100 , this will send a clear signal to oil importing countries that they need to speed up conservation efforts . \nBirol was speaking to Reuters ahead of a press briefing at the United Nations in New York on Tuesday evening where he will present with the IEA executive director , Nobuo Tanaka , a report on steps needed to end energy poverty in the developing world . \nBirol said conservation and substitution efforts have become more difficult as the vast majority of oil demand growth over the past five years has come in the transportation sector where there are few viable alternatives for now . \nAdditionally , most growth has been centred in countries such as China , India and those in the Middle East , where oil products are subsidised so consumers do not feel the full impact of rising prices . \nA surge in oil prices back to $ 100 could change that , however , he said . \n`` While most growth in oil demand over the last five years has been in the transportation sector - for which there are no viable alternatives for now -- the U.S. , UK , Germany , China and Japan are all increasing support for the move towards electric cars , '' Birol said . \n`` If the price goes to $ 100 , these efforts will accelerate . \nThat would not be good news for oil exporters .

'' \nThe report is scheduled to be officially released on Wednesday . \nIt follows findings released by the White House oil spill commission last week that said workers at the companies did not cut corners on safety to save money . \nThe scientific panel 's report is critical of BP 's choice to use a long-string well design in a deep high-pressure well . \nIt also questions the decision not to run a bond log to assess the stability of cement in the well . \nThe companies involved with drilling the Macondo well have all traded blame over responsibility for the rig accident . \nTransocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , and Halliburton , which did cementing on Macondo , have both charged that BP 's well design was a major factor in the explosion . \nBP has denied these claims , instead faulting Halliburton for a flawed cementing job on the well . \nBP and Transocean also disagree on who was in charge of interpreting the pivotal negative pressure test , which indicated severe problems with the well . \nBut the report does not explicitly assign company fault for various mistakes that occurred in the run-up to the accident . \nTransocean and Halliburton did not immediately respond with comment on the report . \nRegarding the cementing , the report cited several possible reasons it may have failed , including the type of cement used and the decision to use only six centralizers . \nIn addition , the multiple government agencies overseeing drilling operations were unclear about their specific duties creating gaps in oversight , the report said . \nInterior Department inspectors also were not sufficiently trained to enforce deepwater drilling regulations , it said . \nThe Interior Department commissioned this report from organizations in the National Academy of Sciences , which advises the federal government on medical and scientific policy . \nThe panel 's final report is due in June 2011 . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWhich is safer a deep water oil drilling or a nuclear reactor ? \nOr should we turn off all our lights and computers and never drive anywhere . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` That 's when I decided to get it out in a more creative way , '' Daley said by telephone from Columbus , Ohio . \nBP 's conduct before and after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon blowout prompted the move , Daley said . \n`` I 've been in business for 12 years , and I know mistakes happen ... but with the violations they 've had and not having a backup plan ...

{"id": "107", "time": "2010-06-01", "text": "President Barack Obama , struggling to get on top of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , vowed an overhaul of U.S. laws and regulations needed to prevent a repeat of the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 people and triggered the spill . \nA mile below the ocean surface , BP began a new strategy to tackle the six-week-old drama , using underwater robots to cut away extraneous pipes before trying to contain the leaking oil and channel it to a ship on the surface . \nAfter meeting co-chairs of a commission that will investigate the accident , Obama raised the prospect of criminal prosecutions . \n`` If our laws were broken leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is that we will bring those responsible to justice on behalf of the victims of this catastrophe and the people of the Gulf region , '' Obama said . \nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in New Orleans that the U.S. government has launched a criminal probe and that federal agencies , including the FBI , are participating . \n`` We will not rest until justice is done , '' Holder told reporters . \nThe Justice Department will look for violations of the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold violators liable for cleanup costs and reimbursement for government efforts . \nThe oil giant 's shares in London closed down 13 percent on Tuesday , at 430 pence , after falling by as much as 17 percent . \nIn New York , BP 's American Depositary Receipts lost nearly 15 percent to close at $ 36.52 . \nThe shares were hit hard by weekend news that its latest attempt to plug its blown-out seabed well had not worked , sparking fears oil could leak into the Gulf until August . \nBP shares have lost more than a third of their value , or about 46 billion pounds -LRB- $ 67 billion -RRB- , since the leak started . \nThe cost of dealing with the crisis now totals $ 990 million , and is rising . \nShares of other companies with stakes in the well were also down between 10 and 19 percent , including Anadarko , Transocean , Cameron and Halliburton . \nAt the same time , the cost of protecting the debt of what was once Britain 's biggest company against default rose sharply . \nThe five-year BP credit default swap widened by 71 basis points to 173 basis points , CDS monitor Markit said . \nThe cost to protect Anadarko , Transocean and Halliburton debt also soared . \nAnalysts were increasingly gloomy about BP as an investment , with one issuing a sell order and saying he thinks the company will be broken by the crisis . \nA poll by CNBC , a Wall Street news channel watched by many savvy U.S. investors , said that 63 percent of those surveyed say BP will be fine in a year , while 25 percent believe the company will be under bankruptcy protection and 12 percent think BP would go under . \nBut the White House said BP had the resources to cover the financial costs of the disaster . \n`` You 've got a company with the type of market capitalization that can and will fully pay for the damage caused by the disaster they are responsible for , '' spokesman Robert Gibbs said when asked at a briefing if the Obama administration was concerned the spill could ruin BP financially . \nIn the next attempt to contain the leak , robotic equipment will use giant shears and a diamond saw to cut a pipe 35 feet above the wellhead that will allow BP to sit a dome on top of it and funnel oil to a tanker on the surface . \n`` We are intent on minimizing the flow of the oil into the Gulf and we 've begun a series of operations to ensure just that , '' BP managing director Bob Dudley told CNN . \nIt could take up to 72 hours to get the containment device operational , said Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup . \nIf this attempt fails , it is possible that up to 19,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 800,000 gallons\\/3 million liters -RRB- a day will leak into the Gulf until relief wells , due in August , are completed . \nThe leak is a financial and public relations nightmare for BP and its problems are just beginning . \nHolder , the U.S. attorney general , and top Justice Department officials met state and federal prosecutors from Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi and afterward announced that the criminal probe was under way . \n`` We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law , '' Holder told reporters . \n`` Our environmental laws are very clear . '' \nOBAMA VOWS LAWS , REGULATION OVERHAUL Obama , who is fighting accusations that he has not reacted swiftly enough to a disaster that threatens Louisiana 's multibillion-dollar seafood industry , sat down with the heads of a commission looking into the leak -- former Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly . \n`` If the laws on our books are insufficient to prevent such a spill , the laws must change . \nIf oversight was inadequate to enforce these laws , oversight has to be reformed , '' Obama said . \nThe commission will be similar to those that examined two previous unprecedented U.S. catastrophes -- the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 . \nThe fate of BP 's shares weighed on investors but was of little concern to residents of Louisiana 's coast , who have suffered crippling losses because of the closure of some Gulf waters to fishing . \n`` I really do n't care much about it , '' Kimberly Mertz , who works at a marina in rural Venice , Louisiana , said of the share price . \n`` We want to get everything cleaned up . '' \nThe slick has spread over 100 miles of Louisiana 's coast , but Mississippi and Alabama have escaped so far with only scattered tar balls and oil debris reaching their coasts . \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said moderate southerly and southwesterly winds this week may start moving oil closer to the Mississippi and Alabama coasts . \nThe forecast was a reminder that oil from the unchecked spill , broken up and carried by winds and ocean currents , could threaten tourist attraction Florida , and Cuba and Mexico . \nCommercial boats recruited to the oil spill response were being deployed to increase monitoring of the Alabama coastline , and skimming vessels were responding to confirmed reports of oil . \nBeach support teams were also being mobilized in anticipation of oil coming ashore . \nRaising the stakes still further , Tuesday was the official start of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , which forecasters predict may be the most intense since 2005 . \nThat year Hurricane Katrina ravaged the region and disrupted offshore oil and gas output . \nExperts fear a big storm could drive more oil ashore and force BP and the U.S. government to suspend cleanup efforts . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nInstead , I read hundreds of blogs blaming Obama for this disaster and `` not acting quickly enough . '' \nI suppose that people want him to personally swim to the site and fix it . \nThen , they would be happy . \nWhy would anyone think he is not . \nBut , think about his predicament , too . \nHe had to spend a year fixing our economy and healthcare system . \nHe had to rely on the fact that deregulation has led to corruption , and at any moment , another one of our great , greedy , messy constructs can collapse . \nLike banking , healthcare , etc. collapsed . \nSo , Americans are bereft in a land of greed , and desperate to blame anyone except those who are truly to blame . \nIf the government talks about regulating , everyone screams `` BIG GOVERNMENT '' or `` SOCIALISM !! '' . \nBut if the Government does n't maintain a fleet of deep-water ROVs , oil men on-staff , drill rig on standby , etc. then people complain that the government has n't taken over the spill response . \nYou ca n't have it both ways people . \nSeveral other oil companies and independent oil consultants have been asked and they all said this is exactly what should be done . \nEvery thing they are trying carries increased risk of making the problem \\* worse \\* . \nCutting off the BOP in an attempt to install a shut-off valve is a huge risk : the BOP may be partially closed and thus cutting it off may release more oil , or worse -- cause catastrophic failure of the cement casings , in which case expect as much oil leaked per day as we have been getting per week up until now . \nIn that light , it makes perfect sense to try less risky things first . \nI also find it amusing that people have such short memories : The Bush administration is responsible for the mess the MMS has been in and the lack of oversight of drilling operations . \nWith the economy , two wars , et al I do n't know how people expect 8 years of de-regulation to be magically un-done and all the messes cleaned up overnight . \nIt takes years to change the direction and culture of any large organization . \nNationalize BP 's property inside the U.S. , seize its assets in U.S. banks , declare martial law on its property and begin liquidating it to pay for this fiasco . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1525", "time": "2010-06-01", "text": "HOUSTON | Tue Jun 1 , 2010 3:05 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Last Wednesday , five weeks into the worst oil spill in U.S. history , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward locked himself in a room on the third floor of the British oil giant 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . \nFor the next five hours , Hayward , BP executives , senior engineers and the U.S. Energy Secretary and Nobel Physicist Steven Chu , who had flown in two days earlier , grappled with the latest plan to stem the thousands of barrels of oil a day gushing from a broken well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe scheme was called `` top kill '' and involved pumping heavy drilling fluids , known as drilling mud , into the blown-out well to stifle the flow of oil and allow the top of the well to be sealed with concrete . \nThe technique had worked to seal other wells , but never one out of control in 5000 feet of water . \nThere was a risk that the extra pressure caused by pumping in mud could rupture the top of the well , and increase the amount of oil gushing into the sea . \nEven so , Hayward and his team gave the plan a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . \nQuietly , they hoped an end to the devastating leak -- and BP 's five week-long , media-saturated nightmare -- might be within sight . \nThe room they worked in measured about 30 feet by 30 feet and is normally used for training sessions . \nBP 's crisis unit had commandeered it and renamed it the `` intervention room '' soon after the leak began . \nCables wrapped in yellow tape with the word `` warning '' written on it , snaked from the ceiling to the cheap , white laminated tables , which were crammed with laptops . \nMaps of the Gulf and diagrams of the equipment on the seabed covered the thin walls . \nNext door , in an almost identical space called the `` containment room '' , a separate group of engineers worked on strategies to capture the oil that had already leaked . \nThe team in the intervention room pored over the results of tests to see if the well could take the pressure . \nThe mood was `` intense '' , BP 's director for the Americas Bob Dudley told Reuters in the narrow , artificially-lit corridor outside the room during a break in deliberations . \n`` It 's kind of like NASA and the Apollo 13 mission in there . '' \nThe uber-calm Dudley is n't normally given to hyperbole . \nHe was formerly the head of TNK-BP , the British firm 's joint venture with a group of Russian oligarchs , until the billionaires turned hostile and Dudley was forced to flee the country . \nHe talks about that experience with the emotion of an oil man discussing his wife 's choice of make-up . \nIn Houston that afternoon , though , there was a flicker of tension in his eyes . \n`` It 's pretty dramatic , '' he said . \np.m. , as a crowd of employees dressed in button-down shirts , casual golf shirts and cotton pants , gathered outside to wait for a decision , Hayward gave the green light and a call was made ordering the vessels above the site of the spill to start `` top kill . '' \nAs drilling fluid flowed into the top of the well , morale in the command center lifted . \nUnfortunately for BP and for everyone else , top kill misfired . \nIf this were a NASA moment , it would have been more like the Challenger disaster than Apollo 13 . \nWith BP 's stock price plummeting and analysts predicting the leak could last until August when a relief well is completed , the stakes are starker than ever : for Hayward , his globe-straddling company and , of course , the waters and beaches and wetlands of the Gulf . \nOn top of the technical challenges of stopping a gushing oil well , BP must contend with a public that is growing angrier by the day as well as an increasingly frustrated , and criticized , Obama administration . \nThe White House has come under intense political pressure to take charge of the disaster -- even if it is not entirely clear what the president could do apart from stepping up rhetoric and taking a harder line on the company . \nIn short , instead of getting easier , the coming few months will likely be even more dauntingly complicated for BP and its press-shy boss . \nDuring four days inside the Houston command center and traveling with Hayward to the site of the oil leak late last week , Reuters got an up-close picture of a company under siege . \nIn the hours after `` top kill '' began , BP workers in Houston seemed busier than they had in the previous two days . \nA sense of quiet hope filled the offices . \nSome people even smiled . \nBP 's headquarters , a 20-story office block in west Houston , houses the firm 's permanent crisis center , which handles the response to things like hurricanes . \nThere are now between 500 and 600 people , including staff from Exxon , Shell , Anadarko and Chevron , working in the center , which operates around the clock . \nShifts last 12 hours , though a handover period means most are at least 13 . \nOn the landscaped campus outside , ducks and geese play in man-made ponds and multistory car parks are crammed with top of the range muscle cars , high-end SUVs and European luxury saloons . \nThe intervention and containment rooms sit at the heart of the command center . \nThere 's also `` the hive '' , which has blacked out windows and a video wall broken into multiple screens . \nThe screens show different views of BP 's remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROV -RRB- -- the miniature submarines at work thousands of feet below the Gulf . \nAbout a dozen workers in the room talk to ROV operators on vessels around the spill site , communicating through microphones that hang from the ceiling . \n`` It 's kind of like kids with video games but with much bigger risks , '' BP senior vice president Kent Wells said . \nFurther along the corridor , inside the `` simops '' or simultaneous operations room , engineers coordinate the movement of the vessels involved in the crisis effort . \nOn the day `` top kill '' began , more than a dozen large vessels , including drill ships , supply vessels and platforms were huddled in a one mile radius directly above the leaking well . \nIn an alcove along the long corridor that connects all the rooms , BP has laid on massage therapists for workers . \n`` When you 're working people as hard as we are , you have to provide some stress relief , '' Wells said . \nThe afternoon `` top kill '' began the two massage chairs were empty . \nMost of the workers in the command center are white , middle-aged and male . \nThe few women present mostly fill support roles such as executive assistants or receptionists . \nU.S. accents are supplemented with Norwegian and British ones -- experts flown in from around the world . \nTo make it easier for workers to know what their colleagues do , some wear red singlets with their roles stitched on the back . \nThe center also houses a group of U.S. Coast Guards . \nDressed in navy blue uniforms and heavy black boots , they are there as a reminder from Washington that the government is a part of the response effort . \nBut the Guards are often left with little to do . \nOn the day `` top kill '' began , they confined themselves to a tiny windowless room along the corridor , seemingly unbothered by what was happening around them . \nSeveral hours after mud began pumping into the well , Hayward emerged from the intervention room in what has become his trademark open-necked shirt . \nFlanked by the head of Britain 's largest financial public relations firm and by his own head of press , a former editor of the Financial Times , Hayward gave a brief update to Reuters and a local TV new crew in the `` simops '' room . \nBehind Hayward , five large flat-screen televisions streamed video from the sea floor . \nOn one , drilling mud was seen gushing from the well head while another screen showed a yellow panel with dials and controls and , in red letters , the name Cameron International Corp , the Houston-based company which manufactured the failed blowout preventer that BP initially blamed for the oil spill . \nUnder pressure from Washington , BP had added a video stream of the leaking oil well to its website . \nWith `` top kill '' underway , Hayward cautioned against anyone trying to interpret changes in the size of the plume of oil as indication of success or failure . \nNot everybody listened to that warning . \nOne BP insider said a few days later that there were `` hedge funds trading the plume '' . \nHayward looked strained , and sounded cautious . \n`` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' he said . \nThe April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which was drilling the Macondo oil prospect -- named for a fictitious down-at-heel town in a number of Gabriel Garcia Marquez stories -- killed 11 workers and triggered the disastrous oil leak . \nSo far , it has also lopped about $ 65 billion off BP 's market capitalization and hit industry plans to expand deepwater drilling in the Gulf and in other parts of the U.S. . \nAs the environmental disaster drags on , it is likely to have a profound impact on the way Americans and others view deepwater drilling . \nAt first , BP responded to allegations that it had cut corners and put savings ahead of safety by diverting blame to its partners in the Gulf well . \nNow it says it is solely focused on stopping the leak . \nBehind the scenes , though , BP workers have taken on a defensive , even defiant , mood . \nAn employee who walked into the command center canteen last week found colleagues watching CNN . \n`` So are they accusing us of covering stuff up again ? '' \nAs public anger has grown , BP 's press team has taken to routing all media calls straight through to voicemail , in part because of the volume of calls urging violence against Hayward . \nThe worst abuse comes in the early hours of the morning , press officers say , when callers appear to have had a few drinks . \nLouisiana-born political consultant James Carville has regularly demanded that President Barack Obama tell BP `` I 'm your daddy '' and suggested that Obama might be inclined to shoot Hayward given the chance . \nPeople posting comments on U.S. newspaper websites have called Hayward a `` jerk '' with a `` toffee-nosed accent . '' \n`` I understand perfectly why everyone is angry and frustrated that this leak has not been stopped , '' Hayward told Reuters late last week . \n`` I am angry and frustrated . \nI want this thing stopped as fast as I can , as we can . \nWe want it stopped and we 're doing everything we can to stop the damn leak and we 're going to continue to do everything we can to stop the damn leak . \nThe reality is that 's it 's a very challenging technological challenge . '' \nAN ENGLISHMAN AND A PRESIDENT IN THE BAYOU Two days after `` top kill '' began , Hayward touched down at Houma airport in Louisiana after a one-hour flight from Houston in a white Falcon corporate jet . \nHe hopped into a Chevrolet Suburban -- black with blacked out windows -- and made the short drive across the parking lot to a trailer , where a group of medics tested the respiratory function of everyone booked to fly out to the spill site by helicopter . \nHayward , his executive assistant and a press officer then drove the 100 yards back to the heliport , a gray one-story building whose waiting room consisted of prefabricated cabins bolted together . \nAs Hayward left Houston earlier that morning , President Obama had arrived in Louisiana to meet with the Coast Guard , state officials and to visit a local beach . \nThe slow-motion disaster has not spared the White House . \nOpinion polls say 60 percent of Americans are unhappy with the government 's response . \nMany in the Gulf region think the government should have acted more quickly to stop the oil spreading and should be doing more to help the thousands employed in the fishing industry . \nThat 's the view of Carol Terrebonne , who sells shrimp to the public from a cramped roadside office in the steamy Louisiana shrimping hamlet of Golden Meadow . \n`` I blame both -LRB- Obama and Hayward , -RRB- '' Terrebonne said a day after Obama 's visit to the state . \n`` They should have done more before the oil got into our marshes . \nThey could have brought in big skimmers right away . '' \nUnder a bright blue sky on Friday morning , Obama and Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen , the president 's point man on the spill response , met with local officials on an otherwise deserted Fourchon beach . \nA sign at the entrance to the beach read `` Have fun , be safe and help keep our beach clean . '' \nThe president walked to the edge of the water , which was lined with brightly colored oil-absorbing plastic sponges that looked a bit like cheerleader pompoms as well as a long thin tubular boom designed to catch the oil . \nAfter chatting with officials , Obama called the press over and pointed out the gooey black balls that had washed up on the sand . \n`` If you can see these little balls , these are the tarballs they were talking about , '' he said . \n`` Obviously , the concern is that until we stop the flow , we 've got problems . '' \nStanding beside the president was Charlotte Randolph , LaFourche Parish President . \nRandolph regularly fished from the beach , Obama explained . \n`` We want to be sure she can come back . '' \nA reporter asked the president if the tar balls might be natural . \n`` We attribute all oil that you see right now to BP , '' said Randolph . \nLater that day , Obama was asked how confident he was that `` top kill '' would work . \n`` All I can say is that we 've got the best minds working on it and we 're going to keep on at it until it is plugged , '' the president said . \nTHE WORLD WE LIVE IN Hayward is one of those minds . \nA geologist by training , he joined BP out of university and rose to the top job in May 2007 . \nHis predecessor , Lord John Browne , was forced to step down after admitting he had lied in a court bid to stop a British newspaper printing details of a gay affair . \nBrowne 's star had already been tarnished by a 2005 explosion at BP 's Texas City operation , which left 15 workers dead and which the safety regulator blamed on cost cuts initiated by the CEO . \nPipeline leaks in Alaska a year later , which BP admitted were caused in part by cost cutting , and delays on key projects , added to the company 's woes . \nHayward is known by colleagues for his keen focus on the nuts and bolts of oil production . \nA few months after taking over , he declared that BP 's operational performance was `` terrible . '' \nVowing to change the way the company worked , Hayward said he would standardize and streamline the way BP did everything from drilling wells to ensuring safe working conditions . \nThe BP boss has a full head of dark brown hair and a boyish face . \nThis , and his normally relaxed down-to-earth manner mean he could easily pass for someone a decade younger than his 53 years . \nAs the crisis has dragged on , though , his face has begun to look more drawn . \nThe night after `` top kill '' began , he worked until 4 a.m. , he had no sleep and then headed off to do breakfast television . \n`` I want to stop this thing as soon as anyone , '' he told Reuters . \n`` I want my life back . '' \nUnlike the camera-friendly Browne , Hayward is uncomfortable with media attention . \nMany in the United States have criticized comments he made early in the crisis that seemed to downplay the spill . \nUnfamiliar with the American political environment , Hayward has struggled to strike the right tone . \n`` The U.S. , has a tendency to politicize and ... sensationalize bad news , '' says John Hofmeister , the former head of Shell Oil Company , the U.S. division of Hague-based Royal Dutch Shell , the world 's second-biggest publicly listed oil company . \n`` For foreign-based executives to throw themselves into that debate , they do n't know the territory , they do n't know or understand how the dynamics work . \nThey have a great deal of difficulty appreciating the nuances . '' \nStill , BP officials have pushed their boss to become even more visible , and in recent days he has started to give regular TV interviews . \nOn his first trip out to the Discoverer Enterprise , a drill ship from which a failed early attempt to tackle the spill had been conducted , Hayward was accompanied by a Reuters reporter and photographer and by a three-person ABC camera crew . \nAt the heliport in Houma waiting to board a large yellow Sikorsky chopper , Reuters asked him how he was coping with the blanket news coverage and round-the clock interview demands . \n`` We live in the world we live in , '' he said with a sigh . \nBP 's world is changing rapidly . \nObama has extended a moratorium on new deepwater wells and announced stronger regulations on existing drilling . \nCredit Suisse estimates BP 's cleanup costs could reach $ 9.8 billion . \nLegal challenges are likely to add billions more . \nAnalysts have even begun speculating whether BP might be prey to a takeover bid by Shell or Exxon Mobil Corp , a move that industry executives have in the past consistently dismissed as unlikely to gain regulatory approval . \nBP has made a bad situation worse thanks to crucial early missteps . \nIn line with early estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates , the company initially said that 1,000 barrels of oil a day were spilling into the Gulf , before increasing that to 5,000 barrels a day . \nBut as some scientists began to estimate a much higher flow rate , and especially after BP started to capture 5000 barrels a day of crude from the leak , even as thousands more barrels continued to spill into the ocean , many in Washington and around the country accused the company of covering up the extent of the spill . \nBP 's credibility took a further hit early last week when an independent U.S. government-sponsored panel said that the oil leak was likely discharging between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels a day . \nThe panel , which reported its findings on May 27 , estimated that between 650,000 and 700,000 barrels of oil had already spilled into the Gulf , easily surpassing the 260,000 barrels the Exxon Valdez discharged when it ran aground in Alaska 's Prince William Sound . \n`` As upset as we are about the oil spill itself , we are also upset that we are not getting proper information from BP , '' Miles Grant at environmental group the National Wildlife Federation told Reuters . \nEarly on , Hayward tried to distance BP from the well failure , telling Reuters in an interview on April 30 that `` this was not our accident '' . \nHe repeated this message for days . \n`` This was not our drilling rig , it was not our equipment , it was not our people , our systems or our processes , '' he told the BBC on May 3 . \nThe blame , he said , was better pinned on the maker of the blowout preventer or on Transocean , a publicity-shy company that BP hired to drill the well and which moved its headquarters from Houston to tax-cutting Switzerland . \nBut documents released by the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce , which is investigating the accident , have highlighted BP 's input into the design of the well and the role BP managers played in how drilling was conducted . \nSenator David Vitter said that BP had seemingly `` made enormous mistakes and probably cut corners . '' \nThat 's certainly what many along the Gulf coast believe . \n`` I blame the BP engineers who cut corners , '' says Rick Murdoch , 61 , a charter boat captain out of Alabama who had planned to fish Louisiana waters in May and June but now faces a bleak season . \nFueling the sense of outrage , a report by the Department of the Interior 's Inspector General detailed a culture of corruption in the Minerals Management Service , the agency supposed to oversee offshore drilling . \nObama said last week that the relationship between U.S. regulators and oil officials had been `` scandalously close '' . \nStanding on the deck of the Discoverer Enterprise last week , drips of perspiration rolling from the rim of his white plastic safety hat , Hayward appeared uncomfortable with the subject of blame . \n`` I am not going to speculate on half facts , innuendo and spurious gossip . \nWe need to wait for the facts and then we can determine who was at fault , at what time , but most important : how do we ensure it does n't happen again ? '' \nForty nine hours into `` top kill , '' the chopper ferrying Hayward , a Reuters reporter and photographer and the ABC crew to the Discoverer Enterprise , took off from Houma and flew south across the vast Mississippi Delta . \nThe lush green wetlands a few hundred feet below were crisscrossed by canals cut by the oil industry decades earlier to facilitate drilling just offshore . \nLater , when the drills and rigs moved far out from the coastline , there was no need to go through the swamps . \nBut the damage to the Delta has never been repaired . \nHayward remained optimistic about the latest attempt to control the leaking pipe . \nAs well as the regular `` top kill '' process , BP had tried a `` junk shot '' , injecting heavier materials , such as shredded rubber and golf balls , into the well in a bid to block it off . \n`` We have wrestled it to the ground but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , '' Hayward said above the roar of the rotors . \nAfter landing on the Enterprise , which is about the length of three American football fields and resembles an oil tanker with a giant derrick fixed on top , Hayward met officials from BP and Transocean . \nIn the waters around the Enterprise sat dozens of ships and vessels working either to stop the leak or prevent the oil spreading . \nHayward said there were between 1,000 and 1,500 people in the immediate vicinity working to stop the flow . \n`` This is the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my almost 30 years in the oil industry , '' he said . \nBP 's representative on the Enterprise , which had been drilling nearby when the Deepwater Horizon exploded , is George Walker , a tall Texan with 37 years experience in the oil industry . \nHe explained to his boss what had happened after the rig blew . \n`` We did everything we could , '' he said , his bottom lip quivering . \nLater , when a reporter asked Hayward if the technology to stop the leak should have been developed earlier , a hint of defensiveness crept into the BP boss 's voice . \n`` We have the technology . \nWe just have n't had to deploy it in this situation as this situation has not occurred in 20 years in drilling in the deep water . \nSo the technology 's here and we 're deploying it . '' \nOn Air Force One on the flight back to Chicago that afternoon , Obama 's spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters that the president was optimistic about `` top kill '' . \n`` We 're hopeful and I think we 'll know over the course of the next many hours where we are , '' Gibbs said . \n`` The president believes that we 're making progress . '' \nLooking down from his chopper on the still waters of the Gulf , Hayward , too , remained hopeful . \nHe had seen the strips of rainbow-colored sheen and patches of brown -- crude-oil mixed with dispersant -- but preferred to focus on the wider ocean . \n`` There 's a lot of clear water , '' he said , almost as if he was convincing himself that things would get better . \n`` You can see some silver sheen here but most of the area is surprisingly clear in this location .

{"id": "72", "time": "2010-05-26", "text": "Special report : Civil fine in Gulf spill could be $ 4,300 barrel NEW YORK | Wed May 26 , 2010 8:25 am EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Just how many barrels of oil are gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon spill is a billion dollar question with implications that go beyond the environment . \nIt could also help determine how much BP and others end up paying for the disaster . \nA clause buried deep in the U.S. Clean Water Act may expose BP and others to civil fines that are n't limited to any finite cap -- unlike a $ 75 million limit on compensation for economic damages . \nThe Act allows the government to seek civil penalties in court for every drop of oil that spills into U.S. navigable waters , including the area of BP 's leaking well . \nAs a result , the U.S. government could seek to fine BP or others up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked into the U.S. Gulf , according to legal experts and official documents . \nSo far , analysts and experts calculating potential oil spill liabilities have mostly concentrated on the cost of the clean-up and compensation for economic damages to affected parties . \nSome have also discussed criminal liabilities . \nBut the potential for civil fines has received scant attention -- and they could add up very quickly , depending on how aggressive the U.S. government is in pursuing them . \nThe threat of hefty fines underscores the importance of quantifying how much oil is pouring into the Gulf . \nAs BP seeks to staunch the leak that has now been gushing for at least 33 days , it has estimated a spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day . \nBut some experts say the volume -- and hence the fines -- could be more than 10 times higher . \nThe little-known , seldom applied clause in the Clean Water Act was added in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , and was intended to beef up the arsenal of penalties the government can apply to oil spillers to deter future disasters . \n`` These civil penalties could be staggeringly high , possibly running into the billions , '' said Professor David Uhlmann , director of the Environmental Law program at University of Michigan . \nTotal liability -- including civil fines as well as the cost of clean-up , economic damages and potential criminal liability -- `` will run into the billions and may be in the tens of billions , '' Uhlmann said . \nUnder the Clean Water Act , the Environmental Protection Agency can seek in federal court to fine any party whose negligence results in an oil spill in U.S. federal waters . \nOther companies involved at the Horizon platform and the oilfield could share liability with BP , experts said . \nThey include rig-owner Transocean Ltd , cementing contractor Halliburton Co. , blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron , and Anadarko and Mitsui , which also hold stakes in the oilfield . \nThe basic fine , according to the act , is $ 1,100 per barrel spilled . \nBut the penalty can rise to $ 4,300 a barrel if a federal court rules the spill resulted from gross negligence . \nThe fines were originally set at $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 but that was raised in 2004 to keep up with inflation , according to Tracy Hester , head of the Environmental Law and Policy program at the University of Houston . \n-LRB- To see an EPA memo on 2004 revisions to penalties outlined in the Clean Water Act , click here : here -RRB- It is unclear , however , that the EPA would try to apply the fines , or seek maximum penalty levels . \nEPA officials did not respond to several calls and e-mails requesting comment . \nIf the agency does act , the per-barrel fines could push oil companies ' liability well beyond the cost of cleaning up the spill and paying legitimate claims for economic damages it causes , experts told Reuters . \n`` There are civil fines that could be quite substantial . \nI think BP 's exposure to this is far greater than people initially thought , '' said Harvard Law School professor Jody Freeman , who recently served in the White House as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change . \nBP has already said it will voluntarily exceed a $ 75 million cap on liability for economic damages , pledging to pay any `` legitimate claim '' it receives . \nBut the civil fines are another wild card . \nBP spokesman Mark Salt said the company had nothing further to add to what it has said about the costs of the oil spill response . \nCash raised from such fines would be funneled to government pollution funds , which provide economic aid for hazardous material spills . \nBP or other parties facing fines could appeal them , or try to settle with the government for a lesser amount . \nAnother option would be for BP or other responsible parties to seek a far-ranging settlement covering various areas of liability . \n`` The amount of barrels being released from the well is going to be critical , '' said Hester of the University of Houston . \nUnder pressure over the government 's response to the disaster , President Barack Obama last Friday created a bi-partisan commission on the spill , and the administration has pledged to independently verify the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf . \n`` We 're not depending on what BP is telling us , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN last week . \nAfter past oil spills , experts said , civil fines have comprised a modest proportion of total liability , but they said the magnitude of the Gulf spill may lead the government to seek unprecedented penalties . \nIt is common for the government to wait until an oil spill clean-up is well underway before pursuing civil penalties , experts said . \nAuthorities would also need an accurate accounting of the spill volume before seeking the fines . \nBernstein Research estimated in late April that BP 's liability could reach $ 8 billion , but that figure did n't include any potential penalties . \nBP 's stock price has plunged by around 30 percent since deadly explosions rocked the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20 , setting off an oil leak that may become the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history . \nAn EPA legal document leaked online and viewed by Reuters shows the agency evaluated applying per barrel civil fines on BP for a 5,000-barrel oil spill in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay in 2006 . \nThe EPA and U.S. attorneys declined to confirm or deny the contents of the document , which was found on a whistleblower website called peer.org . \nWhen the penalty clause was introduced into the Clean Water Act by Senator Joseph Lieberman 16 years earlier , he argued that caps on spill liability might lead oil companies to take undue risk . \n`` Large civil penalties ... are also especially important because , in certain cases , the liability of the spiller for clean-up costs under federal law is limited , '' Lieberman told Congress in 1990 , according to congressional records . \n`` Aggressive penalties may need to compensate for this limited liability , '' he told Congress at the time . \nIf BP 's estimated spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day is accurate , responsible parties could face civil fines between $ 5.5 million and $ 21.5 million per day , depending on levels of negligence . \nBP 's net profits in the first quarter of 2010 were around $ 6.7 million per day . \nOther companies may share responsibility and face a portion of the civil fines , lawyers said . \n`` I would expect the government to go after BP and other parties for the maximum civil fines , '' said William Bode , managing partner at the Bode & Grenier law firm in Washington . \n`` The case could be brought in a Louisiana court where it would most likely succeed , although it might be settled for less than the maximum . '' \nAny gross negligence ruling against BP or others could depend on whether the companies knew they were taking undue risks in the Gulf , lawyers said . \n`` If a driller like BP knew or should have known about a condition that could lead to a disaster , it might face gross negligence , '' said a lawyer and insurance underwriter who does business with BP and asked not to be named . \nIf the government pursues civil fines based on the volume of oil spilled , it would take into consideration whether companies have made their best effort to mitigate the spill , their prior history of offenses , if any , and whether they can bear the cost of fines , among other factors , experts said . \nBP received the third-largest criminal penalty , of $ 50 million , for an environmental offense in U.S. history for a Texas City refinery fire in 2005 . \nBP subsidiaries remain under federal probation for prior offenses in Texas and Alaska . \n`` There 's only so much blood you can get from a stone , '' Uhlmann said . \n`` I do n't think bankrupting BP will be the goal . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIn a world that offers multiple renewable resources this oil spill and the irresponsible actions of BP should stand as deacons for how AFFORDABLE change can be . \nPlease ... 4300 per barrel ... as if we have never seen the long term damage and clean up of MINOR oil spills . \nI 'm just a small businessman in Florida but I have a sound idea on stopping the leak in the well . \nIs there someone who will listen to just a regular guy ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "2162", "time": "2010-05-26", "text": "HOUSTON | Wed May 26 , 2010 7:46 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said an ambitious deep-sea operation to choke off a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was proceeding as planned on Wednesday , while President Barack Obama cautioned Americans there was no guarantee it would work . \nBP is under intense pressure from Obama to bring a swift end to the five-week-old leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe and a blow to Obama 's crisis-manager image . \nUndersea robots were helping to inject heavy fluids and ultimately cement pumped down about a mile to the sea-bed well , while BP chief executive Tony Hayward and U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu monitored operations together in Houston . \n`` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' Hayward said in a media briefing four hours after launching the `` top kill '' strategy to stanch the leak . \n`` It will be another 24 hours before we know whether or not this has been successful , '' he added . \nThe embattled CEO stood by BP 's 60-70 percent odds of success . \nBut top kill , a routine procedure on the surface , has never been attempted at such depths , prompting one industry expert to put the odds of success at less than 50 percent . \n`` You have got some of the smartest guys in the business trying to figure this out , but it has never been done before , '' David Pursell , partner at Houston investment bank Tudor , Pickering , Holt & Co , told Reuters Insider . \n`` I think the odds have to be 50 percent or less , '' he added . \nObama said that if successful , BP 's plan to cap the well should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of hundreds of thousands of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of crude billowing into the Gulf . \nIf it fails , `` there are other approaches that may be viable , '' he said on a trip to California . \nObama , who has told aides to `` plug the damn hole , '' will head to Louisiana on Friday for the second time since the April 20 rig blast that killed 11 and unleashed the oil . \nBP says the next approach would be to install a containment device over the broken blowout preventer , a structure at the top of the well on the ocean floor , to try to stop the oil flow . \nIt would attempt this in the next three or four days . \nIt is still unclear how much oil is flowing from the well , but it is already shaping up to be the worst oil spill in U.S. history and a long-term threat to a rich ecosystem . \nThe oil 's destruction of critical habitats continued to spread , with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal saying that more than 100 miles of the state 's 400-mile coastline were now affected . \nA BP statement said the top kill action began at 1 p.m. CST after the U.S. Coast Guard approved the operation , the most ambitious effort to date to cap the well . \nPIVOTAL DAYS FOR OBAMA , BP These days may be critical for the London-based energy giant and Obama . \nBP 's reputation and its big presence in the United States is at stake and investors , who have wiped $ 50 billion off BP 's market value since the start of the spill , will watch closely to see whether the latest attempt to seal the well works . \nBP shares seesawed in London trading , with investors boosting the share price about 2.6 percent at one point before it closed up 1.4 percent . \nBP 's announcement that it had launched the new operation came after London markets had closed . \nIf the effort fails , Obama may have no choice but to take charge of the response . \nHe has so far deflected calls for the government to take a more direct role and said BP has legal responsibility for fixing the mess . \nWhat he can do is unclear because the government does not have its own deepwater tools and technology and will have to rely on BP . \nBut even with Obama applying constant pressure on the company , polls show that nearly half of Americans are unhappy with how he has handled it . \nThat sentiment could play into the November elections that are widely expected to erode his Democratic Party 's control of the U.S. Congress . \nFlorida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said if BP failed to plug the leak this week , Obama must seize personal control of the effort immediately . \n`` If this thing does n't work then the president ought to turn this over to the military . \nIt has the command structure to bring in all the civilian agencies , '' said Nelson . \nResidents of the Gulf region are particularly concerned about the impact of spreading oil on wildlife and area shorelines , home to a lucrative fishing and tourism business . \nBilly Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the worst affected Louisiana coastal districts so far , sharply criticized BP executives and Coast Guard leaders , saying they had no comprehensive plan to defend the coast from the oil . \n`` We will lose more coastline from this catastrophe than from all four hurricanes -- Katrina , Rita , Gustav and Ike , '' said Nungesser . \nCommercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . \nBP said it had appointed an independent mediator to oversee damage claims . \nMore than 26,000 claims have been submitted so far , resulting in payments of more than $ 36 million . \nBP has estimated that about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- have been leaking every day , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 20 times more . \nThe head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Jane Lubchenco , told a congressional hearing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would provide a new estimate within two weeks on the amount of oil leaking from the well . \n`` It 's only been in the last couple of days that we have gotten video that was high enough resolution , long enough length and fast enough shutter speed to really do credible calculations , '' Lubchenco said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nYet , nobody actually says what he should do . \nWhat we 're seeing in the Gulf , is exactly what the GOP , Conservatives , Libertarians , etc , have been whining for , for decades -- - sparse Federal regulation , with Corporations monitoring themselves . \nJust like the financial meltdown , we 're seeing the result of that ideology . \nYet , now they 're whining for Obama to do more -- - for more Federal intervention . \nThe hypocrisy , kind of makes one 's mind explode . \nAnd sadly , due to the Corporate influence of the Federal Government , the Government is n't prepared to do anything . \nThey do n't even have submersibles capable of working at that depth . \nMaybe Obama can dive down there himself , and pump all the GOP hot-air into the well , to equalize the pressure ...

'' \nObama 's Democrats , who control both houses of Congress , are expected to lose seats in the election and want to avoid shifting power to Republicans , who would make it more difficult for the president to achieve his policy goals . \nObama is aware of the government angle in the crisis and has made his displeasure with the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , the Interior Department agency that regulates offshore drilling , very clear . \nThat agency is now being restructured , but other policy consequences loom , most notably the president 's efforts to pass energy legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase domestic production of renewable fuels and -- tricky under current circumstances -- expand offshore drilling . \nJohn Leshy , who served as general counsel for the Interior Department in the Clinton administration , said the spill could hurt Obama 's short-term prospects for an energy overhaul . \n`` Clearly the spill has dramatized the cost of fossil fuels -- coal , oil and gas , particularly oil . \nSo to that extent it has , I think , boosted the idea that there needs to be energy reform , '' said Leshy , now a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law . \n`` But in the short term you have to get 60 votes in the Senate , '' he said . \n`` I think the spill has made that harder . '' \nAn energy bill introduced by Democratic Senator John Kerry and independent Senator Joe Lieberman is languishing in the 100-member legislative body . \nThe offshore drilling provisions were meant to attract Republican support for the bill . \nObama 's action plan for advancing that energy law is not clear , but his strategy for dealing with the oil spill has been to act fast . \nMindful of the political damage incurred by President George W. Bush 's administration for its response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Obama has not wasted any opportunity to show he is moving quickly and assigning blame . \n`` Katrina was a natural disaster . \nThis is a man-made disaster , '' said Ken Medlock , an energy fellow at Rice University in Houston , Texas . \n`` With this particular case , from Day One the Coast Guard has been on the scene . \nThe federal government , as a result , has been involved from Day One . '' \nLarry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia , said Obama had learned from Katrina and made clear BP carried the blame for this Gulf disaster . \n`` Obama has a made-to-order bad guy in BP . \nAnd he sure has n't been hesitant about pointing fingers , '' Sabato said . \nBad guy or not , public anger about the spill has not helped Obama prevail in getting Congress to raise the cap on oil companies ' liability for big spills . \nIt has also given Republicans , whose support Obama needs to achieve his energy overhaul , potential ammunition against the administration if MMS is found to have been negligent . \n`` The president has spent a whole lot of time pointing the finger at BP and you should point a finger at BP and the other companies involved , '' Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' show . \n`` We 're also interested to know what the administration did . \nWas the Mineral Management Service a part of this administration that approved this site ? \nIt also approved this spill response plan . \nWhat kind of oversight did the administration provide during the course of the drilling ? '' \nObama plans to create a presidential commission to answer questions such as these and identify the causes of the spill . \nThe amount of time he has will depend on how soon BP plugs the well , how far the oil flows , and how focused the U.S. public remains on the role of companies rather than the role of the government in this environmental crisis . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBan all offshore drilling . \nImpose consumption taxes on SUV and pick-up trucks -LRB- unless commercially licensed -RRB- Raise taxes on gas to $ 10\\/gallon to deter waste . \nSuffer the consequences , America . \nYour children and grandchildren are going to live in poverty and filth thanks to your greed and gluttony . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nBP 's next planned step is a `` top kill '' -- pumping heavy fluids and then cement into the gushing well to plug it . \nThat operation could start next week , perhaps on Tuesday , BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . \nAdding to the confusion , BP revised downward on Friday an estimate from Thursday that one of its containment solutions -- a 1 mile-long siphon tube inserted into the larger of two seabed leaks -- was capturing 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day . \nA BP spokesman said the amount of crude oil it sucked from the leak fell to 2,200 barrels -LRB- 92,400 gallons\\/350 ,000 liters -RRB- a day in the 24-hour period ended at midnight on Thursday . \n`` The rate fluctuates quite widely on this tool , '' Suttles told reporters at a briefing in Robert , Louisiana . \nMany scientists dismiss an original 5,000 bpd estimate of the total leaking oil -- often defended by BP executives -- as ridiculously low and say it could be as high as 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day or more . \n`` There 's a huge amount of uncertainty around that number and it could have a fairly wide range , '' Suttles said . \nA federal panel will release its estimate of the actual flow rate as early as next week , a Coast Guard official said . \n`` It 's very clear that BP has not been telling the truth , '' Massachusetts Democratic Representative Ed Markey told CNN . \nBP denied any coverup and said some third-party estimates of the leak were inaccurate . \nThe company 's shares fell more than 4 percent in London . \nMichael Gordon , chief executive of Gordon Strategic Communications , a corporate and crisis public relations firm in New York , called BP 's handling of the spill `` a case study in failed crisis communications . '' \n`` It would not have been possible for them to handle this worse . \nThey are not taking sufficient responsibility for what happened . \nThey 've played a game of ` hot potato ' with the other companies involved , '' he said , referring to BP 's public trading of blame with its partners in the drilling of the well . \nA month after the well blowout and rig explosion that unleashed the catastrophic spill , sheets of rust-colored heavy oil are starting to clog fragile marshlands on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta , damaging fishing grounds and wildlife . \nScientists fear parts of the huge fragmented surface slick will be sucked to the Florida Keys and Cuba by ocean currents . \nAt a briefing in Mobile , Alabama , Coast Guard Incident Commander Captain Steven Poulin said an overflight on Thursday of the oil slick showed that while `` minor portions of sheen '' were in the Loop Current there was `` really no trail or elephant trunk '' of oil extending down into the moving current flow . \nMarkey said it was clear BP was only siphoning off `` just a small fraction . '' \n`` BP has mismanaged this entire incident from day one , '' he said . \n`` They should not be trusted . '' \nBP spokesmen say the original leak estimate came from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , one of its federal partners in the joint spill response . \n`` I understand the frustration , '' Suttles told CBS . \n`` We 're supplying information . '' \n`` It 's obvious they are trying to limit information to protect their economic liability , '' said Markey , chair of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming . \nIn a sign of the Obama administration 's mounting anger and frustration , senior U.S. official have demanded BP share more data on the spill with them , accusing the company of falling short in keeping the government and public informed . \nThere were signs of growing tension between BP officials and the U.S. government at the briefing in Robert . \nAs Suttles described the `` massive amount of information being gathered through this exercise , '' Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry interrupted . \n`` I have to challenge the word ` exercise , ' Doug , '' Landry said . \n`` This is a full response . '' \nBP said it was working with a newly created Flow Rate Technical Team to determine the exact amount of oil escaping . \nSuttles said BP had spent almost $ 700 million on the spill response and had `` thrown absolutely everything '' at the job . \nBP also is drilling a relief well to try to plug the leak but it probably would not be finished until August . \nOn the Louisiana coast , fishermen counted the cost to their livelihoods . \n`` This is going to keep killing stuff and it will make whole areas incapable of supporting marine life , '' said George Barisich , president of the United Commercial Fishermen 's Association . \nBP has promised to pay legitimate damages claims and faces billions of dollars in expected cleanup and damages costs . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nYou stop driving we will stop drilling . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "430", "time": "2010-06-06", "text": "BP said its latest effort had captured 10,500 barrels of oil -LRB- 439,950 gallons\\/1 .67 million liters -RRB- in 24 hours and a second containment system should enable it to soon control the vast majority of oil spewing from the leak about 1 mile below the water 's surface . \nThe progress came as the company 's Chief Executive Tony Hayward said he has no plans to quit over his handling of the environmental disaster marked by a string of failures since the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the oil spill . \nThad Allen , the Coast Guard admiral heading up the federal relief effort , estimated the maximum collection from the containment device at about 15,000 barrels a day . \nEstimates put the well 's leak at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day . \nDespite the progress , Allen told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' program : `` This will only end when we intercept the wellbore , pump mud down it to overcome the pressure of the oil coming up from the reservoir and put a cement plug in ... '' `` This will be well into the fall , '' he said . \n`` This is a siege across the entire Gulf . \nThis spill is holding everybody hostage , not only economically but physically , and it has to be attacked on all fronts . '' \nFor many in Florida , the man-made environmental disaster is just the latest in a series of disastrous events to befall panhandle residents , from hurricanes to the housing bust . '' \n-LRB- Hurricane -RRB- Ivan took my roof off , the housing market took my business and my house and now this is hampering my comeback , '' said Bill Paul , who has scrapped plans to open a restaurant and was protesting at a BP station in Pensacola . \nPressure has mounted on London-based BP to stop the leak from the ruined seabed well and bear the cost of the cleanup and damage caused to coastal fisheries , wildlife and tourism . \nHayward became a lightning rod for Americans ' anger with BP when he told struggling Gulf Coast residents last month , `` I would like my life back , '' a remark widely seen as insensitive . \n`` It has n't crossed my mind , '' Hayward when asked by The Sunday Telegraph if he might resign because of the spill . \n`` It 's clearly crossed other people 's minds but not mine . '' \nHayward told the BBC he had the full support of BP 's board and the company 's balance sheet was strong , despite the plunge in the company 's market value as a result of the disaster . \n`` BP is ... generating a lot of cash . \nIt will generate $ 30 to $ 35 billion of free cash flow this year ... We have the financial strength to see through this , '' he told the BBC . \n`` We have a further containment system to implement in the course of this coming week which will be in place by next weekend , '' Hayward told the BBC . \n`` When these two are in place we ... hope to be containing the vast majority of the oil . '' \nThe Obama administration has delayed plans to increase offshore drilling as a result of the spill . \nThe crisis has put President Barack Obama on the defensive and distracted his team from their domestic agenda -- a new energy policy , reform of Wall Street and bolstering a struggling American economy . \nThe focus on America 's biggest environmental disaster comes ahead of November 's congressional elections in which the Democrats are expected to struggle to keep their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate . \nObama wants to tap into public anger over images of polluted beaches and fishing grounds to press for faster development of alternative energy such as solar and wind power , which was already on his agenda . \nOn Sunday , Senator John Kerry said lawmakers and Obama should now push that policy forward . \n`` I am convinced you 're going to see the Congress of the United States and the -LRB- Obama -RRB- administration together hold BP ... accountable , '' Kerry , a Democrat , told ABC 's `` This Week . '' \nKerry said America needs Congress to agree to a comprehensive energy policy that would cut pollution , be better for national security and create millions of jobs . \n`` Here 's what 's important -- not to be throwing the blame around , but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil , '' Kerry said . \nIn a speech last week at Carnegie Mellon University , Obama said the spill showed the United States can not continue to depend so heavily on fossil fuels . \nHe said offshore drilling was only a short-term solution to America 's energy needs . \nBut Senator John Cornyn said Republicans oppose a broad energy bill . \n`` Rather than try to hit a grand slam home run , I 'd like to work with Senator Kerry and others to hit some singles and develop nuclear power , battery technology that will help us deal with our environmental concerns , '' he said on ABC . \nOil began leaking from the well after the rig explosion that killed 11 workers . \nBP faces a criminal investigation , lawsuits , dwindling investor confidence and questions about its credit-worthiness . \nIts shares have lost about one-third of their value since the crisis began . \nBP said it has spent $ 1 billion on the spill and vowed to pay all legitimate claims of those harmed by the disaster . \nAfter contaminating wetland wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama , the black tide of crude oil has taken aim at some of the famous white beaches of Florida , whose economy is heavily dependent on tourism . \nFlorida Governor Charlie Crist told CNN the oil debris washing up on Panhandle beaches was relatively easy to clean up because it was landing on the famous sugar-white beaches instead of in marshes or estuaries , as in Louisiana . \nRon Gillette , a Pensacola medical supplies salesman , has been surfing in recent days and said that while little oil was in evidence in the water , `` We can smell it . \nIt stinks bad . '' \nTourism is Florida 's largest industry , employing nearly 1 million people . \nAnd some businesses are already suffering . \n`` It 's already affected our business , '' said Yancy Spencer , owner of the Innerlight Surf Shop in Gulf Breeze , the neighboring town to Pensacola Beach . \n`` We own rental places too and we 've had people canceling their week here . '' \nFully one-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,603 square miles -LRB- 202,582 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals , including sea turtles and dolphins , is climbing . \nIn Louisiana 's Four Bayou Pass , which separates Barataria Pass from the Gulf of Mexico , wildlife rescue workers hired by BP were dressed in white protective suits as they searched by boat from island to island for oiled birds . \nThe absorbent boom around one mangrove island , teeming with pelicans with nests and chicks , was covered in crude , stained orange and dark brown . \nOiled birds were visible behind the soiled boom . \nConcerned about the damage to tourism , Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that his state 's beaches have only a few tar balls . \n`` The coast is clear , come on down , '' he said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAnyone who 's been keeping an eye on the live feeds can tell you that . \nI feel it is our responsibility to take the steps necessary to start controlling this oil spill and just send BP the bill . \nWere the United States of America ! \nNo one tells us on our soil what to do ! \nNo foreign oil company will dictate to our media or to us anything . \nSomeone please wake up our Pres ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "786", "time": "2010-05-17", "text": "COCODRIE , Louisiana | Mon May 17 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT COCODRIE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP said on Monday it had `` turned the corner '' in a weeks-long effort to contain an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico even as the company faced fresh questions about its industry safety record . \nLondon-based BP Plc said its latest `` quick fix '' -- a mile-long siphon tube deployed by undersea robots down to the leaking well -- was capturing about a fifth of the oil leaking from the ruptured well . \nOfficials cautioned that the tube is helping contain the oil but will not stop the flow . \nThe company 's stock rose more than 2 percent in London on the news but later shed its gains . \nMore efforts to stem the spill were under way and there is another smaller leak besides the one now being targeted . \n`` I do feel that we have , for the first time , turned the corner in this challenge , '' BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said in Florida after meeting with Governor Charlie Crist . \n`` Over the last 48 hours , we 're beginning to meet with some significant success , '' Hayward said . \nBP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company hoped the pipe could help contain half of the oil escaping from the well . \n`` We 're getting a little over a thousand barrels of oil a day up through that tube and over the course of today we 'll be trying to increase that rate . '' \nBP executives have faced tough questions from the U.S. government over the huge spill threatening economic and environmental calamity to the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nThe disaster has hurt BP 's image , already tarnished in the United States from a 2006 spill in Alaska from a BP-owned pipeline and 2005 fire at the company 's Texas City refinery that killed 15 workers and injured 180 . \nA study released by the Center for Public Integrity showed two BP-owned U.S. refineries accounted for 97 percent of all flagrant safety violations found in the refining industry by government inspectors over the past three years . \n`` The only thing you can conclude is that BP has a serious , systemic safety problem in their company , '' Jordan Barab , deputy assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health , was quoted as saying in a statement from the nonprofit group . \nU.S. lawmakers are studying raising a cap on corporate liability for oil spills , but . \nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has rejected a proposed cap of $ 10 billion for oil companies to cover damages from oil spills as `` inadequate . '' \nThe spill threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster . \nWhile the U.S. Gulf Coast has so far been spared a massive landfall of heavy oil , small amounts in the form of surface sheen and tar balls , have come ashore in outlying parts of the coastline of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . \n`` People are freaking out . \nThey see the news and think oil is everywhere , but it is not , '' said Michael Dorie , co-owner of Wild Native and Five Rivers Delta Safaris , which takes people on eco-tours of Alabama 's Mobile Tensaw Delta . \n`` If it all dries up and disappears , well the highlight of my tours is wildlife and pretty flowers . \nTake that away and my tour becomes just a boat ride . \nIf people see oil slicked birds , how many more will not come ? '' \nShrimpers in southeastern Louisiana remained bleak despite news of BP 's progress . \n`` They 're a big company . \nThey 'll probably change their name and start over , '' said Drake Dupre , 48 , a shrimp boat captain . \n`` We 've got one life . \nWe ca n't start over again . \nWe 're not rich . '' \nDetailing the undersea efforts , BP 's Suttles said a suction tube had been inserted into a well riser pipe that fell to the ocean floor after last month 's explosion and sinking of a rig drilling the BP-owned well . \nThe riser pipe has been gushing oil from the blown-out well . \nThe inserted suction tube was siphoning off 1,000 barrels per day , about one fifth of the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- BP estimated to be leaking per day . \nOther estimates are much higher . \nBP said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would take time to try to increase the amount of oil and gas being siphoned off to a surface ship . \n`` This remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remains uncertain . \nOther containment options continue to be progressed , '' it added . \nBP 's next move , which it hopes will stop the flow completely , would involve a so-called `` top kill '' option in which engineers using the undersea robots would try to shoot heavy `` mud , '' a mixture of synthetic materials , into the well to form a barrier to prevent oil and gas from escaping . \nThis may be combined with a `` junk shot '' to inject material like golf balls and pieces of rubber tire , into the ruptured well 's failed `` blowout preventer '' to seal off oil flow . \n`` LOOP CURRENT '' COULD CARRY OIL Investors have already knocked around $ 30 billion off BP 's value over the spill , which followed the April 20 explosion in which eleven workers were killed . \nSurvivors ' accounts to media raised questions about whether safety controls were observed . \nIn comments to U.S. media over the weekend , scientists said they had found huge underwater `` plumes of oil '' several miles long in the Gulf of Mexico , suggesting much wider impact on the marine habitat than previously thought . \nBut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on those reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached about the discovery of `` undersea layers . '' \n`` The hypothesis that the layers consist of oil remains to be verified , '' it said . \nThere are fears that as the oil slick , which is broken into segments , spreads through the action of winds and current , it could run into the so-called `` Loop Current '' that could take it down to the Florida Keys and even up the U.S. East Coast . \nNOAA said that with light winds forecast from the south and the west in coming days , `` ocean models indicate that any tar balls leading the southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the south west and potentially into the Loop Current . '' \n`` The worst case would be if a hurricane comes through , that is my biggest fear , '' Alabama boat captain Dorie said . \nBut U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry told reporters the oil had not entered the `` Loop Current '' yet . \nThe U.S. Senate 's Homeland Security Committee began a hearing on the oil spill on Monday . \nBP had been under intense scrutiny by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration since the refinery explosion in 2005 , according to the Center for Public Integrity study . \nRefinery inspection data obtained by the center for OSHA 's nationwide program and the parallel Texas City inspection show BP received 862 citations between 2007 and 2010 for alleged violations at its refineries in Texas City and Toledo , Ohio . \nVirtually all were for alleged violations of OSHA 's process safety management standard , rules governing everything from storage of flammable liquids to emergency shutdown systems . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIt 's good to see some progress on the leak ; however , these massive plumes of oil floating in deep water in the Gulf , according to scientists and your report , are n't going away and they are very likely to resurface at some point . \nIt seems like there 's an `` out of sight , out of mind '' attitude about the biggest part of this spill ... It would be helpful to know what BP plans to do to siphon up that spilled oil from the deep before it can cause unrecoverable ecological damage . \nI 'm talking about the reported 10 mile long , 3 mile wide types of oil plumes floating in 3,300 feet of water -LRB- and apparently more of them than this big one -RRB- . \nWhat 's planned or being done to locate and pump that stuff out of the Gulf of Mexico ? \nIf BP wo n't do it , who will ? \nFrom what I 've read , this particular huge oil plume is around 100 miles from the Gulf 's `` loop current '' , which could pull that plume out of the Gulf toward Florida , the Caribbean and perhaps even the Atlantic ocean . \nI am concerned that nobody seems concerned about recovering this deep oil , which is apparently the bulk of the spill , and instead seem to be `` writing it off '' . \nIt 's surprising there 's no discussion about what 's going to be done about it and when . \nOnce that oil hits that loop current , it may be too late , so time 's a wastin ... This story seems to clarify why BP is n't discussing a plan to recover the oil plumes that scientists have discovered in the deep -- they do n't want to admit these plumes exist ! \nDo they believe `` microbes '' are going to do this part of the cleanup ? \nIt 's time to stop just trying to pretend the plume dosnt exist . \nIt really scares me that it will soon hit the gulf stream and dispurse all over thge world eventually . \nOf course it exists it explaines where the oil is going . \nIt has been pouring oil out nonstop since April 20 . \nAnd it explains how the massive discrepancy in the volume of the oil leak and spill size is going unnoticed for now , while the sea shore impacts thus far have been less than expected . \nIt 's fairly clear that this well needs to be plugged up and BP 's drilling lease permit revoked , at least until ALL of the cleanup and liabilities have been resolved . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "2128", "time": "2010-06-30", "text": "NEW YORK | Wed Jun 30 , 2010 9:48 am EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - From a legal perspective , BP 's Deepwater Horizon blowout and the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez are in many respects night and day . \n`` The Gulf is seen to be a systemic breakdown , '' said Zygmunt Plater , a professor at Boston College Law School and former chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission 's legal task force after the Valdez disaster . \n`` It 's not just one guy who had some drinks . '' \nThat was a reference to Joseph Hazelwood , the Valdez captain who admitted to drinking vodka before the spill . \nHe was convicted of negligent discharge of oil , a misdemeanor , and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service . \nThe closest analogs in the United States may be the litigation over asbestos , which analysts have estimated has cost between $ 250 billion and $ 300 billion , and tobacco , whose bill is hard to determine given the many pending cases . \nBut the Valdez disaster , which caused roughly 257,000 barrels , or 10.8 million gallons , to spill off the Alaska coast , does offer a glimpse into what analysts widely expect to be a grueling and extremely costly legal marathon for BP . \nLitigation dragged on for two decades as Exxon Mobil Corp fought over punitive damages , saying the $ 5 billion that an Alaska jury awarded in 1994 was excessive . \nA federal appeals court later cut that to $ 2.5 billion , and in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court slashed it to $ 507.5 million . \nExxon 's costs for the Valdez are now estimated at roughly $ 4 billion . \nThis includes more than $ 2 billion for cleanup , a $ 900 million civil penalty , a $ 125 million criminal penalty , and just over $ 1 billion for litigation with victims . \nBP will surely pay more -- a lot more . \n`` We 're looking at multibillion dollar criminal and civil penalties against BP , certainly record amounts under U.S. environmental laws , '' said David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan law professor and former chief of the U.S. Department of Justice 's environmental crimes section . \nBP may have helped itself by setting up a $ 20 billion escrow fund for victims , under pressure from a frustrated White House . \nThat is `` the kind of post-incident conduct that the government wants to see , '' and could result in lower penalties later , Uhlmann said . \nBut the legal road ahead remains arduous . \nAs with the Valdez , experts say litigation could take up to 20 years , with the cost and negative publicity potentially bringing one of Britain 's largest companies to its knees . \n`` This situation screams out for accountability , '' said Mary Wood , director of the environmental and natural resources law program at the University of Oregon . \n`` We ca n't put a price tag on the liability until the damage ceases . '' \nGuessing BP 's ultimate liability for the worst oil spill in U.S. history has become something of a parlor game on both sides of the Atlantic . \nThe company said on June 28 it had spent $ 2.65 billion so far on its response effort . \nWith the first of two relief wells not expected to be ready until August , that total is certain to soar . \nCleanup costs are likely to be only a small fraction of what the oil giant ends up paying . \nAnalysts at Credit Suisse have said BP 's cleanup and legal costs could reach $ 37 billion . \nGoldman Sachs & Co analysts projected $ 33 billion . \nRaymond James & Associates analysts , noting a `` more plaintiff-friendly '' U.S. legal system in environmental cases , projected $ 62.9 billion , after taxes . \nTopping them all is Plater who , noting the millions of people who live on or near the Gulf coast , said the total could even reach $ 90 billion . \nA BP spokesman , Mark Salt , said the company does not discuss litigation . \nBP has denied bankruptcy is an option . \nBP 's potential costs have several components : cleanup expenses , civil penalties that depend on the size of the spill , and litigation with investors , businesses and municipalities . \nCriminal penalties are also possible , after Attorney General Eric Holder said on June 1 the Justice Department had opened a criminal and civil probe into BP 's actions . \nAlready , lawsuits are pouring into courthouses almost as fast as tar balls are washing up onto beaches . \nMore than 250 have been filed so far , and many seek class-action status . \nAt least six have been filed on behalf of investors . \nSome allege violations of federal racketeering laws for scheming to conceal the danger of the drilling operations , and even for interfering with the claims process to delay or avoid payouts . \nThe majority are intended to help the fishermen , charter boat captains , shippers , restaurants , resort operators and others who say their livelihoods have been damaged . \nOne , filed by award-winning New Orleans chef Susan Spicer , is on behalf of restaurants that say customers are staying away because of rising seafood prices , contamination fears and lower convention and tourism activity . \n`` They were n't even prepared for an accident . \nSo now , they are totally making it up on the fly , '' said Scott Summy , a lawyer at Baron & Budd PC in Dallas who represents 18 fishermen and other plaintiffs against BP . \n`` These acts play very well under various state common law theories , such as negligence or gross negligence , as well as federal statutes . '' \nJeffrey Fisher , a Stanford Law School professor who represented fishermen and other Valdez spill victims before the U.S. Supreme Court in the Exxon case , said BP may try to limit the field of potential claimants . \n`` When you have a calamity like this that has so many secondary and tertiary effects , which seep into the economy and the well-being of local communities , the question is going to be where courts draw the line , '' he said . \n`` BP can argue it is only liable for hard economic losses , such as wages , '' Fisher went on . \n`` That will be a huge battleground . \nFor example , someone told me that beach communities are losing out on huge amounts of tourism revenue . \nIs BP on the hook for any of that ? \nWe do n't know . '' \nIn 2009 , BP generated more than $ 27 billion of operating cash flow , and it ended March with $ 105 billion of assets net of liabilities . \nThis suggests a large capacity to withstand evens tens of billions of dollars of spill costs . \nEven so , `` it 's hard for me to imagine anyone can suffer losses in the tens of billions of dollars and not notice it , '' said Roger Marzulla , a partner at Marzulla Law LLC in Washington and former head of the Justice Department environment and natural resources division . \nThe BP spill could run afoul of several federal laws . \nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 requires people seeking damages to contact the companies responsible for the spill to request compensation . \nOnce they do , civil lawsuits can follow . \nUnder the same act , responsible companies must also pay up to $ 1 billion for cleanup . \nIt also caps liability to victims at $ 75 million , though not if gross negligence , willful misconduct or certain safety violations are found . \nSome lawmakers want the cap retroactively increased to $ 10 billion , or even abolished . \nAnother law is the Clean Water Act , which allows liability of $ 1,100 per barrel spilled in waterways , but up to $ 4,300 per barrel if gross negligence is proven . \nIf the amount of oil spilled in the Gulf matches that of the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc offshore well operated by Mexico 's Pemex -- previously North America 's worst offshore spill -- liability under this act could reach $ 15 billion . \nOther laws are also at play . \nAmong them is the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851 , which the drill rig operator Transocean Ltd sought to invoke because it limits potential payouts by ship owners . \nAnother is the Refuse Act , which prohibits the dumping of refuse into waterways . \nMarzulla said BP could also face civil or criminal liability under three laws to protect wildlife . \nThese are : the Endangered Species Act ; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act covering roughly 836 species ; and the Marine Mammal Protection Act covering dolphins and whales . \nFines of $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 per violation are possible . \nUhlmann , meanwhile , said the Alternative Fines Act lets the government seek criminal penalties equal to twice the loss associated with the oil . \nWhile it is impossible to believe BP wanted the spill to happen , investigators could argue that the company took shortcuts that made it inevitable . \n`` Your company conducted its planning as if an uncontrolled subsea blowout was n't even a possibility , '' Florida Representative Nancy Castor told BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward at a June 17 Congressional hearing . \n`` Why were n't you prepared ? \nWhy did you elevate profits over safety ? '' \n`` I do n't believe we did elevate profits over safety , '' Hayward responded . \nBP 's recent U.S. safety record , however , is hardly pristine . \nLast year , it agreed to a $ 50 million criminal penalty for violating the Clean Water Act in connection with a 2005 Texas City refinery fire that killed 15 workers . \nIt has also pleaded guilty to a Clean Water Act violation over the 2006 release of roughly 212,000 gallons of oil in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay . \n`` One of the things the government is looking at in this tragedy is : Did BP and others shoot straight about conditions at the well site before the explosion occurred , and since the spill began ? '' \n`` If the government concludes that BP intentionally misled it about construction at the site or the amount of oil gushing , it could bring obstruction of justice and false statement charges . '' \nA criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act would cause BP to be shut out of government contracts for a period of time , a procedure known as debarment . \nThe company could also be barred from such contracts upon the entering of civil judgments over environmental law violations . \nBP has already faced partial bans on federal contracts because of past violations . \nFor example , the company was ineligible for federally-funded contracts for services from the Texas and Prudhoe Bay facilities . \nTalks over those bans were halted after the Deepwater Horizon explosion . \nPlater , the former chairman of the Alaska oil spill task force , said the 11 deaths caused by the BP explosion are likely to result in a finding of criminal liability . \nHe also noted that the size and location of the spill expose BP to far more costs than the Valdez did for Exxon . \nPlater said he would be `` very surprised '' if BP 's costs stopped at $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion , and that the sum `` could be two or three times that . '' \n`` This is not an attenuated 38,000 people on the coast of Alaska 4,000 miles away , '' he said . \n`` Harms are likely to be larger , with a population more than 100 times greater in the impact zone and much larger economies and coastal ecosystems . '' \nMichael Chalos , a partner at Chalos , O'Connor & Duffy LLP in Port Washington , New York who represented the Valdez captain Hazelwood , said criminal liability might turn on who at BP might have known of problems at the rig , and whether they had the capacity to fix them before the explosion . \n`` From a corporate standpoint , the lesson to be learned is what BP is doing , '' Chalos said . \n`` They have stepped up and acknowledged responsibility and are trying to do the right thing . \nBut every corporation has some limit to its ability to pay . \nHow much can BP afford before it ca n't afford any more ? '' \nOne variable may be how Kenneth Feinberg assesses and pays victims ' claims as the administrator of BP 's $ 20 billion fund . \nFeinberg has said claims can be filed over lost wages and profits , business interruption , personal injuries and death . \nHe also said it is essential to `` err on the side of the claimant '' in dispersing emergency funds , even if that results in the fund being depleted faster . \n`` You 've got to allow those payments to go out with less corroboration than you would if you 're giving a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation , '' Feinberg told CNN on June 21 . \n`` We 've got to ease the burden on these folks . '' \nFeinberg previously oversaw the disbursement of money to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . \nTo focus on BP , he will step down this summer as the U.S. Treasury Department 's `` pay czar '' for companies getting government help . \nLawyers said a critical issue for BP is whether claimants seeking more than emergency compensation will be required to sign releases absolving the company from further liability . \nThat could limit the scope of any litigation . \nBrian O'Neill , a partner at Faegre & Benson LLP in Minneapolis who won the $ 5 billion punitive damage award against Exxon , said Feinberg may have some tough calls to make . \nFor example , he said one might easily conclude an operator of a beachfront hotel where oil has washed ashore could make a valid claim . \nBut what of a beachfront hotel operator who has no oil damage , yet has suffered cancellations from customers worried that oil could come ashore ? \nOr perhaps a hotel operator two miles inland who has no oil damage but has lost customers ? \n`` How the administrator draws the lines as to who gets paid is the most interesting question right now , '' O'Neill said . \nChalos said getting a payout from the fund may be the best course for victims with smaller claims . \nReferring to Exxon victims , he said : `` A lot of the people who had claims are no longer around , sadly . \nIf you can get fairly compensated by working with BP , then you ought to go that route , if I were advising a claimant . '' \nBP could also limit its liability under the legal concept of `` contribution . '' \nEssentially a form of blame-shifting , this is where a responsible party like BP seeks to recover from other parties that may have had a hand in the disaster . \nIn his Congressional testimony , Hayward said the government had named four responsible parties : BP , Transocean , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co. . \nBP owns a 65 percent stake in the well , while Anadarko controls 25 percent and Mitsui 10 percent . \nAnadarko has a much smaller balance sheet than BP , and far less capacity to absorb big liabilities from the spill , which Chief Executive James Hackett said was `` preventable '' and resulted from BP 's `` reckless '' conduct . \n`` We will be looking at our contractual remedies , '' he said in an June 18 interview . \n`` We 're focusing on the fact that there appears to be gross negligence and willful misconduct . '' \nLawyers said BP might also seek to recover from two other defendants : Cameron International Corp , which provided a blowout preventer , and Halliburton Co , in charge of cementing the oil well to stabilize its walls . \n`` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations , '' Hayward said in a June 18 statement . \nContribution lawsuits may be BP 's best hope to cap costs . \n`` The real fight will be between BP , Anadarko , Mitsui , Transocean and Halliburton , '' Uhlmann said . \n`` Billions of dollars of liability are at stake , and the other companies are not going to want to help BP pay . '' \nBP may also try to insist that any government settlements not carry onerous `` reopener '' provisions that allow regulators to seek additional payments for latent problems . \nExxon 's $ 900 million settlement in 1991 with Alaska and the United States had a four-year `` reopener window '' letting the governments claim as much as an additional $ 100 million . \nA day before the window was to close on September 1 , 2006 , they demanded another $ 92 million . \nThey are still pursuing it . \nIn addition , BP may face battles over insurance . \nOn May 21 , for example , Lloyd 's of London asked a federal court in Houston to disallow a possible $ 700 million BP claim for coverage through a Transocean policy , saying the policy covers pollution originating only above land and water lines . \n`` Because liabilities BP faces for pollution emanating from BP 's well are from below the surface and from BP 's well , those liabilities are not within the scope of the additional insured protection , '' the complaint said . \nOne area where BP may not face enormous costs is punitive damages . \nFor that it can thank the Exxon litigation . \nThis is because the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in Exxon Shipping Co v. Baker that set punitive damages in the Valdez case at $ 507.5 million , equal to the amount of compensatory damages , set a standard that may limit recoveries from BP . \n`` A penalty should be reasonably predictable in its severity , '' Justice David Souter wrote for a 5-3 majority . \n-LRB- The Court 's ninth justice , Samuel Alito , recused himself because he owned Exxon stock . -RRB- \n`` Given the need to protect against the possibility -LRB- and the disruptive cost to the legal system -RRB- of awards that are unpredictable and unnecessary , either for deterrence or for measured retribution , '' Souter continued , `` we consider that a 1:1 ratio , which is above the median award , is a fair upper limit '' for punitive damages in maritime cases such as Exxon . \nIt is unclear where the Court might stand if it ever considers the BP spill . \nSouter retired last year . \nJustice John Paul Stevens , who dissented in Exxon , just completed his final term . \nAny litigation will likely take years to arrive . \nIn the interim , lower courts are expected to follow the Exxon ruling . \nAmong the early battles will be over where to hear much of the litigation . \nSome judges have recused themselves from various spill lawsuits , presumably because of stock ownership . \nBP wants lawsuits tried in Houston , closer to its offices and perhaps a friendlier environment . \nIt has even requested that a specific federal judge be assigned : Lynn Hughes , an appointee of President Ronald Reagan . \nAccording to the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary , which profiles judges based on unattributed comments from practicing lawyers , Hughes has `` very good legal ability , '' and also can be skeptical of claims by civil plaintiffs and the government . \n`` He hates plaintiffs and he hates the government , '' one plaintiff 's lawyer is quoted as saying . \n`` He is , by and large , a little on the defense side , '' said a civil defense lawyer , who then added : `` You can change his mind , but you have to have the ammunition . '' \nBP must also be careful to find juries capable of divorcing what they know and feel about the spill and can see on the news or web from the evidence presented to them . \n`` You can always get a jury , '' O'Neill said . \n`` They got one in Alaska . \nIt took four days . '' \nThe U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation is expected to meet on July 29 in Boise , Idaho to consider how best to combine many of the overlapping lawsuits . \nWherever it takes place , litigation will be protracted , as it has been in other areas where damages are often unknowable for years . \nAsbestos , for example , still generates litigation because while many companies had stopped using it for fireproofing and insulation by the mid-1970s , after-effects can take decades to surface . \nW.R. Grace & Co has spent nine years in bankruptcy court after asbestos prompted a Chapter 11 filing . \nDrug litigation also can take years . \nFor example , Wyeth , now owned by Pfizer Inc , ultimately set aside more than $ 21 billion in a decade of litigation over the diet drug fen-phen , which was linked to heart valve damage . \nAnd then there are cigarettes , where decades of litigation reached a peak in 2000 when a Florida jury ordered tobacco companies to pay $ 145 billion in punitive damages to sick smokers . \nWhile the Florida Supreme Court later threw out that ruling , thousands of cases remain in the courts . \n`` We have examples in tobacco , asbestos and pharmaceuticals where funds are set up by third-party trustees , '' said Marzulla , the former Justice Department official . \n`` But those address one set of injuries , '' he went on . \n`` Here , it is much more complicated . \nThere is no formula for how much fishermen , resort owners , beachfront property owners or others who make their livings in the bayou will be paid . '' \nLawyers and analysts said a criminal penalty for BP could top the record $ 1.3 billion that Pfizer agreed to pay last September , as part of a $ 2.3 billion payout over marketing of the pain medicine Bextra . \n`` Could BP eventually get overwhelmed and go belly up ? \nSure , it happened to a lot of companies with asbestos exposure , '' the energy investment boutique Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote this month . \n`` But only after losing a bunch of court battles . '' \n`` WE GO TO WAR OVER OIL '' O'Neill estimated that BP 's costs could reach $ 5 billion for cleanup , $ 4 billion for natural resources damages , and $ 10 billion in private lawsuits . \nShareholder lawsuits , on the other hand , are perhaps `` not worth very much , '' given what he called the government 's interest in keeping BP not only solvent but healthy . \n`` Oil is necessary to the country -- we go to war over oil -- so we do n't want to put a major oil transactor out of business , '' he said . \n`` The one thing that could screw it up for BP is if the administrator for the fund does n't pay out money quickly . \nIt will be a major disaster for both the -LRB- Obama -RRB- administration and BP , and keep this thing churning . '' \nWhat if , however , damages did reach the $ 90 billion that Plater suggested . \nCould BP handle that ? \n`` No , '' Plater said , `` but there could be contribution , and an attaching of assets . \nIt could also teach someone about government . \nMr. Reagan said the best government is the least government . \nIn this case , we need government , but we need good government to avoid the collusive partnership our commission determined had made the Exxon Valdez incident inevitable . '' \nThe administration of President Barack Obama may also want to ensure that any settlement with BP positions the government well in future litigation , according to Wood from the University of Oregon . \n`` When a private company harms a public resource , like the ocean or beach , they are liable , '' she said . \n`` Each fish , for example , gets a price tag . \nThe crux is that the government is a trustee of public property that has been damaged . \nIt has the absolute duty to make the people 's trust whole again , and get the last penny out of BP in the form of damages . '' \nWhat the government can not do is restore the Gulf of Mexico to its pre-April 20 state , just as it could not restore the Alaskan waters and roughly 1,300 miles of coastline to where they were before anyone knew Exxon had a vessel called Valdez . \n`` The lesson of both of these things , not so much from a legal level , is that we 're not able to respond to massive oil spills , '' Stanford Law 's Fisher said . \n`` The only solution is prevention . \nIt 's not response , and it 's not legal action .

'' \nA trip along Cuba 's coastline is like a trip back in time where vast stretches of palm-fringed beaches sit undeveloped and sea life abounds in the crystalline waters . \nWhile rampant development and overfishing have damaged coastlines and depleted seas around the world , communist-led Cuba has been largely preserved by its slow economic pace . \nAs a result , scientists and environmentalists view Cuban waters as a place where they can see how the world 's oceans were decades ago . \n`` Many areas along the coast , and thousands of small keys , are in rural areas or are remote and have simply been left alone , '' said Dan Whittle , senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund . \n`` Ernest Hemingway set up a fish camp on Cayo Paraiso -LRB- about 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- west of Havana -RRB- in the 1940s and the area has not really changed since then . \nIf he were still alive , he 'd still recognize it today , '' he said of the U.S. writer who lived in Cuba for two decades . \nCuba 's northwest coast is considered most in danger from the oil . \nIt is there that coral reefs , seagrass beds and mangroves provide major breeding grounds for many fish and sea creatures , including endangered migratory species like sea turtles , sharks and manatees , Whittle said . \nAll that is at stake if the BP oil finds its way to Cuba . \nIt could also damage Cuba 's tourism industry , which is centered on beaches and to a lesser degree eco-tourism . \nTourism brought in more than $ 2 billion to Cuba last year , or about 20 percent of Cuban 's foreign exchange income . \nThe good news for Cuba is that the spill is still centered about 300 miles -LRB- 483 km -RRB- northwest of the island and BP may finally be gaining control over the massive leak . \nOfficials for the oil giant said on Friday their so-called `` top kill '' solution of plugging the gusher by pumping in `` drilling mud '' was showing signs of success . \nBut even if that happens soon , Cuban officials are concerned that the oil already in the water could be swept south by gulf currents . \nCuba is separated from the Florida Keys by just 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- of water and despite their disparate political histories , the United States and Cuba are inextricably linked ecologically . \nAnother rumor that supposedly contributed to the Cuban beach closures this week was that lionfish , which have venomous spikes and have invaded Cuban waters in recent years from Florida , were poisoning swimmers . \nThe government said that rumor also was false . \nThe United States and Cuba have been at odds since Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution , but they held talks last week about the oil slick , officials said . \nCuba expert Wayne Smith at the Center for International Policy think tank in Washington said he met with Cuban authorities this week in Havana and that they are `` fully open '' to cooperation with the Americans to stop the oil . \nStanding in the way is the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba , which prevents the use of much U.S. technology in Cuba . \nAt a conference this week in Washington , oil experts and environmentalists said it was time to allow cooperation with Cuba in oil safety practices . \n`` We are not talking about a transfer of technology . \nAll we are asking is that , if there is an accident , the Cubans can pick up the phone and call American experts who can bring resources within 24 hours , '' said oil expert Jorge Pinon . \nThe issue is becoming a bigger one as Spanish oil giant Repsol -LRB- REP. MC -RRB- REP. N prepares to drill for oil off Cuba 's ecologically rich northwest coast perhaps later this year . \nIt has contracted for use of an Italian-owned drilling rig now being completed in China . \nWhile the spill is a disaster , it might have one positive result , Smith said . \n`` It actually could help improve -LRB- U.S.-Cuba -RRB- relations if we cooperate in the right way and we have the right attitude , '' he said . \n"}

{"id": "551", "time": "2010-05-28", "text": "Fri May 28 , 2010 8:06 pm EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Since the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the worst U.S. oil spill ever , the economic and environmental impact of the accident has widened . \nHere are some facts about the impact of the spill : Louisiana , the nearest state to BP 's gushing undersea well 42 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , has been the most affected by the spill so far . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said this week that more than 100 miles of Louisiana 's 400-mile coast had so far been affected by the spilled oil , including fragile marshlands and wildlife refuges . \nHe and other state and local officials have reported heavy sheets of oil soiling wetlands and seeping into marine and bird nurseries , leaving a thick stain of sticky crude on the Roseau cane that binds the marshes together . \nBilly Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , said he saw dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of the Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . \n`` Oil debris , '' in the form of tar balls and surface `` sheen , '' has also been reported coming ashore in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . \nIn the week of May 17 , Coast Guard officials found tar balls on some beaches in the Florida Keys , raising fears that a so-called Loop Current that runs from the Gulf of Mexico through the Florida Straits may have already brought oil from the spill far to the southeast . \nBut laboratory tests subsequently showed the tar balls were not from the BP oil spill , the Coast Guard said . \nThe U.S. government has declared a `` fishery disaster '' in the seafood-producing states of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama due to the oil spill . \nThis makes them eligible for federal funds to offset the current and future impact on fisherman and their communities of the oil pollution in their fishing grounds . \nLouisiana 's $ 2.4 billion seafood industry supplies up to 40 percent of U.S. seafood and employs over 27,000 people . \nThe state is the second-biggest U.S. seafood harvester , after Alaska , and the top provider of shrimp , oysters , crab and crawfish . \nNOAA on Friday extended the area closed to fishing in the Gulf as a result of the spill to 25 percent of Gulf U.S. federal waters , an area covering 60,683 square miles -LRB- 157,169 square km -RRB- , up from 20 percent previously . \nIt says it is taking this step as a precautionary measure to ensure seafood from the Gulf remains safe for consumers . \nNOAA points out that approximately 75 percent of Gulf federal waters are still available for fishing . \nBut the ban affects hundreds of thousands of commercial and recreational fishermen , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oystercatchers and charter boat operators . \nOil , some of it in thick sheets , but also in the form of sheen and tar balls , has already come ashore in Louisiana wildlife reserves like the Breton National Wildlife Refuge on the offshore Breton and Chandeleur Islands , and the Pass-a-Loutre refuge farther to the south . \nWildlife officials have reported more than 300 sea birds , nearly 200 turtles and 19 dolphins have been found dead along the Gulf Coast during the first five weeks after spill . \nBut they stress that only a relatively low number of these had signs of external oiling , so they may not all be related to the spill . \nThe 316 dead birds collected along the shores of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -- plus 10 others that died or were euthanized at wildlife rehabilitation centers after they were captured alive -- far outnumber the 31 surviving birds found oiled over that period . \nJournalists and scientists have also reported seeing at least one shark , and other creatures like eels and turtles , swimming through surface oil . \nWildlife officials say they expect more marine creatures , birds and mammals will be affected as more of the oil comes ashore . \nTourism operators in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- from hotel owners to restaurateurs and boat charterers -- have reported cancellations as a result of the spill , although some are picking up other business from journalists , officials and cleanup workers who have flocked to the Gulf Coast . \nAmidst a scare involving tar balls found on Florida Keys beaches -- later declared not to have come from the BP oil spill -- Florida 's $ 60-billion-a-year tourism industry is also losing millions as a result of the incident , a top state tourism marketing official said earlier this month . \nOf all the threatened states , Florida has the most to lose . \nTourism is its economic lifeblood , its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors a year , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million Floridians . \nOfficials say even the threat of pollution that could come from the spill is enough to make a significant `` dent '' in the tourism industries of Florida and other Gulf states . \nMajor shipping channels and ports on the U.S. Gulf Coast remain open , although some industry sources have reported possible delays caused by the oil slick . \nNOAA said on Friday it had begun work to survey a new ship anchorage site at the mouth of the Mississippi River for ships to undergo inspection and oil decontamination before entering ports . \nU.S. authorities are anxious to keep Gulf shipping operating to maintain vital U.S. exports and imports . \nNOAA says Lower Mississippi River ports export over 50 million metric tons of corn , soybeans and wheat each year , more than 55 percent of all U.S. grains inspected for shipment . \n-LRB- Reporting by Matthew Bigg ,

Navy\\/Handout ROBERT , Louisiana | Mon May 10 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said on Monday it will again attempt to contain oil gushing deep in the Gulf of Mexico , this time with a far smaller funnel than it tried before , as a massive slick threatened Louisiana shores . \nWith cleanup efforts in high gear , a blame game will unfold in Washington on Tuesday as executives from BP and two other companies involved , Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co , appear before Senate panels probing the disaster . \nBP now aims to deploy a small `` top hat '' dome over the leak after its effort over the weekend to cover it with a huge metal box was stymied by a buildup of crystallized gas hydrates . \nFears of a prolonged environmental and economic disaster for the Gulf Coast are growing after the setback for BP , which contracted the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded on April 20 , killing 11 people and triggering the spill . \nDelays in containing the leaking well increase the chances it could become the worst U.S. oil spill , surpassing the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Prince William Sound , Alaska . \nThe new plan is to have an oil-barrel-sized container at the leak site , a mile down from the water 's surface , within 72 hours , BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said . \nThen oil would be siphoned up to a tanker . \n`` There will be less seawater in the smaller dome and therefore less likelihood of hydrate formation , '' he told reporters at the company 's U.S. headquarters in Houston . \nHydrates , essentially slushy methane gas , clogged the top of the dome , preventing crude from being pumped . \nThe projected westward spread of the massive slick it is creating has raised fears for rich fishery areas filled with shrimps , oysters , crabs and crayfish , and even on major shipping channels off the Louisiana coast . \nThe company is also spraying chemical dispersants at the ruptured well , an operation Hayward said was showing some success . \nThe well is spewing an estimated 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day into the Gulf . \nIt threatens tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds across four states and has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling . \nOther options BP is weighing to stem the flow of oil include trying to block the well 's failed blowout preventer with a `` junk shot '' of rubber or other materials , or fitting a new valve or preventer . \nIt is also drilling a relief well , but that could still take 75 to 80 days to complete . \nIn written testimony for Tuesday 's Senate hearings , a BP executive directs blame for the blowout at Transocean , the rig 's owner and overseer of the operation of the blowout preventer , a stack of pipes and valves designed to close off the flow of oil in case of a sudden pressure change . \nTransocean says the blowout preventer was not the cause , and instead points to failure of two other vital elements -- the well 's metal casing and the cement that entombed it . \nHalliburton , which had the cementing contract , had finished cementing the final casing in place 20 hours before the explosion , according to testimony . \nBP has incurred $ 350 million in costs so far from response , containment , relief well drilling and payments to Gulf Coast states , suggesting the final bill could be much higher than many analysts predicted . \nHayward said an investigation into the incident will reveal what happened in the moments before the well blew out . \nIt will likely also generate new measures to control blowouts . \nHe rejected the notion that BP , one of the world 's largest oil companies , was ill-prepared to deal with such an incident . \n`` Frankly , it 's been far more effective than any spill response hitherto in terms of containment offshore and preventing oil from getting to the shore , '' he said . \nBP shares fell 0.9 percent at 1430 GMT , lagging a 4.8 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index . \nThe stock dropped as low as 540.7 p in London , its lowest level since November . \nBP 's American Depositary Receipts fell 0.5 percent in New York . \nThe stock has fallen by around 15 percent since the rig blast , wiping around $ 30 billion from BP 's market value . \nThe Louisiana Offshore Oil Port -LRB- LOOP -RRB- , the nation 's only deepwater oil terminal located southwest of New Orleans , said vessel movements were unaffected so far . \nThe slick 's major contact with the shoreline so far has been in the unpopulated Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , which is a mostly a wildlife reserve and bird sanctuary . \nAt Breton Island in the Chandeleurs , crude is washing into a bird colony , said John Andrew , regional wildlife refuge chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . \n`` I am expecting it to get bad , '' he said . \n`` The birds are foraging into the water , into the sheen . \nThey plunge for fish . \nSheen is getting into their feathers and we are concerned about what happens when they return to the nest . '' \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said winds could push oil ashore in the Mississippi Delta , Breton Sound , the Chandeleur Islands and areas directly north . \nIf the wind keeps blowing from the southeast , oil could reach as far west as Atchafalaya Bay by late on Wednesday , NOAA said . \nThe two Louisiana parishes directly west of the Mississippi Delta declared states of emergency on Sunday . \nNational Guard helicopters in Louisiana 's Lafourche Parish dropped sandbags onto outlying island beaches to try to block oil from getting into fragile marshlands . \nTar balls washed up on Alabama 's Dauphin Island , a barrier island and popular beach resort , during the weekend and local tourism operators said vacation traffic had already slowed to a trickle because of fears of the spill 's impact . \n`` It makes me so sad . \nYou take so many things for granted : a beautiful beach , fresh shrimp whenever you want it . \nIt is so frustrating because there seems to be no answers for it , '' said Dauphin Island resident Joyce Carroll . \nFishing is suspended in parts of the Gulf waters and much of the Louisiana coast . \nMany tourists have been scared away by reports of reddish , putrid water offshore , even though the coast is currently unaffected . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n2 Chronicles 7:14 God 's Word is very much relevant today , you know ! \nThe government needs to step in and get some of the best scientific minds in the world working on this ...

oil from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well while U.S. scientists tried to figure out just how much crude was still pouring out . \nThe London-based company 's share price closed down 5 percent in London after U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to know `` whose ass to kick '' over the massive spill . \nThe on-going disaster remains at the top of Obama 's crowded domestic agenda , a point underscored by his strong comments and Tuesday 's announcement that he will head back to the Gulf coast next week to inspect efforts to contain the spill . \nObama will visit Mississippi , Alabama and Florida during a two-day trip beginning on Monday , the White House said . \nBP already faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits over the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and triggered the 50-day-old oil spill , the worst in U.S. history . \nEfforts to contain the mess forged ahead . \nBP said on Tuesday it had collected 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking well on Monday , 33 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday and the highest capture rate since it installed a new system last week to contain the spill . \nBP later said it collected 7,850 barrels of oil in the 12-hour stretch ended at noon CDT -LRB- 1700 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday . \nThat brought the total collected since the cap was installed to 51,364 barrels . \nHoping to calm rising passions , BP said it would donate revenues from the oil it is recovering to restore Gulf wildlife habitats . \nThe company had already committed itself to cleaning up after the disaster . \nThe political heat remains intense as the disaster spills over into energy policy in Washington . \nThe Interior Department issued new safety and environmental requirements for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . \nThey have until June 28 to show they have met the new requirements or face being shut down . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward was called to testify , for the first time , at a congressional hearing on June 17 that will focus on the company 's role in the rig explosion and subsequent spill . \nBP said he would attend . \nAnother congressional committee investigating the spill sent a letter to rig operator Transocean that questioned whether the company had enough people working on Deepwater Horizon at the time of the explosion . \nAfter the spill , the Obama administration imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . \nU.S. officials also refused to approve new drilling in shallow waters until new rules were issued . \nCoast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort , said on Monday neither BP nor the government knew just how much oil was gushing out of the well . \n`` That 's the big unknown right now , '' he said . \nBP has given conservative estimates of the oil flow that have been ridiculed by scientists and U.S. lawmakers . \nEven the government 's much higher estimates of 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day seemed on the low side after Allen said the company planned to double its collection of oil from the well to 20,000 barrels every day -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- . \nAllen said on Tuesday U.S. scientists would present revised estimates later this week or early next week . \nThe panel of experts has said BP 's latest effort to contain the oil spill could actually increase the flow rate by up to 20 percent . \nBP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . \nObama , who faces growing criticism that he has appeared detached from the economic and ecological catastrophe hitting four U.S. Gulf states , sharpened his criticism of BP in an interview with NBC 's `` Today '' show that aired on Tuesday . \nObama said he was talking to experts to find out what had gone wrong `` so I know whose ass to kick '' over the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline and threatens the Gulf Coast 's lucrative fishing industry . \nFadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer and Co , said it was `` not a coincidence '' that BP 's shares were down after Obama 's comments increased pressure on the company to fix the mess . \nIn New York , BP 's American depositary shares fell more than 5 percent , mirroring the losses in earlier London trading . \nTransocean shares also tumbled in New York , trading to their lowest in 18 months , as the market worried about the company 's liability for the oil disaster . \nBP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted . \nInvestors are worried about the size of the final bill for the spill , expected to be in the billions . \nThe company has already spent more than $ 1 billion on cleaning up the slick , which has fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \nU.S. weather forecasters gave their first confirmation on Tuesday that some of the oil leaking from BP 's well has lingered beneath the surface rather than rising to the top . \nUndersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels and shrimp . \nIn Fort Jackson in southern Louisiana , the New Orleans Saints , winners of the National Football League 's Superbowl in February , held a rally to help lift the spirits of communities reeling from the spill . \n`` I came out to support the Saints and to try and get my mind off the oil spill . \nThis team has meant everything to the state of Louisiana , '' said local homemaker Laura Bartholomew . \nHundreds of fans , many wearing black and gold jerseys , braved scorching temperatures to attend the rally . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe ca n't expect anything else from them other than trying to maximize

White House is being deluged with emails urging him to show something , he 's coming out acting tough . \nToo little too late , my man . \nYou have lost our trust and will need to earn it back . \nPass comprehensive campaign reform . \nWe vote for them and then they listen to the lobbyists and not us . \nStop playing politics and start leading . \nOr else the Republicans will be back in power

'' \n`` And I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar ; we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers , so I know whose ass to kick , '' he added . \nIn London , BP 's share price was down more than 2 percent after Obama 's remarks . \nBP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted , and the company suffered another blow when Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on BP to `` neutral '' from `` buy '' this week . \nThe stakes are high for Obama too . \nA Washington Post\\/ABC poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the government had done a `` not so good '' or `` poor '' job handling the spill . \nJust over 1,000 people were surveyed in the poll , conducted between June 3 and 6 . \nThe spill has affected 120 miles of coastline , fouling wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sending tar balls ashore on northwest beaches of Florida , where the $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry accounts for nearly 1 million jobs . \nThe Obama administration has imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . \nBut the U.S. Interior Department may issue new safety and environmental requirements as soon as Tuesday for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . \nThe Gulf of Mexico incident has also started to have international ramifications . \nBritain said it would increase its inspection of North Sea drilling rigs and monitoring of offshore practices in light of the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nThe International Energy Agency said it may cut its oil output estimates for the Gulf of Mexico by up to 300,000 barrels a day for 2015 on potentially tighter U.S. laws on deepwater drilling after the BP well accident . \nWhile a complete halt to the flow of oil is not expected until August at the earliest , BP has reported an increase in the amount of oil it is capturing from the well in its latest containment effort . \nCoast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who leads the government 's relief effort , said on Monday that London-based BP hoped to collect 20,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- per day in its latest effort . \nBP said it had collected 7,541 barrels of oil in the first 12 hours of Monday . \nIf it collected the same amount the rest of the day , the total for Monday would be more than 15,000 barrels , about 35 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday . \nNeither Allen nor BP gave an estimate of how much oil is still flowing into the Gulf . \nBP 's latest attempt involves placing a containment cap on top of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor . \nAway from the action in the Gulf , the political heat remains intense in Washington with yet another congressional hearing set to bring BP and its peers under renewed scrutiny . \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing at 10:00 EDT -LRB- 1400 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday titled : `` The Risky Business of Big Oil : Have Recent Court Decisions and Liability Caps Encouraged Irresponsible Corporate Behavior ? '' \nDemocrats in Congress have been looking at lifting such caps . \nCALLS FOR PUNISHMENT OF COMPANIES The Senate hearing follows one in Chalmette , Louisiana , where two women who lost their husbands in the explosion that unleashed the crisis urged members of Congress to hold BP accountable . \n`` I am asking you to please consider harsh punishments on companies who choose to ignore safety standards before other families are destroyed , '' said Courtney Kemp , whose husband , Wyatt , was killed in the explosion . \nThe gravity of the spill was spelled out by Admiral Allen , who said its environmental consequences could last for years . \n`` Dealing with the oil spill on the surface is going to go on for a couple of months '' once the well is plugged , he said . \n`` Long-term issues of restoring the environment and the habitats ... will be years . '' \nImages of birds struggling through oil-soaked waters ringing Louisiana 's ecologically fragile barrier islands and marshes have added to the public outcry and pressure on Obama . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

We are suing them for the amount it will take to make Alabama whole , '' King told Reuters , declining to specify a figure for damages . \nBP had no immediate comment , a company spokeswoman said . \nThe suit also named Anadarko Petroleum Corp , among others . \nTransocean owned the doomed Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that was hired by BP and exploded and sank in April , triggering the oil spill . \nHalliburton provided the cement work for the well while Anadarko was a minority owner . \n`` It is believed the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon was a blowout relating to the cementing work , '' the suit said . \nAlabama 's state government is divided over the lawsuit . \nGovernor Bob Riley said in a statement he opposed the decision on the grounds that it was premature to sue BP before it has a chance to pay claims , especially given that the company has admitted it is responsible . \nKing argued the suit put Alabama in the strongest legal position and said that , while an out of court settlement was possible , the next step was discovery and gathering evidence . \nThe suit accuses BP and the other defendants of `` negligent or wanton failure to adhere to recognized industry standards of care . '' \n`` The defendants ' conduct in operating the Deepwater Horizon and oil well illustrates their scheme to maximize profits and ignore dangerous risks posed to human health and property , '' it said . \nLouisiana sustained the most damage to its coastline and waters from the oil spill , which began in April and was plugged with cement on July 15 . \nOil also damaged the economies of Mississippi and Florida . \nThe spill has hurt industries including fishing and tourism and has affected other sectors such as housing . \nPeople and businesses that have sustained losses can claim against a $ 20 billion BP compensation fund administered by Kenneth Feinberg , named by the White House as an independent overseer . \nBut Feinberg was undermining efforts by Gulf state attorneys general to make it possible for spill victims to claim damages from the fund while retaining the right to sue BP at a future date , King said . \nAt the same time , he said , BP was seeking to evade its responsibility despite a high-profile advertising campaign which states `` we will make this right '' and promises to honor all legitimate claims . \nMississippi Governor Haley Barbour in July asked his state 's attorney general not to file a suit against BP to give the federal claims process a chance to work and to allow for a complete assessment of damage to natural resources . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "424", "time": "2011-01-04", "text": "LONDON | Tue Jan 4 , 2011 8:57 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Shares in oil major BP hit a six-month high on Tuesday after reports rival Royal Dutch Shell considered a takeover bid , and that economic damages from its oil spill will be lower than forecast . \nBP shares were up 5.6 percent to 491.7 pence by 1351 GMT -LRB- 8:51 EST -RRB- . \nThe Daily Mail newspaper , citing sources close to the Anglo-Dutch group , reported Shell weighed an opportunistic bid for BP as crude gushed into the Gulf last summer , but was discouraged by the potentially uncapped legal liabilities . \nThe newspaper said Shell could yet bid for BP if another suitor emerged but Europe 's largest oil company by market value was unlikely to be the `` first mover '' for number two , BP . \nDealers and analysts including Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at ETX Capital , said BP was also being boosted by comments late on December 31 from the lawyer running BP 's gulf oil spill compensation fund that suggested damages payments could be half the expected level . \nKen Feinberg , the independent administrator of the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP told Bloomberg Television about half the fund 's assets should be adequate to cover claims for economic losses . \nOne dealer said the news reports focused minds on the fact BP shares were cheap compared to rivals . \n`` BP remains cheap and vulnerable at these levels but I do not think a bid is likely . '' \nBP shares trade on a price-earnings ratio of 6.5 times , consensus 2011 earnings , while Shell trades at 8.9 times , partly reflecting the fact BP 's actual earnings could be far lower if it was found to have been grossly negligent in causing the oil spill which would boost legal costs and fines . \nHowever , Feinberg 's comment highlighted how the picture could also be brighter than the company has predicted . \nThe reports come ahead of a final report , to be released January 11 , by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill , which was convened by President Barack Obama to uncover what led to the U.S. 's worst ever oil spill . \nComments by Commission members and documents previously released by the Commission suggest the report will be highly critical of BP , and could lead the way to multi-billion dollar federal fines . \nAnalysts and industry sources said during the crisis last summer it was likely that both U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil and Shell -- the only companies considered large enough to mount a bid -- would run some calculations on a possible bid for BP . \nHowever , the two notoriously conservative companies were seen as likely to be discouraged by the open-ended nature of BP 's liabilities . \nNow BP 's shares have rebounded 65 percent from their June low at 296 pence , to give BP a market value of around $ 140 billion , a bid would be much harder to mount , especially for Shell which is worth over $ 210 billion . \nExxon has a market value of almost $ 370 billion . \nIt is uncertain whether regulators on either side of the Atlantic would support a tie-up in the top tier of the industry . \nShell stock traded up 1.4 percent , against a 2.7 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index , which was lifted by crude prices which hovered near a 27-month high . \nBP and Shell declined comment . \n"}
{"id": "1912", "time": "2010-10-29", "text": "NEW YORK | Fri Oct 29 , 2010 3:20 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - New criticism of Halliburton Co 's work on BP Plc 's blown-out Gulf of Mexico well could make it harder for the world 's second-largest oilfield services company to escape significant responsibility for the disaster . \nLawyers for the government and spill victims gained ammunition after the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill said Halliburton knew of , but did not address , flaws in the cement used in the doomed well before the April 20 disaster . \nWhile Houston-based Halliburton might face less overall liability than BP and rig owner Transocean Ltd , its shares slid 8 percent on Thursday following the report 's release , wiping out $ 2.5 billion of market value . \n`` The report shines a harsher light on Halliburton 's role , '' said David Uhlmann , a University of Michigan Law School professor and former chief of the Justice Department 's environmental crimes section . \n`` Halliburton had a much smaller role than BP or Transocean , but is likely to face at the very least penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars , and possibly as much as $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion , '' he said . \n`` This is also good evidence for any plaintiffs pursuing civil lawsuits against Halliburton . '' \nHalliburton defended its actions Thursday , saying that `` significant differences between its internal cement tests and the Commission 's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested . '' \nBP had hired Halliburton to perform cementing operations to seal the well . \nHalliburton has argued that BP bears responsibility for having failed to test the integrity of the cement job . \nThe findings might nonetheless increase Halliburton 's relative share of the blame for the disaster , which killed 11 workers and is expected to result in tens of billions of dollars in federal penalties . \nBP has set up a $ 20 billion fund overseen by former Obama administration executive pay czar Kenneth Feinberg to pay victims including fishermen , restaurants and resort owners . \nSeveral hundred spill-related lawsuits remain pending in state and federal courts , mainly in states bordering the Gulf . \n`` The report indicates that Halliburton bears a larger share of responsibility , '' said Robert Gordon , a partner at Weitz & Luxenberg PC in New York who represents 500 commercial fishermen , hotels , and other spill-related clients . \n`` This is additional evidence demonstrating Halliburton 's callous disregard for safety of workers on the rig , and those who rely on Gulf waters for their livelihoods , '' he added . \nMore evidence about the quality of the cement may surface after the New Orleans federal judge overseeing much of the oil spill litigation signed an order releasing cement that had been subpoenaed by federal investigators . \n`` No destructive testing on the cementing components will be conducted without further order of the court , '' Judge Carl Barbier wrote in his order , released on Friday . \nJ. David Anderson , an analyst at JPMorgan , had not foreseen significant liability for Halliburton , but said `` that may change '' if Thursday 's commission report has wide impact . \n`` Importantly , BP chose the cement , tested it , and then signed off on it , '' he wrote in a research report . \n`` According to the contract with BP , Halliburton is indemnified even in the case of gross negligence . \nThen again , that does n't preclude the Department of Justice from pursuing criminal indictments . '' \nMary Wood , a University of Oregon law professor and director of the school 's environmental and natural resources law program , said Halliburton would be vulnerable if its activities rose to the level of negligence . \n`` A company could be held negligent if it did not act as a reasonable person would , '' she said . \n`` BP is responsible for natural resource damages regardless of fault . \nBut if I were Halliburton 's lawyers , I would consider this -LRB- report -RRB- very bad news indeed . '' \nHalliburton could ultimately face criminal charges under the Clean Water Act , along with BP and Transocean , as well as civil penalties , said Uhlmann of the University of Michigan . \nBut he said liability to victims could be limited , depending on how many chose to tap the $ 20 billion victims fund . \n`` They might be better off going to the fund , where money will be available within several months , rather than litigate , where money may not be available , if at all , for several years .

{"id": "641", "time": "2010-07-01", "text": "HOUSTON | Thu Jul 1 , 2010 7:46 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tropical storm Alex slowed oil spill clean-up and containment work in the Gulf of Mexico and drove more petroleum into fragile Gulf wetlands and beaches on Thursday , with any permanent fix to BP Plc 's ruptured deep-sea well still several weeks away . \nMore than 10 weeks into the crisis , oil continued spewing into the Gulf , clean-up success remained limited and a proposal by the Obama administration to halt all deep-water drilling for the next six months remained in limbo . \nWashington 's attention has also been distracted by the recent firing of U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan and the fate of a huge financial reform bill . \nThis week nature added to the problems as Alex crossed the Gulf . \nThe storm made landfall as a hurricane over northeastern Mexico well to the west of the spill site , but its high winds and rough seas thwarted plans by BP to expand the volume of oil it is siphoning from the well . \nThe bad weather also pushed more oil-polluted water onto the shoreline of the U.S. Gulf Coast and forced the halt of skimming , spraying of dispersant chemicals and controlled burns of oil on the ocean surface . \n`` It has brought in oil , unfortunately , from the panhandle of Florida to Louisiana , right now , at a higher rate than it has been over the last few days , '' Robert Dudley , chief of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration efforts , said of the storm 's effect in a live PBS online interview . \nHe said the storm had spawned waves of 8 to 12 feet in some parts of the Gulf . \nThe worst oil spill in U.S. history , entering its 73rd day on Thursday , has unleashed an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions along the Gulf Coast , idling much of the region 's fishing and tourism industries , soiling its beaches and marshlands and killing wildlife . \nMillions of barrels of crude oil have gushed nonstop from the floor of the Gulf , about 50 miles off Louisiana , since an April 20 explosion that demolished the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 crewmen . \nBP says the target date for two relief wells to intercept and plug the blown-out well remains early to mid-August . \nThe British energy giant drew harsh criticism earlier in the crisis , but some of the political heat has cooled since President Barack Obama pressured the company to set up a $ 20 billion fund for damages and lawmakers hammered BP executives at congressional hearings . \nIn Washington on Thursday , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to give families of those killed in the oil rig explosion greater latitude to sue for damages . \nAnd the House Transportation Committee met to negotiate proposed legislation to hold vessels and facilities more accountable for oil spills . \nThe White House , meanwhile , said it expected to release details of a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium in the next few days . \nA federal court order last week blocked the government 's initial ban on drilling exploratory and development wells in waters more than 500 feet deep , and a revised plan could still face legal challenges . \nIn an interview with Reuters , International Energy Agency head Nobuo Tanaka said a moratorium `` makes sense '' while a presidential commission investigates the spill 's cause . \nBut he said the world still relied on oil and gas , and that rigs idled in the Gulf should leave to search for resources elsewhere . \nBP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began . \nBut shares have shown signs of stabilizing . \nThey closed nearly 2 percent higher in New York on Thursday , after ending the day up almost 3 percent in London . \nPacific Investment Management Co. -LRB- PIMCO -RRB- , which manages the world 's biggest bond fund , said on Thursday it is buying more debt of some of the companies involved in the oil spill disaster , though it did not cite specific corporations . \nSeparately , Mark Kiesel , head of the PIMCO corporate bond portfolio management group , wrote in an article that BP had hefty amounts of cash on hand , strong operating cash flow and could sell assets to raise money if needed . \nIn the Gulf of Mexico , seas were still too rough on Thursday to allow skimming to resume , and Coast Guard officials said they doubted it would be calm enough on Friday , either . \n`` The weather today , unfortunately , looks much the same as yesterday . \nOperations will likely be curtailed , '' Coast Guard Commander Charles Diorio said on a conference call . \n`` We expect the seas to start to calm down as we get into Friday and further into the weekend , '' Diorio said . \nIn bays and estuaries , work crews were replacing boom dislodged or damaged by the storm , but the Coast Guard had no estimate on the extent of damage . \nThe storm surge from Alex also pushed oil more toward the northwest , in the direction of Mississippi and Louisiana , after a week in which the slick had crept mainly toward the northeast , washing up on Florida Panhandle beaches . \nThe weather delayed BP plans to boost containment capacity at the undersea well , but relief well drilling continued . \nA government spokeswoman said on Thursday a massive ship converted into a `` super skimmer '' had arrived in the Gulf to assist with the cleanup . \nThe 1,100-foot -LRB- 335 meter -RRB- vessel , dubbed the `` A Whale , '' was provided by its owner , TMT Shipping of Taiwan , officials said . \nGovernment officials estimate 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- of oil pour from the ruptured wellhead each day . \nBP 's containment systems can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily and its planned addition could raise that to 53,000 . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nDoes someone you know have a story to tell that BP is trying to cover up ? \nHelp us tell

{"id": "224", "time": "2010-07-06", "text": "NEW YORK | Tue Jul 6 , 2010 5:28 am EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Obama administration may succeed in pushing through its offshore drilling ban , despite fierce resistance from the oil industry , since a piece of machinery in short supply has left oil companies and the environment glaringly vulnerable to another oil spill . \nThe offshore skimming devices -- seagoing vessels that suck up spilled crude -- are the first line of defense in the contingency plans that big oil companies are required to submit when they drill in the deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico . \nBut the vast majority of skimming capacity listed in `` worst case scenario '' plans to combat major Gulf spills is already deployed to clean up BP 's leak , according to copies of the plans made public by Congress and lists of vessels active in the cleanup that were obtained by Reuters . \nWith few skimmers in reserve , any new spill could be harder to fight , including one caused by a hurricane during the Atlantic storm season that forecasters say could be one of the most intense on record . \nThat may give U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar the justification he needs to quickly issue a new deepwater drilling ban after a district court struck a first one down . \n`` We are working hard to issue a new moratorium in the coming days , '' Interior Department spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said , without offering further details . \nBP , Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Oil Co , among the biggest operators in the Gulf , would rely largely on the same armada of skimmers , according to contingency plans that were released by lawmakers investigating the BP blow-out . \nMany of those vessels are among the 58 largest skimmers already cleaning up the biggest Gulf spill ever , one that has forced the closure of more than 80,000 square miles of fishing area and put the future of U.S. offshore drilling in doubt . \nFor instance , 84 percent of the skimming capacity Shell lists in its Eastern Gulf `` worst case scenario '' spill contingency plan is engaged in the BP effort , according to an equipment manifest given to Reuters . \nTwo big spill response firms told Reuters that over 90 percent of their resources are already at work on BP 's spill . \nThe bulk of skimmers listed in oil companies ' contingency plans are controlled by a single spill response firm , Virginia-based Marine Spill Response Corp. -LRB- MSRC -RRB- , formed and funded collectively by big oil companies after Alaska 's Valdez spill in 1989 and run by a former BP executive . \nWith BP 's blow-out still gushing up to 60,000 barrels per day , the Gulf clean-up effort may drag on for months or years , even if BP can plug its blown-out well in August as planned . \nFollowing the Valdez spill , offshore skimming vessels remained in action for more than a year . \n`` If you do n't have the equipment to respond to a spill , you ca n't be allowed to drill , '' said Dan Lawn , a former oil safety inspector for Alaska 's Department of Environmental Conservation . \n`` The contingency plans should be revoked because they are worthless right now . '' \nThe U.S. Coast Guard , charged with overseeing offshore spill response , did not respond to requests for comment . \nU.S. District Judge Martin Feldman of New Orleans last month struck down the Obama administration 's first moratorium issued in May -- which halted drilling in waters deeper than 500 feet for six months . \nFeldman ruled it `` arbitrary and capricious . '' \nWhile any ban is controversial since U.S. Gulf oil projects account for a third of the country 's oil production and thousands of jobs , Salazar pledged to press ahead regardless . \nGrilled on Wednesday by a Congressman who said a ban would bring irreparable harm to Louisiana 's offshore industry , Salazar said : `` The greater irreparable harm would be if there was another blowout , when there is not the oil response capability to even deal with the current Horizon event . '' \nMore than 7,000 U.S. Gulf-based spill response vessels -- including skimming units -- and around 50,000 people are involved in the Horizon cleanup , the largest and most complex spill response ever . \nThe vessels have recovered more than 28 million gallons of oil-water mixture so far . \nThe deployment of skimmers at BP 's spill has expanded more than fivefold since early June , and 550 skimmers were at work as of Friday , according to a release from spill responders . \nThey expected 750 skimmers in action by August . \nIn preparation for offshore disasters , scores of skimming vessels are usually kept at staging areas in the Gulf Coast , but few are idle now . \nBP 's Gulf contingency plans call for racing skimmers to a Gulf spill in as little as 6.5 hours . \nA contingency plan for Shell , the No. 2 Gulf producer , shows it could race 24 skimmers with capacity to suck up 162,752 of oil per day to a potential blow-out . \nAt least 16 of the skimmers , and all of the largest ones , are engaged . \nThose that may still be available could collect less than 25,818 barrels , the vessel lists showed . \nShell declined comment on its Gulf contingency plans . \nA person close to the company said Shell 's contingency plan for the Gulf envisages an unlikely scenario with multiple spills . \nThere is a `` considerable amount '' of safety equipment available still available , the person said , and Shell would still rely on a Gulf-based fleet of skimmers . \nIn addition , Shell could quickly import more boom , dispersant and other safety gear from Europe , the person said . \nTo be sure , skimmers are no silver bullet . \nThey often collect less than 20 percent of oil that reaches the sea surface , experts say . \nBut used with barges , tugs , absorbent booms and dispersants , skimmers play a major part in keeping oil from fouling beaches , especially if they are deployed fast . \nSome support is already arriving from abroad . \nOne Taiwanese vessel that arrived this week , the so-called A Whale , is a converted supertanker with capacity to process up to 500,000 barrels per day of oil and water mix . \nIt may gain Coast Guard approval to operate this weekend . \nBut the bulk of the world 's offshore skimmers are on standby for spill responses elsewhere . \nOnly 15 foreign response vessels were at work on the Gulf spill last week . \nAnd even the A Whale is unlikely to free up other U.S. skimmers from their ongoing work , since an aggressive spill response requires up to hundreds of agile skimmers to cover the rapidly-expanding area of oil slicks , experts say . \nBP 's spill is no longer a single slick but a `` massive collection of smaller patches of oil , '' response commanders wrote on Friday . \nHurricanes bring more risk for oil companies in the Gulf , often requiring the deployment of skimmers after they pass . \nIn 2005 , Katrina ravaged the region , laying waste to several drilling platforms and causing spills of at least 6.5 million gallons , more than half of the Valdez spill volume . \nAfter the Valdez disaster , MSRC deployed seven of its largest , ` responder-class ' skimmers during the 2005 storm season . \nToday , 12 of the firm 's 15 responder-class vessels are dedicated to BP 's spill , MSRC spokeswoman Judith Roos said . \nThe firm also operates dozens of smaller skimmers . \n`` Should another event occur , the Coast Guard has the authority to determine where to direct our resources , '' Roos said . \nShell , BP and Exxon Mobil 's contingency plans all call for relying heavily on MSRC skimmers . \nEmployees at National Response Corp. and Ampol , the two other response firms listed in all three companies ' Gulf response plans , told Reuters they have deployed more than 90 percent of the equipment they had available in the Gulf . \n-LRB- Reporting by Joshua Schneyer ; editing by Alden Bentley and David Gregorio -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI own stock in BP -LRB- Sob ! -RRB- \n, which until the spill paid me enough dividends to buy a few dozen nice lunches each year . \nBut I also believe all industries should engage in responsible business practices . \nAnd its just crazy to engage in deep water drilling until the Deepwater Horizon spill is fully capped . \nThis Judge , Martin Feldman , ho overturned the Obama Administration 's moratorium must be one of the right-wing , anything goes for business leftovers from the Bush administration . \nHe should be ashamed of himself ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "139", "time": "2010-07-06", "text": "Kimberly Kindy has an excellent and very sobering report on the monstrous discrepancies between the various numbers being bandied around when it comes to the amount of oil that BP is able to skim off the Gulf of Mexico every day . \nAs commenter hsvkitty points out , BP only got the permits to start drilling at the Deepwater Horizon site in the first place because the Minerals Management Service believed their statement that they could recover 197 percent of the daily discharge from an uncontrolled blowout of 250,000 barrels per day : a March report from BP said that it had the capacity to skim and remove 491,721 barrels of oil per day . \nEven after the explosion , BP was still insisting that it had `` skimming capacity of more than 171,000 barrels per day , with more available if needed . '' \nSo far , it has managed to skim less than 900 barrels per day . \nAdd burn-offs , and you get to just over 300,000 barrels in total , over 77 days -- that 's less than 4,000 barrels per day . \nBP 's reaction to being massively wrong , by a factor of over 100 , is to grab onto the biggest numbers it can find -- to try , in other words , to deal with the optics , rather than the reality . \nTake the much-vaunted super-skimmer , for instance . \nSome reports say that it `` can collect up to half a million barrels of oil a day '' , but it 's much more accurate to say that it can theoretically collect that many barrels of contaminated water , which is only about 10 % oil . \nAnd , as Kindy drily notes , `` thus far , it has been unable to produce those results in the gulf . '' \nBP knew full well that a blow-out at the Deepwater Horizon site would involve oil bubbling up to the surface from miles below sea level , rather than being spilled directly onto the surface from a tanker . \nBut it never seemed to stop to think that much of the oil would never surface . \nBP also said that much of its skimming capacity would come from outsourcing skimming operations to Marine Spill Response -- but BP never asked MSR whether they could hit its marks , and neither did MMS , when BP submitted its insanely overoptimistic numbers . \nAll of which is a sign of the knee-jerk credulity that most of us exhibit when faced with a large and seemingly highly accurate number . \n491,721 , you say ? \nWell , that must be true -- or at least in the ballpark . \nIt would be interesting to compare that number with other oil companies ' projections of their oil-skimming capacity in the Gulf . \nTheir rigs have n't exploded , of course , but what did they say they could skim off in the event that the unthinkable were to happen ? \nIn hindsight , it seems that any number over a few thousand barrels per day would clearly have been a massive overestimate . \nBut of course the bigger the number submitted , the easier it was to get the necessary approvals . \nYou can see why BP exaggerated so much , and why there would have been enormous incentives for its rivals to do likewise . \nand then there are the restrictive labor and environmental rules that exacerbated the situation . \nYou 'd think that if your coastline was facing imminent doom , you would accept help from whoever was willing to provide it . \nso when we learn that the numbers submitted were BS , what 's our ability to sue or criminally prosecute based on such lies ? \n@milesk , I was wondering the same thing myself . \nAfter all , I am criminally liable if I file a false tax return . \nAnd `` everyone else is doing it '' has n't worked for me since the first grade . \nI would think that it would be criminal charges against the corporation , rather than one or more individuals . \nHowever , when a corporate entity is involved , there is usually a bit of wiggle room , such as a deferred prosecution agreement . \nUltimately , my guess is that even if it were possible , there is no appetite for bringing BP down . \nSeems like this would be another great piece of evidence for the criminal case -LRB- with unlimited liabilities on a per barrel basis -RRB- that the DoJ is building . \nAlso , `` A Whale '' was initially turned down by BP and the Coast Guard -LRB- hell , it was only hastily retrofitted in the Netherlands to perform this skimming duty . -RRB- \nCome on Americans , this is your backyard ! \nThis is an upward flow against gravity that pulls down . \nIt can be stopped by some easy tricks on fluid dynamics using concepts of surface transport of particles . \nBubbling flow upward can be clogged by high density objects coming down by gravity pull . \nInstead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . \nWe do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . \nHydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . \nThe use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . \nI am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . \nTry to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . \nThis OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . \nMr. Obamas assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . \nA person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . \nThis way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . \nI suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . \nWhy to ignore science ? \nJust imagine if the well could be clogged in few hours by appropriate approach making gravity pull heavy objects downward on a bubbling upward flow with variable flow velocity due to the dragging effect of well casing . \nThe relief wells may not work as clay in the mud can only clog tiny pores but fail on cracks and fissures . \nI believe this entire nightmare is preventable and consequence of a failing leadership you have . \nHow would I stop the spill ? \nEasily running some trials with a visible display employing translucent 22 in pipes with similar upward flow and check the dragging effect on many particle sizes and formats . \nThe bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . \nWhen we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles . \nLower and lower velocity suggests smaller and smaller particles until clay can be used to seal tiny pores inside the well lumen . \nWhat am I charging for it ? \nI just want USPTO to stop violating my scientific discovery US pat . \n6,766,817 with flawed patents that even do not work shamefully harming and dishonoring HYDROLOGY . \nI got PhD at Penn State University and Bill Clinton was the speecher of my commencement on May 10 , 1996 . \nCNN is controlling info by removing comments on its website . \nI am curious who takes advantages by this ongoing catastrophe . \nThere was\\/is a lot of research completed , but like most things the cleanup was self regulatory and permits given at their word . \nAre other oil companies as wrecklass in their estimates ? \nI hate to answer your question with a question ... but here it is ... Clueless and inept is really the only way to describe the ongoing situation at MMS , said Mike Senatore , vice president for Conservation Law at Defenders of Wildlife . \nThis agency is at the epicenter of the worst environmental disaster in our nation s history and yet it s still going about business as usual . \nHow else do you explain MMS s approval of the right to drill hundreds of new wells in the Gulf , including 13 for BP , based on the same fundamentally flawed and patently illegal environmental documents used to green-light the Deepwater Horizon operation ? \nThe most recent lease was handed out on June 10 and all over-state their capacity for clean up , hastily handed out to beat the moratorium . \nNow that the MMS has been renamed `` The New Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation , and Enforcement -LRB- BOEMRE -RRB- things are bound to get better . \nIt 's hard to keep your foot on somone 's throat when you got your hands in their wallet . . \nA huge boodoogle by the Obama admin and BP . \nThere are many good and better solutions that be implemented by the more experienced professionals , but BP has to save face and the Obama conies are too inept to make a difference . \nThis mess has turned into an colossal disaster . \nThe worst part of it is we can not fix it until Obama is removed from office . \nI hear that BP shareholders are planning to sue the US gov bc BP did not use the safety equipment which was developed after the 1988 Piper Alpha explosion -LRB- google it -RRB- , which is mandatory in most of the world . \nThe US gov standards are lax and thus caused the spill , wiping out shareholder value , so they are seeking compensation makes sense . ? \nIn this deregulated world of ours , there 's a whole lot of skimming going on . \nJust not much of it actually helping clean up carelessly spilled oil , or any of the other greasy lubricants of inhumane unkindness . \nTruth is , things wo n't get a whole lot better until guys in expensive suits can be reduced to tears over every last drop of milken spillage they have wrought . \nSpill response plans are designed to fail because they emphasize the amount of oil that can be pumped rather than the amount of area that can be covered by skimming systems . \nSpills spread very quickly to a very thin average oil layer , much less than 1 mm average thickness , so the real problem is concentrating the oil so the it can be recovered faster than it spreads . \nRegulators must first account for the spreading of spills in high currents and severe weather and only then approve the skimming systems that can reliably and quickly cover the large areas predicted by spill dispersion models . \nThere are fast skimmers that can be configured to safely operate in high seas but they are not used because regulators only calculate the theoretical oil pumping rate when approving response plans . \nFor example , BP claimed its skimmers could recover 491,000 bbl\\/day but they actually recovered less than 900 bbl\\/day , more than 545 times less than claimed . \nOnce the industry is compelled to use the ASTM F1780-97 methodology or the NOAA Mechanical Equipment Calculator , that factor in the area that can be covered by skimming systems , we 'll have a much more effective spill response capability . \nBP has been denied by US companies to use Piper Alpha and later equipment . \nThe US companies use existing laws to block assistance . \nTo skim and recover 500 000 bbl per day would be a huge operation -- that is a new VLCC -LRB- tanker -RRB- every 4 day . \nBut , remove the drilling turret on a FPSO , and you have the device -- of course , not invented in the `` land of the brave '' . \nWhat to do with the recovered crude remains to be addressed , because a refinery can not take it since the condensates will have evaporated . \nThere has been a similar disaster further south . \nPDVSA in Venezuela lost an oil rig on one of their -LRB- wet-gas -RRB- fields . \nBut with safety regulations in place , identical to the North Sea , not a pint was spilled , nobody was killed -- but the rig sank . \nJust as when a person is about to drown at sea , he should not deny help because `` I only want to be saved by Pamela Anderson as in Baywatch '' . \nWhen you drown -- your relatives have no sympathy here -LRB- or anywhere else -RRB- . \nThey will admit that silliness killed you . \nThe same is the law in the Mexican Gulf : deny help and do not blame anyone later . \nBP and USCG have been employing an `` Out-of-Sight , Out-of-Mind '' strategy with the excessive use of dispersants and media control and restriction . \nThe National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan , more commonly called NCP , is the federal government s blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases . \nPursuant to NCP Section 300.310 , As appropriate , actions shall be taken to recover the oil or mitigate its effects . \nOf the numerous chemical or physical methods that may be used , the chosen methods shall be the most consistent with protecting public health and welfare and the environment . \nSinking agents shall not be used . \nSinking agents means those additives applied to oil discharges to sink floating pollutants below the water surface . \nThe question is whether BP s dispersants are sinking agents when they are applied a mile underwater at the source of the well leak . \nBP and USCG are knowingly and systematically underestimating the size of the spill to limit the financial impact on the oil company . \nUnder the CWA , the company faces fines of up to $ 4,300 for each barrel spilled . \nFurthermore , pursuant to Section 2702 of OPA 90 , BP may be required to pay royalties -LRB- 18.75 % -RRB- owed to the federal government for the oil gushing from the well . \nFor a clear understanding of the issues involved , visit : Collection of the BP oil spill has never been a `` skimming '' operation . \nThis `` spill '' is a gusher of oil being released from the seafloor , approximately one-mile below the sea surface . \nUSCG is using conventional skimmers , boom and dispersants normally deployed for inland waterway surface oil spills . \nBP and USCG will eventually use tankers to collect the oil that has been released into the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon blowout of April 20 , 2010 . \nUnfortunately , this decision will be made after the devastation of many coastal communities . \nThe blowout of April 20 , 2010 aboard the Deepwater Horizon was clearly preventable . \nThe fact that the BP oil spill has been allowed to reach coastal areas is inexcusable . \nFor a clear understanding of the issues involved , visit : We welcome comments that

{"id": "1793", "time": "2010-07-06", "text": "HOUSTON\\/NEW YORK | Tue Jul 6 , 2010 7:58 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Drilling of a relief well to halt the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a week ahead of schedule , the U.S. official overseeing the response to the disaster said on Tuesday . \nThe prospect of an earlier completion of the well , seen as the most promising way to plug the oil leaking from BP 's blown-out undersea well , could help bolster the energy giant 's battered shares , which rose about 9 percent in New York trade . \nBut Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters in Houston that crews were still aiming to finish drilling two relief wells in mid-August , and he shot down speculation that the first of the two wells could plug the leak in July . \nBP shares continued a recent rally after the British energy giant said it could cover the costs of the spill without selling new shares , despite reports it was talking to government-owned funds in the Middle East about buying a stake to ward off takeover attempts . \n`` Any positive news as far as expediting what they 've been trying for a long time now will be a further catalyst for buyers to get in , '' said Alan Lancz , president at Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo , Ohio . '' \n... anything that would speed up the process or any kind of success at all as far as capping it would be a welcome relief . \nThen you can get down to a definitive range of liability . \nWhile it 's spilling , it 's very difficult to ascertain what the total costs will be , '' he said . \nAllen , who spoke minutes after markets had closed in New York , also said a third vessel at the leak site that will nearly double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 now was partially hooked up on Tuesday , but rough seas hampered efforts to finish the job . \nEstimates of the leak 's severity vary widely and run as high as a 100,000 barrels per day . \nBP is already committed to but not ultimately restricted to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nIts costs to date have topped $ 3 billion and are rising steeply . \nBut the ultimate costs may well depend on how much crude is determined to have leaked from the well that blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nInvestors are keenly eyeing containment efforts . \nAnalysts said that barring other negative news , the stock may have found a floor with its New York closing price of $ 26.97 on June 25 . \nShares are up 16 percent since the close on that day . \n`` All the negative news on the stock has had its impact , '' said Kurt Wulff , president at McDep LLC , an oil and gas research firm in Needham , Massachusetts . \n`` We 're optimistic that the news can get better from there . \nThe talk about sovereign buyers may not lead to anything , but it certainly means that value-orientated investors are seeing opportunity . '' \nAt one stage during the spill , BP had lost $ 100 billion in market value . \nThe spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , fishing communities and a tourist industry seen as especially important during a time of high unemployment . \nIt has also thrust itself to the top of President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and presented a tough test for his leadership . \nA source in the United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday that BP executives held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar , as well as one in Singapore , to find a partner who might help it avoid being taken over . \n`` BP is seeking a strategic partner so it does n't get taken over by other major oil companies such as Exxon and Total , '' the source said . \nBP declined to comment on talk of a stake sale . \nIt did say there were no plans to issue new equity to anyone , allaying some investors ' fears of a share issue to help pay for a spill expected to cost tens of billions of dollars . \n`` We 're always happy to welcome new shareholders or existing shareholders who wish to increase their holdings , but there 's no plans to issue new equity to anyone , '' a BP spokesman said . \nA top 10 shareholder said any move to issue shares would be viewed extremely negatively . \n`` It will be a kind of suicide note -- people will turn up with flamethrowers at management , '' the shareholder said . \nSeveral sovereign funds already hold BP stakes . \nNorway and Kuwait control about 1.8 percent each , China has 1.1 percent and Singapore 0.7 percent , according to Thomson Reuters data . \nRoyal Bank of Scotland upgraded BP to `` buy '' from `` hold . '' \n`` Our base case scenario is significantly less pessimistic and in our view , the risk\\/reward profile of the shares is currently favorable , '' it said in a note . \nJust two out of 37 brokers have an `` underperform '' or `` sell '' rating on BP 's stock , and over two-thirds rate it `` buy '' or `` strong buy , '' according to Thomson Reuters data . \nThe stock 's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio makes it easily the cheapest among the major oil companies . \nBritain 's The Times newspaper reported the British government was drafting contingency plans for a possible BP collapse . \nThe British government declined to comment . \nTests showed tar balls washed up on the Texas coast were from the spill , meaning every U.S. Gulf state -- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and now Texas -- has been soiled by the largest offshore oil spill in the country 's history . \nTexas asked BP for a $ 25 million block grant to help fund its cleanup . \nBP has provided similar funds to other states that have had crude wash ashore , and the credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's said that money was keeping the spill damage from affecting the credit ratings of affected states . \nThere was a chance disturbed weather over the southern Gulf of Mexico could strengthen into a tropical storm this week , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said . \nAlthough it was not expected to travel over the site of the blown-out BP well , it could come closer than Hurricane Alex , which interrupted the cleanup operations last week . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe company has been , for two weeks , trying to get a corporate bond deal done , but investors are too scared of the legal risk surrounding the company ... antecdotal reports also of some interesting plant-damaging rainfall a ways away also . . \nlots of stuff going on regarding this leak . . \ngood luck , America . . \nCome on Americans , this is your backyard ! \nThis is an upward flow against gravity that pulls down . \nIt can be stopped by some easy tricks on fluid dynamics using concepts of surface transport of particles . \nBubbling flow upward can be clogged by high density objects coming down by gravity pull . \nInstead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . \nWe do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . \nHydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . \nThe use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . \nI am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . \nTry to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . \nThis OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . \nMr. Obamas assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . \nA person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . \nThis way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . \nI suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . \nWhy to ignore science ?

'' \nDemocrats said the bill would make offshore drilling safer for workers , while also protecting the environment and Gulf Coast business from future oil spills like the one caused by BP that damaged wetlands and hurt the region 's fishing and tourism industries . \n`` This legislation is about safety , about establishing new safety standards , safety for the workers on the rigs , '' said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . \n`` If you want to apologize for Big Oil , go right ahead , but the American people are not on your side on this one , '' Democratic Representative Jim McGovern told his Republican colleagues during a long day of debate . \nBefore passing the bill , the House also approved an amendment to help smaller oil companies compete for Gulf of Mexico drilling projects under the proposed reforms . \nThe amendment would let them pool their resources in demonstrating they have the financial resources to deal with potential oil spills . \nThe House vote on the bill was close , as several Democrats representing districts with strong oil industry interests joined Republicans in opposition . \nRepresentative Gene Green , from the oil industry-dominated city of Houston , was one of those Democrats . \n`` There are a lot of things in there that have nothing to do with safety '' of offshore drilling operations , Green told reporters . \nA sticking point in the Senate is opposition from Republicans and some moderate Democrats to removing all liability limits oil companies would face for economic damages stemming from the BP disaster and any future spills . \nCurrent law requires companies to only cover up to $ 75 million for damages to local economies . \nThe BP spill could end up costing billions of dollars in lost tourism , fishing and other Gulf Coast revenues . \nBP has said it would pay for all costs related to the spill , but many lawmakers worry that the company could put victims through years of litigation . \nThe Senate energy bill has an added component : new incentives to encourage more natural gas-powered trucks and electric vehicles to clean up the environment . \nIt also provides $ 5 billion to help improve home energy efficiency . \nBut Senate Democrats abandoned attempts to attach climate change provisions that would have set mandatory limits on some companies ' carbon dioxide emissions . \nSenate leaders plan to hold a test vote next Wednesday to gauge support for the bill , according to a Democratic aide . \nBut Republicans , and possibly some moderate Democrats , might block a full debate , forcing senators to take it up in September . \nThe House also approved a separate bill on Friday to give whistle-blower protection to workers who report violations in offshore drilling rules . \n-LRB- Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sofina Mirza-Reid -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nAll the big oil companies have had disasters , and now they want to change the rules because its not one of their own These companies will just uplift their rigs and go elsewhere , they can not afford millions of dollars a day just to sit idle . \nAmerica like the rest of the world needs oil , renewable energy is still a long way off Is this government trying to eliminate all non-government and non-union jobs ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe U.S. Justice Department also requested that the lawsuits be handled by a New Orleans federal court . \n`` The U.S. is not a party at present in the cases against corporate defendants , but we think we will be , '' Justice Department representative Steven Flynn told the panel . \nHe said New Orleans `` would provide the best access to all litigants . '' \nWhichever court , or courts , end up overseeing the cases could grapple with them for years . \nThe panel , formally known as the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation , will decide whether the cases belong under the umbrella of one court , or potentially several . \nBP asked that the cases be combined in Houston , the U.S. oil capital , as did an attorney for Cameron International Corp , manufacturer of the blowout preventer on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded on April 20 . \nBP pushed ahead with plans to sell assets in Vietnam , Colombia and Venezuela , as it scrambles to hive off $ 30 billion of assets to pay for the cleanup . \nBankers said many of the most likely bidders are already part owners of the assets BP wants to sell , and this could help speed up the sales . \nIncoming Chief Executive Bob Dudley said on Wednesday BP would stay involved with the cleanup long after the well was finally plugged , which he said could happen next week . \nAlthough the flow of oil has been stopped , experts say the clean-up operation will take months . \nThe major oil slicks appear to have dispersed and experts are analyzing the extent of pollution in the sea . \nAn area of nearly 60,000 square miles -LRB- 150,000 sq km -RRB- of Gulf of Mexico waters is closed to fishing and more than 600 miles -LRB- 950 km -RRB- of coastline in four U.S. states is affected by oil , according to the latest U.S. government reports . \nEnvironmentalists have said it could be years before some Gulf beaches are declared free of toxic pollutants . \nShares of BP -- which has lost about 40 percent of its market value since the blast -- closed 2 percent higher in New York on Thursday . \nIts London shares closed up 2.7 percent . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey would need to prove that the way they conduct their business differed significantly from the way BP does theirs and that their sub contractors operated in a different manner from how they worked with BP . \nLeading one to ask of the sub contractor , how a valid risk assessment for doing a job could have two acceptable methods of enforcement . \nand to ask the same question of the regulators in the employment of the US government . \nThe drilling ban was enforced by the US government and as such opens no line of action by Shell against BP . \nThe investigation into this incident has a significant purpose to find out how the different companies operate their drilling rigs and who authorised the different regimes as acceptable practice . \nThis goes outside of a ` Get BP ` mentality . \nThe US government had a responsibility to set down the standards by which drilling was to be conducted and the procedures to be followed . \nTo date it has shown itself to be woefully incompetent . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Exxon 's website calls it The Valdez Oil Spill -RRB- , previously the biggest spill off the United States at 37,000 tonnes . \nBy my maths , the Baltic Sea spill killed one bird for about every 80 grams of oil -LRB- ... an amount easily spilt when filling up a car -RRB- , the BP spill -LRB- so far -RRB- one per 200-330 tonnes . \nEven tiny amounts of oil can mean that birds ' feathers stick together and let chill water , like in the Baltic Sea , get to their bodies through what is normally a layer of insulation . \nThey can then die of cold . \n`` There is no clear relationship between the amount of oil in the marine environment and the likely impact on wildlife . \nA smaller spill at the wrong time\\/wrong season and in a sensitive environment may prove much more harmful than a larger spill at another time of the year in another or even the same environment . \nEven small spills can have very large effects , '' it says . \n`` In a cold climate an oil spot the size of 2-3 square centimetres can be enough to kill a bird , '' it says . \nIt also says that penguins give another example of a how small spills can cause big problems for birds . \nA collision of two oil tankers off South Africa in 1977 released 31,000 tonnes of oil and polluted just 47 African penguins , it says . \nBut a far smaller spill of 1,000 tonnes of oil after the sinking of the Treasure in 2000 oiled 20,000 penguins and another 20,000 were removed from their breeding colonies on Dassen and Robben islands to avoid getting them soiled . \nThe conclusion : do n't spill oil . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBased in Oslo ; my previous postings included Paris , Central America , Brussels and London . \n"}

'' \nPhoto shows a protester holding a syrup covered plastic earth ball to protest against the BP oil spill on the North side of the White House in Washington June 16 , 2010 . \nREUTERS\\/Larry Downing Come on Americans , this is your backyard ! \nThis is an upward flow against gravity that pulls down . \nIt can be stopped by some easy tricks on fluid dynamics using concepts of surface transport of particles . \nBubbling flow upward can be clogged by high density objects coming down by gravity pull . \nInstead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . \nWe do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . \nHydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . \nThe use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . \nI am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . \nTry to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . \nUSPTO has near 6,000 Patent Examiners and it already confirmed that none of them is a Hydrologist ! \nThis OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . \nMr. Obama assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . \nA person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . \nThis way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . \nI suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . \nWhy to ignore science ? \nI already sent Mr. Obama 14 lettters regarding violations of Hydrology getting no reply . \nMy doubt is if people at the White House read English or people around there do not need to care about their country outcome . \nJust imagine if the well could be clogged in few hours by appropriate approach making gravity pull heavy objects downward on a bubbling upward flow with variable flow velocity due to the dragging effect of well casing . \nThe relief wells may not work as clay in the mud can only clog tiny pores but fail on cracks and fissures . \nWhat is the chance that PB hires any Soil Scientist in the technical staff ? \nWhat is the chance that BP Engineers ever learned about Soil Erosion to understand detachment , transport , and deposition of particles in a dynamic flow ? \nI believe this entire nightmare is preventable and consequence of a failing leadership you have . \nHow would I stop the spill ? \nEasily running some trials with a visible display employing translucent 22 in pipes with similar upward flow and check the dragging effect on many particle sizes and formats . \nThe bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . \nWhen we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles . \nLower and lower velocity suggests smaller and smaller particles until clay can be used to seal tiny pores inside the well lumen definitively . \nWhat am I charging for it ? \nI just want USPTO to stop violating my scientific discovery US pat . \n6,766,817 with flawed patents that even do not work shamefully harming and dishonoring HYDROLOGY . \nI got PhD at Penn State University and Bill Clinton was the speecher of my commencement on May 10 , 1996 . \nCNN is controlling info by removing comments on its website . \nI am curious who takes advantages by this ongoing catastrophe . \nThe Valdez was a tanker that crashed with a finite amount of oil , not comparable . \nThe bottom line was and is BP is responsible to stop the leak in a timely manner . \nThree months and they are still battling this mess . \nThey were not prepared with solutions and that 's irresponsible . \nThe earned and deserve bad PR . \nPosted by GSH10 | Report as abusive Are Americans bullying BP ? \nRead Obama 's lips , the fish stinks from its head . \nI think the problem is that all the actions to date have been undertaken with the intent to save possible production from the well ; if they were really serious about stopping it they would 've blown it up the day after the rig sank -- period full stop . \nNo phony caps or junk shots , but a straight detonation -- the physics of explosions are much better understood than the technology of deepwater robotics . \nWould n't be so bad if the same thing did n't happen twenty-one years ago , trying the same tricks that did n't work , for months upon months . \nDifferent company , same issue . \nIt 's as if , 1 -RRB- they 're clueless , or 2 -RRB- they do n't care . \nBP has a history of playing fast and loose , paying fines as they go . \nAre we bullying them ? \nDo they deserve it ? \nIt 's absurd for anyone to expect any amount of sympathy for a soulless corporation , when the livelihood of so many ` little people ' are completely ruined because of their -LRB- BPs -RRB- mistake . \nBP 's first priority is BP in this case , not anything else . \nWhen companies made mistakes , they all rushed to the site to apologise ; Hayward stated he wanted his life back . \nA tearful apology might have eased the American anger a little , but their behavior is less then commendable . \nAre Americans bullying BP ? \nWould it be called bullying if a man got irate because someone threw a bunch of junk in their back garden ? \nThere 's a difference between spilling the rubbish bin in your own back garden and doing the same in the neighbor 's garden . \nThe author clearly supports big business despite the extreme damage done . \nThis is not something that BP can simply apologize for and expect to move on . \nThis is an ecological disaster that could and probably will have an effect on generations to come . \nIMO BP has not suffered nearly the damage that it has caused . \nAlthough there are efforts , BP has not returned things to the way they were before its negligence caused this tragedy . \nUntil they do , I say let the bullying go on ! \nBP -- BIG PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT I think that we are being too hard on BP . \nyes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . \nIt could have happened to any company and if we do n't change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! \nEase up everyone ... I live along the Gulf Coast and I will forgive . \nFrom an external , non-US , perspective America gives the impression that it no longer understands how business works and how it can be regulated ; all the way from the banks to the energy industry . \nAs evidenced by the banks , and now the oil industry , this leaves an open gap for those wishing to make profits or cut risky cost corners for their own or their corporate benefit to step through . \nThis lack of integration and understanding in government -LRB- eg drilling moratorium , Browner 's unlimited liability proposals etc. -RRB- leaves the US open to powerful non-democratic lobbies , like the Environmental Lobby , who have successfully campaigned against nuclear power , coal and now have the opportunity to shut-dwon the oil industry . \nWIth a lack of leadership in government there is only one way this can go . \nUnfortunately , the environmental zealots do not understand the unintended consequences risks , as they probably do n't with Climate Change hypotheses , of losing industrial capacity , jobs and wealth . \nLuckily , in a decade or so , we wo n't have to listen to America 's hegemonistic arrogance as we will have China and India with enough power to ensure that the new wealthy countries ' views are heard to the detriment of the US . \nIn this sense BP , as an individual entity , is not being targeted but the whole of the fossil fuel society is a target . \nI wonder if , in 10 years or so , the US will be rich enough to buy all those wind turbines and solar panels from China and India that they will need for their Green Revolution ? \nVery good points here . \nBeing involved in social media and passionate about Sustainability this is always a difficult question . \nIs the activism on the street more effective then online , or what do you do best to make your voice heard . \nI believe that we as stakeholders need to practice all of the possibilities we have at our disposal to make our voices and opinion heard . \nIn the the case of BP this is even more so the case because of the scale of the disaster . \nWe need to use all channels we have to oppose corporate malpractice . \nRight now I am using the blogosphere but next week I am doing something different to make my voice heard . \nThat is what I call sustained stakeholder activism . \nSurely this piece is a joke . \nDefinition of bully : To force one 's way aggressively or by intimidation . \nIf only we \\* could \\* bully BP ! \nClearly no one can make them do much . \nBut that 's what happens when you go far too far in deregulating industry . \nSpeaking of ... `` yes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . \nIt could have happened to any company and if we don t change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! '' \nBut it 's BP and their oily brethren that routinely pay high-powered lobbyists big bucks to lobby in DC to lessen restrictions in every way possible . \nToo many of people have bought into the ridiculous concept that deregulation is the key to a bright and glittering economic future . \nAnd the average lawmaker who 's being offered huge campaign contributions from industry will happily hop aboard the corporate gravy train unless there 's a loud enough outcry from mainstream voters to make it too dangerous to their re-election bids . \nIn short , BP and the rest of the industry has worked very hard for years to dictate `` current law and practice .

'' \nCompensation is a heated issue after the leak that began in April when a BP rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank killing 11 workers and unleashing millions of barrels of oil before it was plugged in July . \nThe decision to submit a claim is voluntary but anyone who provides paperwork in support of a claim would be paid within 48 hours if an individual and within one week if a business , Feinberg said . \nMany Gulf coast residents have been frustrated by the slow pace of the claims process and skeptical about whether they will get fair and prompt treatment . \n`` I do n't trust him , '' said Biloxi resident Linda StMartin after attending a town hall meeting . \n`` I think he is a very honorable man but I think he is boxed in by these very narrow proscribed limitations '' of the fund . \nBP set up the fund in June under White House pressure to make reparations for losses sustained in the fishing , tourism , housing and other industries in the Gulf coast states of Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nA separate $ 100 million is set aside for losses sustained due to a federal six-month moratorium on new offshore drilling . \nFeinberg was named compensation czar because of his reputation for fairness acquired administering the September 11 fund and determining executive pay for companies bailed out by the government after the financial crisis . \nBut the spill fund may provide an even tougher challenge , according to insurance experts who said calculating claims for businesses that have lost money is fraught with difficulty . \nOne point of dispute is the length of time during which people can file a claim before they must waive the right to also sue BP . \nAnother is the rules surrounding claims for a final payout , given that the full extent of losses from the spill remains unknown . \nFor the next six months , anyone claiming an emergency payment can also sue BP at a future date . \nBut beyond that period , claimants would forfeit the right to file against the company , Feinberg said . \nFlorida 's Attorney General Bill McCollum issued a statement last week saying the ruling favors BP and weakens provisions advocated by state attorney generals along the coast . \n`` The current process appears to be even less generous to Floridians than the BP process . \nSuch an outcome is completely unacceptable , '' McCollum said in a statement , echoed by one issued by Alabama 's attorney general . \nIn his defense , Feinberg said the idea for the cut-off point was his rather than BP 's . \n`` I am beholden to neither the administration nor BP . \nI am entirely independent , '' Feinberg said . \nHe said no decision had been taken on whether people who claimed after the six-month window would be able to sue other companies such as Transocean and Halliburton who were also involved with the rig . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPlease stop using this incorrect language in your reporting . \nWhat exactly is a czar , and why do we keep calling people in the Obama administration `` czar 's '' . \nIs it the stress test to see if a Democratic Black man can take the pressure from the fray ? \nSeems like after all of these disasters that you guys would want to be helping instead of tearing things down with innuendos . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}
{"id": "1325", "time": "2010-08-24", "text": "WASHINGTON | Tue Aug 24 , 2010 5:25 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Manhattan-sized plume of oil spewed deep into the Gulf of Mexico by BP 's broken Macondo well has been consumed by a newly discovered fast-eating species of microbes , scientists reported on Tuesday . \nThe micro-organisms were apparently stimulated by the massive oil spill that began in April , and they degraded the hydrocarbons so efficiently that the plume is now undetectable , said Terry Hazen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . \nThese so-called proteobacteria -- Hazen calls them `` bugs '' -- have adapted to the cold deep water where the big BP plume was observed and are able to biodegrade hydrocarbons much more quickly than expected , without significantly depleting oxygen as most known oil-depleting bacteria do . \nOxygen is essential to the survival of commercially important fish and shellfish ; a seasonal low-oxygen `` dead zone '' forms most summers in the Gulf of Mexico , caused by farm chemical run-off that flows down the Mississippi River . \nHydrocarbons in the crude oil from the BP spill actually stimulated the new microbes ' ability to degrade them in cold water , Hazen and his colleagues wrote in research published on Tuesday in the journal Science . \nIn part , Hazen said , this is because these new `` bugs '' have adjusted over millions of years to seek out any petroleum they can find at the depths where they live , which coincides with the depth of the previously observed plume , roughly 3000 feet . \nAt that depth , water temperature is approximately 41 degrees F -LRB- 5 degrees C -RRB- . \nLong before humans drilled for oil , natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico have put out the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill each year , Hazen said . \nAnother factor was the consistency of the oil that came from the Macondo wellhead : light sweet Louisiana crude , an easily digestible substance for bacteria , and it was dispersed into tiny droplets , which also makes it more biodegradable . \nThese latest findings may initially seem to be at odds with a study published last Thursday in Science by researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which confirmed the existence of the oil plume and said micro-organisms did not seem to be biodegrading it very quickly . \nHowever , Hazen and Rich Camilli of Woods Hole both said on Tuesday that the studies complement each other . \nThe Woods Hole team used an autonomous robot submarine and a mass spectrometer to detect the plume , but were forced to leave the area in late June , when Hurricane Alex threatened . \nAt that time , they figured the plume was likely to remain for some time . \nBut that was before the well was capped in mid-July . \nHazen said that within two weeks of the capping , the plume could not be detected , but there was a phenomenon called marine snow that indicated microbes had been feasting on hydrocarbons . \nAs of Tuesday , there was no sign of the plume , Hazen said . \nThat does n't mean there is no oil left from the 4.9 million barrels of crude that spilled into the Gulf after the April 20 blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig . \nThe U.S. government estimated on August 4 that 50 percent of the BP oil is gone from the Gulf and the rest is rapidly degrading . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWold be interesting to now what government agency , or corporate entity , involved Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . \nIf it was BP , or NOAA , what was once MMS , then this more than a little suspicious ! \nJust been WAY too much of `` do n't worry , it will be fine '' or `` do n't worry , the problem has already gone away , been solved , ...

'' \nAround 100 boats work out of Pass Christian , one of the busiest harbors on the Mississippi Gulf Coast . \nAs the Coast Guard and oil company BP Plc struggle to contain the slick from a blown-out well off Louisiana , states to the east were deploying fire-retardant booms and other measures to protect their coastlines . \nThe slick , five times bigger than first thought , threatens the eastern shores of Louisiana and could also affect coastal waters in Mississippi , Alabama and northwest Florida . \nThe Southern Shrimp Alliance told the National Marine Fisheries Service in Washington this week it could help with prevention and clean-up . \n`` They are willing to pull booms if they have to , '' said Deborah Long , a spokeswoman for the non-profit trade alliance . \n`` The timing of this could be horrible . '' \nU.S. landings of shrimp were valued at $ 442 million in 2008 , up 2 percent from the previous year , according to the National Marine Fisheries Service . \nBut the industry has been hammered by cheap imports and falling international prices , Long said . \nAt this time of year , shrimp head out to sea from inland estuaries where they spawn . \nThe industry fears a southerly wind could keep oil off the coast but push the shrimp into the slick , Long said . \nThe slick could also hit the tourism sector that is vital to Gulf Coast economies . \nIn Alabama , coastal residents and businesses were `` frantic '' about the possible impact if the slick was blown east , said George Crozier , director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , a state marine research facility . \nTourists spent $ 2.3 billion on Alabama 's beaches in 2008 , supporting 41,000 workers , according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau . \nBut Alabama 's beaches would be easier to clean than salt marshes and oyster reefs . \nCrozier said the state 's oyster fisheries are in `` immediate jeopardy . '' \n`` If they ca n't stop it and we wind up dealing with a flow of oil for three months , that carries us into hurricane season and all bets are off because it becomes a very significant ecological problem , '' he said . \nThe spill could also fracture a fragile relationship between Louisiana 's powerful energy lobby and environmental groups that say decades of exploration have hurt the coastline . \nCoastal Louisiana sits on the Mississippi Delta and environmentalists say inland oil and gas exploration and the building of pipelines and canals have eroded wetlands . \nThat loss exacerbated the storm surge in Louisiana that devastated New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and an oil spill will do further harm , said Steven Peyronnin , executive director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana . \n`` We have a catastrophe on our hands right now . \nThis is a moment to change policy , to really look at the risk we have undertaken here for a century and make changes , '' he said . \n`` The state 's greatest challenge is to find a way to harmonize safe , effective -LRB- oil and gas -RRB- production to maintain the state 's engine and to recognize the natural system as important to the state as well . '' \nBut restoring wetlands would cost big money . \nEstimates even before Katrina stood at $ 14 billion , Peyronnin said . \n"}

Wed Jul 7 , 2010 6:51 pm EDT ABU DHABI\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP boss Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on Wednesday , part of a quest for cash to ward off takeovers and help pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe action on Thursday was set to move back to the courts with the oil drilling industry going head-to-head with the Obama administration over the White House effort to suspend deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for six months in the wake of the catastrophic well blowout . \n-LRB- nN07171381 -RRB- Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was seen by Reuters with a senior official from another Abu Dhabi fund , and a report said Saudi investors were looking to buy 10 percent to 15 percent of the British oil company . \nA United Arab Emirates official said Hayward 's visit with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority -LRB- ADIA -RRB- was a routine one . \nAn ADIA spokesman declined comment . \n`` We are here to talk to our existing shareholders , '' a cheerful-looking Hayward told Reuters in the ornate , marble lobby of an Abu Dhabi office building before heading into a meeting , along with his six-man entourage . \nBut bankers say BP is on a marketing drive for its stock , whose price has fallen by half since its well blew out in April , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state . \nHayward was in Azerbaijan on Tuesday . \nBP 's shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed up almost 4 percent , buoyed by investor relief the company had said it does not plan to issue new equity , and speculation the worst is behind for what they see as an underpriced energy giant . \n`` With the CEO in Abu Dhabi speaking to the sovereign wealth fund to get some investment , it 's not surprising that there is some enthusiasm in the market for BP shares , '' said Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at London-based ETX Capital . \nProgress on the relief well , seen as the best hope for finally stopping the 79-day-old disaster , also lifted investor hearts . \nThe U.S. official overseeing the spill cleanup said it was 15 feet from the side of the leaking well , although still not expected to be finished before mid-August . \nThe spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and risking multibillion-dollar fishing and tourist industries at a time of high unemployment . \nAs a result , it sits atop U.S. President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and has sternly tested his leadership . \nOn Thursday , the next big round will play out in court in the fight between the drilling industry and the White House over its efforts to suspend offshore drilling . \nGiven the business and environmental stakes , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans is expected to rule quickly , after a rare one-hour oral argument , on whether deepwater drilling should be temporarily halted again . \nA federal judge , also in New Orleans , lifted the moratorium last month after Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc argued it was arbitrary because it was a blanket ban on all new drilling in depths below 500 feet . \nThe Obama administration appealed the decision , defending the suspension as needed to provide time to probe the BP oil spill 's cause and ensure other drilling rigs operate safely . \nThe administration is seeking a stay of the judge 's ruling at the hearing , slated for 3 p.m. local time -LRB- 2000 GMT -RRB- on Thursday . \nThe industry calls it an unnecessary infringement on its business that costs jobs . \nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said the ban will reduce crude output an average of 82,000 barrels per day , more than previously estimated . \nBP 's Alaska unit said on Wednesday it will probably delay until 2011 development drilling at its offshore Liberty field . \nIt had been due to start late this year . \nA successful court challenge `` could give some of these -LRB- drillers ' -RRB- stocks a lift in the near term , '' said Channing Smith , co-portfolio manager of Tulsa , Oklahoma-based Capital Advisors Growth Fund . \nThe Philadelphia oil services sector index is down about 25 percent from its 2010 high hit in late April . \nThe European Union 's energy chief said in Brussels that the bloc should consider its own moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling until after a probe into the BP spill . \nEstimates of the leak 's severity vary widely , to as high as 100,000 barrels per day . \nA new collection vessel that should more than double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 is projected to take three more days to hook up , as rough seas hamper efforts to finish the job . \nWith the region settling into the six-month hurricane season , forecasters were watching a weather system over the southern Gulf that could develop into a tropical depression and hit the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday . \nPushed by the Obama administration , BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the spill . \nIts costs to date have topped $ 3 billion . \nThe final bill may depend on how much crude pours from the well , which blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nSo containment efforts are keenly watched . \nBP executives have held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait , Qatar and Singapore , seeking a partner that might help it avoid being taken over , a UAE source said . \nAbu Dhabi 's International Petroleum Investment Company , was not interested in buying a BP stake , a company source said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe first target is to concentrate power to close that oil hole far 1500 meters from surface ships . \nWhat is happening seems a slow rallenty of eleven september2001 tragedy . \nI 'm crying every hour with my child -LRB- five years -RRB- for what is happening in Louisiana . \nI tried to communicate in every manner my technical ideas to somebody who wants really stop the leak . \ni tried to send emails with drawings of plug with steel plate crown around TO horizon support ... coast guard ... @uscg . \nmil ; and horizon support , The first reason of this accident should be bad maintainance of systems and eccessive pressures than preventived , then no gas tight and electrical problems ... . \nit is not thje first time . \nBut I am quite sure that the real criminal act of BP is their intention to continue to collect oil instead to stop it definitely and then drill again . \n... But as now we can program the positive act to close the leak completely : It is easy to be closed when the bottom area around this hole is free from interference objects : solution is to clean the area with the power of us coast guards and us navy . \nThe removal of all piping interferences and strange inventions to have an horizontal and clean area around the hole . \nThe column of water above this hole is 150 atm of pressure and can be used on a crown steel horizontal plate welded around a below positioned plug . \nThe pressure of water is on a steel larger area pushing on the bottom around the hole and the pressure from gas\\/oil is on the plug only . \nLike a cap `` sombrero '' . \nThis is enough to close this hole . \nWhithout losses of money and energies of great men who are fighting against effects of the oil invasion . \nPlease understand this simple concept which is not be taken in consideration enough . \nI am still confused if the pressure of oil coming out from the hole is more than 100 psi and the blow up was due to the pressure how then drilling a relief hole can be safeguarded so that we do not have another problem like the earlier one . \nCan someone kindly explain Jul 07 , 2010 6:50 am EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1972", "time": "2010-04-27", "text": "Crisis control is an art , as BP knows all too well . \nThe UK oil and gas major is sparing nothing in dealing with the fatal explosion on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig . \nTony Hayward , the chief executive , has deployed 32 ships , two rigs , five airplanes and over 1,000 people . \nThat may seem excessive for a relatively small spill , estimated at 1,000 barrels a day , but too much is better than too little . \nMr. Hayward is clearly worried about BP 's reputation , which had been badly damaged when he took the job three years ago . \nIn both a 2005 explosion in the company s Texas City refinery and problems in an Alaskan pipeline , BP was directly responsible and partly at fault . \nThis case looks different : the rig was operated by Swiss contractor Transocean and the problem appears to have been technical , the failure of a key piece of equipment , the blowout preventer . \nBut even if this accident was extremely bad luck -- the blowout preventer is supposed to be fool-proof -- BP designed the project and is ultimately responsible for the clean-up . \nThat might take months and cost as much as $ 200 million , including the expense of drilling a relief well . \nIn addition , there could be lawsuits . \nInvestors seem to see even worse damages . \nThey have wiped more than 6 billion pounds the company 's market capitalization since the spill , despite strong quarterly results . \nA big worry is that the spill provokes a public backlash on deep sea drilling , which is the new frontier in oil and gas exploration . \nIt is hard enough to contain an oil spill on land , but it is much harder depths of 5,000 feet . \nThere are n't any precedents for this kind of spill at those depths . \nThe explosion gives ammunition to anti-oil environmentalists , just when President Barack Obama is considering expanding offshore drilling . \nThe desire to prevent a political explosion helps explain BP 's aggressive response . \nMr. Hayward may have cleaned up company 's deeper problems , but he stills needs maximal damage limitation , for the sake of BP and the whole industry . \nThat requires is a swift clean-up , and no more freak accidents . \nIt amazes me to see how disjointed the oil industry is when needing to get their message out , whether it 's to explain issues around exploration and production or address catastrophes like the fire and spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThey all still communicate like it 's the 1950s and it 's almost always in crisis mode . \nMaybe some day they 'll learn that by providing facts about E&P and addressing the potential issues , costs , benefits , dangers ... they 'll be able to put a better message out about why these events , even though disastrous , are so rare and how they constantly work for a safer working environment and a smaller environmental footprint . \nTheir lack of understanding when it comes to communications leaves them wide open for criticism at times like these . \nWhy have BP and Transocean not been out front to mobilize employees and volunteers to assist along the coastlines and sensitive environmental areas ? \nHave they held any public meetings in the coastal communities ? \nYes , they are focusing on trying to stop the flow of oil but they 're big boys and they can do more than one thing at a time , especially when it comes to the environment they want to operate in . \nIf we are going to explore in water we need to have foolproof methods of controlling mishaps . \nThey are saying this spill is up to 5,000 barrels a day and it could take 90 days to stop the flow ! \nThe damage it may cause in environmentally sensitive areas of Louisiana and over to Florida is n't easily contained or cleaned up ! \nI think they will get the clean up done and minimize damage . \nI think the fact that it is in a warm water area makes it easier . \nIt takes time to figure out exactly how to fix the problem and clean up is a matter of getting enough equipment there to get it cleaned up . \nPlease also do not forget that a pipeline owned by a BP subsidiary exploded near Bellingham , WA in 1999 and killed 3 people . \nIt could have been even worse than it was . \nThe subsidiary was found at fault . \nBP appears to have a systemic problem with managing and mitigating risk . \nToday 's article in the Wall Street Journal -LRB- 4-29-2010 -RRB- summed up the problem here in the US . \nApparently Norway and Brazil require the use of an acoustic switch on the blow out preventer valve in addition to the cable from the control room on the drilling rig . \nThe acoustic switch which can be activated remotely as a back up system to close the valve . \nIt costs about $ 500,000 which is about 0.10 % of the cost of the drilling rig that was lost and about 2 hours worth of clean-up reported to currently be $ 6,000,000 per day . \nMy 13 year old grand daughter read the WSJ article and said `` It was a poor decision not to have the acoustic switch installed to shut off the blowout valve on the rig '' . \nI wonder why the US Mineral Management engineers could not come to the same conclusion ? \nCould it be the decisions in all US Government Agencies are made by industry lobbyists based on saving a few dollars and are not based on good engineering practices to protect life , property and the environment ?

'' \nYet sources close to the company said if BP ditched Hayward before the well was capped and significant progress made on the cleanup , his successor could also tarred by the spill fallout . \nApart from the oil spill , BP 's core business is booming . \nLast month , refining boss Iain Conn , who was effectively running BP while Hayward was overseeing the oil spill response , said core operations were running `` very effectively . '' \nIt was a typically understated comment from the Scotsman and a Reuters poll of 11 analysts gave an average forecast of $ 4.98 billion for BP 's underlying net profits , a 77 percent rise on the same period last year . \nHigher oil and gas prices and stronger refining margins are expected to boost all the big oil companies , but analysts at Citigroup said BP 's predicted result `` represents the strongest momentum in the peer group . '' \nThe London-based company is also expected to brave a another potential public relations quagmire by revealing it will offset its spill-related costs against tax . \n`` If you make lower profits , you should pay lower taxes , '' one source said close to the company said . \n"}

'' \n`` She had the proper documentation so we paid her , but you have to wonder . '' \nAnother applicant was overheard telling fellow claimants in the waiting room she was a stripper on New Orleans ' famed Bourbon Street , said Burnell Alessi , the office 's manager . \n`` Every time we think we 've seen it all , there 's a new one that comes in , '' Alessi said . \nBP has so far paid $ 201 million out of its $ 20 billion fund to residents and businesses in Gulf Coast states . \nFishermen and shrimpers have received $ 50 million of that pie . \nBut of the 114,000 claims submitted , nearly 54 percent , or more than 61,000 , lack key documentation , according to BP . \nAlthough many fishermen , shrimpers , oystermen and others have complained of red tape , BP says it is working diligently to quickly process and pay claims . \nThe process has been flexible to allow for unforeseen issues , like claimants without their paperwork in perfect order , but that may have opened the door to fraud . \n`` We are trying to have a process that is workable that addresses genuine need , '' said BP 's government and public affairs director , Ron Rybarczyk . \n`` It was not a perfect system . \nWe erred on the side of ... putting it in motion before we examined every angle . '' \nThere are 36 claims offices throughout the Gulf states . \nIn early August , the claims process will transfer from BP to Kenneth Feinberg , a high-powered attorney tasked by President Obama to oversee the damage claims process . \nSpeaking recently at a town hall meeting in Houma , Louisiana , Feinberg stressed his willingness to pay legitimate claimants who might not have perfect documentation . \n`` Tell the captain of your boat or your priest or your sheriff or your mayor , come on in and vouch for you , '' he said . \n`` I have to get something to avoid fraud , to verify your claim , but I 'm not looking to get fancy here , '' Feinberg said . \n`` I 'm looking to get the money out to people who need it . \nI 'm working for you . \nLet 's get creative on corroboration . \nI will then bend over backwards . '' \nBut that willingness to pay has opened the door to trouble , locals say . \n`` You see people who have n't been down here in 20 years showing up at that claims office , '' said shrimper Marvin Davis , who reported one out-of-towner trying to game the system . \nIn one scam making the circuit , boat captains vouch for purported out-of-work deckhands who then share with the captains a cut of their BP payment . \nAdjusters are now wise to the scheme , using a boat registration number that can show whether a boat with a capacity for four workers , for example , has a phantom crew of double that number -- all seeking funds . \nApplications for Louisiana commercial fishing licenses also reveal potential schemes in motion . \nThe department of wildlife and fisheries processed applications for 85 such licenses on April 9th , about a week before the spill . \nA month later , that number rose 44 percent to 122 applications , following the news that BP would pay claims to fishermen with active licenses . \n`` Why would you need a commercial fishing license when you know the fishing is closed ?

{"id": "908", "time": "2010-07-13", "text": "OSLO | Tue Jul 13 , 2010 10:28 am EDT OSLO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Some marine life thrives on oil bubbling up naturally from the seabed even though it can not cope with giant single leaks like from BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico , experts say . \nNatural seeps from thousands of spots from the Pacific Ocean to the North Sea account for about 45 percent of all oil entering the oceans in a typical year , according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences . \nThe rest is from leaks caused by people . \nThe little-understood seeps show that the oceans can absorb what is normally viewed as harmful pollution -- a host of microbes can eat oil and gas , especially light compounds such as gasoline , while finding thicker tars indigestible . \n`` You can sometimes see oil from seeps as slicks on the surface , '' said Arne Jernelov of the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm , who led a U.N. environmental study of a huge blowout on the Mexican Ixtoc 1 rig in 1979 . \n`` But a large concentrated spill is a totally different thing ... Nature can not adapt , '' he said of BP 's 85-day spill . \nApart from being eaten by bacteria , oil can evaporate and is broken down by sunlight . \nEnvironmentalists say that the existence of seeps should not be a backdoor justification for dumping oil in the seas that can kill creatures from turtles to pelicans . \n`` While these seeps can release large amounts of oil , the rate is usually very slow , which allows the surrounding ecosystems to adapt , '' environmental group Oceana said in a report . \nOther species are unable to adapt and die . \nJernelov estimates BP 's leak , the worst in U.S. history , at 250,000 to 400,000 tonnes by early this month , compared with 140,000 tonnes leaking naturally every year from seeps in the seabed in the Gulf of Mexico alone . \nOn land , one of the biggest natural oil ponds is Trinidad 's Pitch Lake -- English mariner Walter Raleigh used its pitch to caulk his ship in 1595 . \nOn the seabed , seeps are often hard to locate , are intermittent and seem to seal themselves . \nSome oil companies use the presence of seeps as a guide to exploration . \nOil from each deposit has a distinct chemical makeup . \n`` We 've seen about 1 percent of the sea floor . \nWhen you start finding oil floating around you think it 's from a tanker . \nBut a significant amount comes from below , '' said Martin Hovland , an expert on seeps at the University of Bergen in Norway . \nHe said late Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl was probably wrong to blame human pollution for oil spotted in mid-Atlantic from his Ra raft in 1969 and 1970 . \nThe oil , some encrusted with barnacles and algae , may well have been from a natural seep . \nAnd Hovland said seeps might be far more important in the food chain than believed , perhaps drawing humpback whales to the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California where thick mats of bacteria and other organisms carpet the seabed near seeps . \nSeeps might also explain why the North Sea , rich in oil and gas , has more fish than the nearby Irish Sea , he said . \nThe latest U.S. National Academy of Sciences estimates , in a 2003 study , say seeps account for 600,000 tonnes of oil out of a total 1.3 million tonnes entering the oceans yearly . \nLeaks from human production , transport and consumption account for about 700,000 tonnes a year . \n"}

\nMaybe BP got complacent in the U.S. , given the lack of scrutiny from regulators or anyone else ? \nWhile the projects I worked on were in new markets that were lucrative but gnarly , eliciting concern from investors , campaigners , and the company itself , perhaps they were much more marginalized than I realized . \nWe need to demand that companies calculate risks not just for their bottom line , but for society at large -- recognizing that in the long run the two are often the same . \nWe need scrutiny of those calculations from all parts of society -- not just by lawmakers and regulators -LRB- although that would be a good place to start -RRB- , but by pension funds , neighbors and the media . \nWe need to understand what motivates companies , for better and for worse . \nAs those at Davos discuss how to create a more sustainable future , we should study not just what BP did wrong , but also what it tried to get right . \nPhotos , Top : A copy of the report by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling in Washington January 11 , 2011 . \nREUTERS\\/Kevin Lamarque Bottom : The damaged blowout preventer from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is extracted from the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 , 2010 . \nREUTERS\\/Petty Officer 1st Class Thomas Blue\\/U . \nBut it is a chancy proposition for global mega-corporations , competing in their own gigantic arenas , to place societies ' interests ahead of their own essential profit motives , without intelligent , agile public regulation that seeks to maximize both goals . \nAbove all , people need to pay close and more sophisticated attention to how business is conducted at these levels . \nYour op-ed is a great example ... thanks ! \nYour statement supports the behavior taken by BP in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska . \n`` Maybe BP got complacent in the U.S. , given the lack of scrutiny from regulators or anyone else ?

Sloan Foundation . \n`` There are three species out there to be discovered for every one we know . '' \nThe census itself found more than 6,000 potentially new species , led in numbers by crustaceans and molluscs , and made formal descriptions of more than 1,200 of them . \nAmong extremes , scientists found a meter-long tube worm an estimated 600 years old , tracked a sooty shearwater bird flying 64,000 km -LRB- 40,000 miles -RRB- in the longest known annual migration and recorded a sailfish swimming at 110 kph -LRB- 69 mph -RRB- . \nAmong spinoffs , a 2009 review of the Gulf of Mexico found 8,332 species from fish to mammals in the area hit by BP 's deep water blowout in April 2010 , the worst spill in U.S. history . \n`` It 's become one of the most valuable potential contributions of the census , '' Ausubel said of the Gulf survey . \nChecking the state of the Gulf against the public database would help understand damage -- and costs of BP 's cleanup . \nTwo members of a five-strong commission named by U.S. President Barack Obama to investigate the spill - Terry Garcia and Donald Boesch -- had worked on the census . \nIn the longer term , monitoring the seas may help understand threats such as climate change and a related acidification of the oceans . \nExamination of the makeup of some of the creatures and plants might yield medical breakthroughs . \nA related project had created a `` barcode of life , '' inspired by the black and white lines on products in supermarkets , that allows scientists to identify species with a quick genetic test . \nThat has already exposed mislabeling of sushi in New York City and could have wide economic impact in tracking fraud in fish exports . \nAnd the scientists said the census had successfully focused public attention on the beauty and variety of marine life and could help rally efforts to safeguard the seas . \nArtists have been inspired by some creatures -- images of the yeti crab , found off Easter Island , has even been emblazoned on skateboards , Snelgrove said . \n`` These critters are tremendous ambassadors for us , '' he added . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \n`` Neither this nor any investigation should be used as political justification for a pre-determined agenda to limit affordable energy options for America , '' Upton said in a statement . \nOil companies have voiced concerns that onerous new regulations could hamper offshore exploration and drive up oil prices . \nU.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production fell by 70,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter of 2010 , with further drops expected this year and in 2012 . \nBut Reilly said it was time for Congress `` to exercise serious oversight '' in a regime that has not kept pace with the industry 's push into deeper and deeper waters . \nAs a first step , he demanded that Congress provide the funding to hire additional government inspectors for drilling operations . \nFollowing the BP accident , the Interior Department restructured the agency responsible for overseeing drilling and has instituted a raft of new safety rules . \n`` We have already implemented several of the key reforms the commission has made clear are necessary , and we will use the commission 's report and the findings of other investigations to inform future actions to strengthen safety and oversight , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement . \nThe seven-member commission also pushed for the oil industry to create a self-regulating entity to help enforce standards and called on Congress to raise liability limits on offshore drilling operators . \nModeled on the nuclear industry 's Institute of Nuclear Power Operations , a self-regulatory group would allow offshore drillers to hold their counterparts more accountable , the commission said in its final report . \nWhile not calling for a halt to drilling in the Arctic , the commission said there is need for more study of the intense physical conditions and Interior should ensure that companies have adequate plans and resources to handle a spill there . \nThe commission was created by President Barack Obama after an April 20 explosion ruptured BP 's underwater Macondo well , killing 11 workers in the Gulf of Mexico and leading to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe commission is the first government-sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the BP accident . \nIts report contains few surprises , as it mirrors many statements and reports released by the panel over the past six months . \nAlthough the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies , its findings could influence future court proceedings and energy policy . \nPaul Sankey , an analyst with Deutsche Bank Oil , said he thinks U.S. offshore activity will be lower in the aftermath of the spill . \n`` The broadness of these recommendations and lack of specifics will delay activity , '' Sankey said . \nStill , despite these concerns from the industry , Chevron Corp greenlit plans to invest nearly $ 12 billion in two major deepwater Gulf projects late last year . \nThe American Petroleum Institute criticized the panel 's report for casting doubt on the entire oil industry based on a single accident . \n`` This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety , '' said API Upstream Director Erik Milito . \nThe PHLX oil service index jumped 2.3 percent on Tuesday , outperforming the tepid gains of 0.5 percent in the broader S&P 500 index . \nThe sector , which has largely been on a climb since early September , is nearing the highest point since September 2008 . \nCameron International Corp , which made the blowout preventer on the BP well , drove the equipment sector index higher with gains of more than 4 percent in afternoon trading . \nBP added nearly 3 percent , while Halliburton gained 3.2 percent and Transocean rose 2.3 percent . \n-LRB- Additional Reporting by Timothy Gardner ; Editing by Russell Blinch and Lisa Shumaker -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n`` There is ... a profound problem with federal government limits on liability . \nThat is central planning gone mad . \nThe liability for environmental damage should be 100 % at least . \nSuch a system would match a company 's policies to the actual risk of doing damage . \nLower limits would inspire companies to be less concerned about damage to others than they should be , in the same way that a company with a bailout guarantee faces a moral hazard to be less efficient than it would be in a free market .

{"id": "266", "time": "2011-01-11", "text": "The great thing about presidential commissions is that they can soberly consider complicated matters and then offer unvarnished reports on what to do . \nThe tough part is when that information rockets around Washington , as occurred after a White House commission issued its final report on the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe `` Deep Water '' report , apparently titled in reference to the doomed BP Deepwater Horizon rig , blames the deadly blowout and oil spill on government and industry complacency , and recommends more regulation of offshore drilling and a new independent safety agency . \nBut as my colleague Ayesha Rascoe reports , the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies . \nWithin minutes of the report 's release , and even as commission co-chair William Reilly was bragging about bringing the report in on time and under budget , interest groups started the PR barrage , with industry critical and environmental outfits largely complimentary . \nTwo Democratic members of Congress said they 'd introduce legislation to implement the commission 's recommendations . \nWill that legislation go anywhere ? \nIndustry analysts are doubtful . \nTo get an idea of how much action can be prompted by White House panels , it 's useful to take a look at two previous ones . \nThe 911 Commission -LRB- formally called `` The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States '' -RRB- was perhaps the ultimate in gracefully delivering its hard findings : `` ... on that September day we were unprepared . \nWe did not grasp the magnitude of a threat that had been gathering over time . \nAs we detail in our report , this was a failure of policy , management , capability , and above all a failure of imagination .

'' \nThe claims process will transition from BP 's control to become the new `` Gulf Coast-Feinberg '' program within 20 days , and soon applicants will be able to file claims online after complaints by many affected by the leak that the process is often cumbersome , requiring stacks of paperwork and several visits to claims centers . \nJun 22 , 2010 13:39 UTC Shakespeare definitely put it best , in that famous balcony scene from `` Romeo and Juliet '' : `` What 's in a name ? \nThat which we call a rose , by any other name would smell as sweet .

{"id": "1469", "time": "2011-01-11", "text": "The great thing about presidential commissions is that they can soberly consider complicated matters and then offer unvarnished reports on what to do . \nThe tough part is when that information rockets around Washington , as occurred after a White House commission issued its final report on the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe `` Deep Water '' report , apparently titled in reference to the doomed BP Deepwater Horizon rig , blames the deadly blowout and oil spill on government and industry complacency , and recommends more regulation of offshore drilling and a new independent safety agency . \nBut as my colleague Ayesha Rascoe reports , the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies . \nWithin minutes of the report 's release , and even as commission co-chair William Reilly was bragging about bringing the report in on time and under budget , interest groups started the PR barrage , with industry critical and environmental outfits largely complimentary . \nTwo Democratic members of Congress said they 'd introduce legislation to implement the commission 's recommendations . \nWill that legislation go anywhere ? \nIndustry analysts are doubtful . \nTo get an idea of how much action can be prompted by White House panels , it 's useful to take a look at two previous ones . \nThe 911 Commission -LRB- formally called `` The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States '' -RRB- was perhaps the ultimate in gracefully delivering its hard findings : `` ... on that September day we were unprepared . \nWe did not grasp the magnitude of a threat that had been gathering over time . \nAs we detail in our report , this was a failure of policy , management , capability , and above all a failure of imagination .

{"id": "425", "time": "2010-08-06", "text": "Gulf oil well seal holding , BP looks to final kill HOUSTON | Fri Aug 6 , 2010 5:50 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP said on Friday the cement seal on its crippled Gulf of Mexico oil well was holding and a relief well to permanently plug the ill-fated borehole was on track to reach its target in mid-August . \nAs the final stages of the long-awaited `` kill '' operation moved forward , nagging questions remained about the lasting environmental and economic impact to the U.S. Gulf region from the world 's worst offshore oil accident . \nMore than 100 days after the start of the catastrophic spill that ravaged ecologically sensitive wetlands and lucrative coastal economies , BP said no oil was leaking from the undersea Macondo well and no `` recoverable oil '' was left on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP finished pumping cement on Thursday into the ruptured well one mile below the surface after injections of drilling mud earlier this week subdued the pressure of oil and gas . \nThe wellhead was provisionally capped in mid-July . \nThe so-called `` static kill '' at the top of the well is due to be finished off with a `` bottom kill '' later in August with more mud and cement injected through a relief bore that will be drilled into the well shaft . \nThis relief well is regarded as the final solution to plug the reservoir 13,000 feet beneath the seabed . \nBP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , Doug Suttles , told reporters at a briefing the cement job `` appears to be performing as expected . '' \n`` All of the indications so far look very encouraging , '' he said in New Orleans . \nEngineers were pressure-testing the injected cement . \nRetired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who heads the oil spill response for President Barack Obama 's administration , said the relief well was scheduled to reach the well shaft below the seabed `` somewhere between August 14th and 15th . '' \n`` We are unequivocally committed to completing the relief wells , '' Allen said in a conference call . \nA second , back-up relief well is also being drilled . \nAsked if BP would sell its rights to the Macondo field , Suttles replied : `` We just have n't thought about that . '' \n`` Clearly there is lots of oil and gas here and we will have to think about what to do with that at some point , '' he said . \nThe well 's sealing was a relief for both the British energy giant , whose shares and image have taken a beating from the spill , and for Obama 's administration , which has faced criticism over its response and has pledged to help the pollution-struck Gulf Coast recover . \nBP shares , which have recovered strongly since hitting a 14-year low on June 25 , appeared once again to be buoyed by the news of the progress in plugging the well . \nThey rose more than 2 percent in early London trading before falling back to close up 0.46 percent . \nIn New York , BP shares were up 1.7 percent in late-day trading . \nSuttles , who had led BP 's overall oil spill response in the Gulf but was now returning to his chief operating officer role in Houston , nevertheless acknowledged the coastal cleanup effort was `` far from finished . '' \n`` Clearly we feel like its moving to a new phase because we 've been three weeks without new oil flowing into the sea , and we do n't have oil out on the open water anymore . \nBut we still have a lot of work around the shoreline , '' he said . \nMike Utsler was appointed to take his place in BP 's Gulf spill response operation . \nThe company has lost over a third of its market value since the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers , sank the Deepwater Horizon rig and triggered the spill . \nQuestions remain about the final total of the cleanup bill and the damage liabilities and possible fines BP will face . \n`` If chapter one of BP 's corporate nightmare took place largely under sea in the battle to plug the leak , the next chapter in this odyssey is likely to play out in courtrooms and law offices , '' IHS Energy analyst Andrew Neff wrote in a briefing note . \nBP , which already agreed to a $ 20 billion escrow fund to guarantee cover of economic damage claims , has said it would sell about $ 30 billion in assets to address the costs related to the spill , and this asset selling process has started . \n`` More assets are expected to be up for grabs as BP shrinks itself to steel the company for a vastly different future than it envisioned back in April , when the firm was reportedly days away from announcing a massive oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Neff added . \nMany Gulf Coast residents have seen their fishing and tourism livelihoods devastated by the spill . \nThey and some scientists have expressed skepticism about the government 's assertion this week that around 75 percent of the estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked by the well had either evaporated , dispersed or otherwise been contained . \nCarol Browner , Obama 's energy and climate change adviser , on Friday defended the government declaration . \n`` No one is trying to oversell or undersell anything , '' she told a community forum in St. Petersburg , Florida , where local business owners said even the threat of oil washing ashore had been enough to dent their income . \nThere was no actual oil impact on the St. Petersburg part of the Florida coastline . \nBP was working to produce a Gulf Coast recovery masterplan within six months and hoped to get support for it from federal , state and local government , according to James Lee Witt , a former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and now a crisis management consultant , who has been contracted by BP . \nMichael Hirshfield , chief scientist with the ocean conservation advocacy group Oceana , said it could be years before experts fully understood the spill 's effects on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem , or on species like the Atlantic bluefin tuna , which spawns in these waters . \n`` It 's like trying to prove a negative . \nYou have to wait longer for the absence of something , '' he said , as the group prepared to embark on a two-month trip to assess long-term impacts on coral , fish , sharks and other marine life . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI suspected they would do this , and is it a rather standard compression procedure to assure everything fits into any possible leaks -LRB- such as the annulus -RRB- and the layers of mud , cement , and rock are tightened up . \nAlso it allows the cement sets up quickly . \nThe cement will be quite strong tomorrow and the well may then be officially declared DEAD . \nI can tell from what I know about oil and gas wells , that this was a success and this well can even NOW be declared totally dead . \nTomorrow , they can start removing the BOP to bring it to the surface . \nThen they will examine it to see what caused the Macondo well failure . \nThey will then know if the problems in the recent past found in the other BOPs of the two relief wells are the very same type problems that caused the Macondo blow out -LRB- due to its BOP problem -RRB- . \nI suspect there will then be a very clear understanding of this entire problem . \nBP officials have in recent days hedged about committing to pumping cement down the relief well , saying only that the relief well will be used in some fashion . \nThey may opt to just use the well simply to test whether the reservoir is plugged by checking only the annulus . \nThis is good news , as that procedure will not open into the O&G of the Monster Formation again -- to test the BOP of the relief well -- and allow another blow out up through the faulty BOP the relief well is using . \nI think Admiral Allen will come to realize that only checking the annulus using the relief well will be a total and complete scientific proof that the present bullhead kill did the KILL job . \nHopefully he will be advised by people who understand the O&G science and not by scientists who are trying to learn . \nBeing an old retired O&G man , I know this uneventful procedure had all the necessary parts that are needed to completely seal all the problems . \nIt had the heavy mud , followed by cement then followed by a squeeze job -LRB- that I mentioned in earlier posts should be used -RRB- to forever seal this well . \nIn other words , they did it right , and the well is forever DEAD . \nUnless of course they drill into the Monster Zone again . \nBP s Senior Vice President Kent Wells most likely will explain this to Admiral Allen . \nThen hopefully Allen will agree that to save face , they still use the relief well but only to check the annulus -LRB- without re-opening the Monster Zone -RRB- to then confirm what Kent Wells already knows -LRB- like I do -RRB- . \nI am glad this sad event is over and hope with a little forethought , and Monday Morning Quarterbacking , that both the Government and the Oil and Gas industry will learn to avoid such events . \nI personally think that preparedness for events is the best insurance -- and that includes quick cappable BOPs -LRB- in case they fail -- such as the type I suggested to the offshore O&G Governing Agency . \nOnly if Allen says Reopen it . \nHowever there will still be some illogical people that think Zombies and Phoenix Birds are real and imagine they might rise again from their graves -RRB- . \nIt is easy to demonize BP for this whole mess , but frankly , compared to most companies I am familiar with , BP even if they bear some responsibility for the initial event , which is still not clear to me , have behaved in a very responsible and proactive manner during the course of this spill . \nOne thing that needs to be carefully examined in this whole incident is the actions of the firefighting boats that were involved in extinguishing the original fire . \nIt appears now that they may have played a significant role in the actual collapse of the rig by the way they sprayed water onto the rig to fight the fire , which apparently may have been the factor that caused the rig to eventually collapse . \nThese last two comment are really lame ... if that is all you expect than you deserve the lame response we were given . \nIf you are to believe the threat of terrorism than the obvious targets should be all the deep sea wells . \nObviously there is a huge weak link between The United States coastline , the business that goes in and out of our harbors everyday and these oil wells . \nDuh ... yeah this response from Obama and BP are acceptable . \nIt is a sad commentary on you if you are patriotic citizens of the U.S. . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform

's bought Amoco in 1998 and many current BP distributors used to be Amoco distributors . \n`` Yes , the Amoco question comes up in conversation -- driven by the goal of distributors to recapture fuels leadership in terms of quality , performance and sales , '' said Kleine said in an e-mail . \nKleine added later in a telephone interview , however , that he has heard of no distributors changing the name of their operations from BP to Amoco . \n`` There is not rebranding to Amoco for sure , because that is a trademark name owned by BP , '' he said from Savannah , Georgia . \n`` With regard to rebranding from BP to another brand , I do n't know of a move under way for that to happen .

{"id": "666", "time": "2010-07-15", "text": "BP says test shuts off oil leak from Gulf well HOUSTON | Thu Jul 15 , 2010 7:36 pm EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said on Thursday no oil was leaking into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since its huge spill began in April as it conducted pressure tests on its blown-out deep-sea well . \nFor the test , BP closed valves and vents on a tight-sealing containment cap installed atop its ruptured well earlier this week . \nInitial results early in the test showed the cap had completely contained the flow of oil , BP said . \n`` It 's a great sight but it 's far from the finish line , '' Doug Suttles , a senior BP executive , told reporters . \nBP 's U.S. shares initially jumped 10 percent after the company announced that its test had shut off the flow of oil . \nPresident Barack Obama called the end of the flow of oil into the ocean a `` positive sign , '' but cautioned that the latest effort was still in the testing phase . \nThe spill has caused an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nAs the company pushed ahead on the spill-control effort , U.S. energy company Apache Corp was moving forward on a possible $ 10 billion deal for some BP properties , including major assets in Alaska , CNBC reported . \nAfter a delay to fix a leak , BP began the test on Thursday afternoon on the cap that could stop all or most of the flow of crude that has been polluting the ocean and coastline since April 20 in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe test , which could last between six to 48 hours , gauges pressure in the well -- which extends 2.5 miles under the seabed -- to assess its condition . \nOfficials said it will show whether the cap can safely shut off the flow from the well if oil-capture vessels at the surface must disconnect . \nThe U.S. Coast Guard has described the containment cap as at best a temporary fix to the leak while BP finishes two relief wells that it is drilling that are intended to intersect the blown-out well and permanently seal it next month . \nThe test is intended to determine whether the structure of the lengthy well is damaged or intact . \nRetired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the U.S. government 's point man on the spill , compared the test to placing one 's thumb over the end of a garden hose -- if the pressure does not increase that means there is a leak somewhere . \nRegarding the BP well , a build-up of pressure would signal that the well is intact , which would make it easier to seal it with the relief wells . \nThe cap is a crucial step toward a multi-vessel oil-capture system that is hurricane-ready and can collect up to 80,000 barrels -LRB- 3.34 million gallons\\/12 .7 million liters -RRB- per day . \nThat should be more than enough to capture the whole well output , as estimates put the spill rate between 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- a day . \nAllen backed away from earlier assurances that the new cap would be used to completely seal the well until the relief wells eventually kill it with heavy mud and cement . \nAllen said the cap could shut the well , but might be used only to block the flow during emergency situations like a hurricane when BP 's surface containment effort would be suspended . \n`` The intention of the capping stack was never to close in the well per se , '' Allen said in New Orleans . \nReports that Apache was seeking $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion for the purchase helped boost BP 's U.S. shares from midday . \nThe shares then rose further on the initial test results and ended up 7.6 percent at $ 38.92 . \n`` It 's been one of those headline things we 've heard for 87 days , lots of people waiting for some good news , '' said John Massey , portfolio manager at Sunamerica Asset Management in Jersey City , New Jersey . \nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters Insider predict that BP will spend between $ 63 billion to $ 100 billion over the next 15 years in fines , cleanup costs and legal costs . \nBP 's shares have been ravaged since the well rupture , with $ 100 billion in market value being knocked off at one stage , before a three-week rally sparked by takeover talk , speculation about investment by a sovereign wealth fund and hopes that the well would be capped . \nThe news that it had finally stopped the leak -- at least during the test -- was a bit of good news for the British company , which has seen its share value plummet and reputation battered since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the spill of millions of gallons of oil . \nBP also faced new measures in the U.S. Congress . \nLawmakers are mulling a range of new laws that could require tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . \nThe U.S. government , which has vowed to make BP pay for fixing the well and all cleanup efforts , told the oil giant that it was responsible for paying all royalties on the oil it is collecting from the ruptured well . \nCurrently , energy companies pay the government a royalty rate of up to 18.75 percent of the value of the oil and gas drilled in offshore tracts . \nThrough its containment systems , BP has collected or burned more than 800,000 barrels of oil . \nThe Gulf spill has soiled hundreds of miles\\/kilometers of shoreline , shut down about a third of Gulf fisheries and hurt tourism and fishing in all five U.S. Gulf states . \nIt has also created problems for Obama as the government works to respond to the crisis while area residents struggle financially . \n`` It 's a great thing , it 's a wonderful thing , '' said Jerome DeGree in Larose , Louisiana when he heard that BP had at least temporarily stopped the oil from gushing into the ocean . \n`` This has been hurting this whole area , '' the shallow-water oil

'' \nReports that Apache was seeking $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion for the purchase helped boost BP 's U.S. shares from midday . \nThe shares then rose further on the initial test results and ended up 7.6 percent at $ 38.92 . \n`` It 's been one of those headline things we 've heard for 87 days , lots of people waiting for some good news , '' said John Massey , portfolio manager at Sunamerica Asset Management in Jersey City , New Jersey . \nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters Insider predict that BP will spend between $ 63 billion to $ 100 billion over the next 15 years in fines , cleanup costs and legal costs . \nBP 's shares have been ravaged since the well rupture , with $ 100 billion in market value being knocked off at one stage , before a three-week rally sparked by takeover talk , speculation about investment by a sovereign wealth fund and hopes that the well would be capped . \nThe news that BP had finally stopped the leak -- at least during the test -- was a bit of good news for the British company , which has seen its share value plummet and reputation battered since the April rig explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the spill of millions of gallons of oil . \nBP also faced new measures in the U.S. Congress . \nLawmakers are mulling a range of new laws that could require tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . \n-LRB- ID : nN15210454 -RRB- The U.S. government , which has vowed to make BP pay for fixing the well and all cleanup efforts , told the oil giant that it was responsible for paying all royalties on the oil it is collecting from the ruptured well . \n-LRB- ID : nN15220646 -RRB- Currently , energy companies pay the government a royalty rate of up to 18.75 percent of the value of the oil and gas drilled in offshore tracts . \nThrough its containment systems , BP has collected or burned more than 800,000 barrels of oil . \nThe Gulf spill has soiled hundreds of miles -LRB- km -RRB- of shoreline , shut down about a third of Gulf fisheries and hurt tourism and fishing in all five U.S. Gulf states . \nIt has also created problems for Obama as the government works to respond to the crisis while area residents struggle financially . \nIn an issue unrelated to the spill , but illustrating the pressure BP faces in the United States , the company confirmed on Thursday that it had lobbied the British government to speed up a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya in late 2007 . \n-LRB- For a fact box on BP in Libya , see -LRB- ID : nLDE66E0ZO -RRB- -RRB- In August 2009 , Britain released a Libyan convicted of blowing up a U.S. plane , angering the United States . \nMany of the 270 dead in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing were American . \n-LRB- ID : nWLA8411 -RRB- The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it would hold a hearing on the issue on July 29 . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHopefully it is much more !!

'' \n`` You are recommending a whole new level of bureaucracy on top of an obviously already failed bureaucracy with the obvious aim of indefinitely delaying of the production of our nation 's energy reserves , '' McClintock said . \nCommission co-chair Reilly disputed these claims . \n`` The degree to which we add anything it is intended to provide more capability , more expertise ... facilitating more confident permitting and better regulatory oversight of the industry . \nI do n't think it would work to delay , '' Reilly said . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThere 's plenty that the engineers and ecologists do n't know , Overton said , starting with how to collect oil samples in deep water -LRB- there are sampling techniques to collect plants and animals , but not crude -RRB- . \nAs he told it , when the samplers went down into the Gulf , they got coated with oil , so it was impossible to tell if the oil was just a layer they passed through or whether it was a true sample of what was there at the sea bed . \nNow that the Macondo well has been capped and a final `` bottom kill '' is seemingly within reach , it 's probably natural for everyone to want to turn the page . \nBut researchers want to actually know what happened . \nShould oil royalties help pay for that research ? \nPhoto credit : REUTERS\\/Sean Gardner -LRB- two photos -RRB- -LRB- BP worker Randy Murry holds up a sample of water taken from the Gulf of Mexico to be tested , while working on the Swamp Queen III skimmer near Venice , Louisiana , August 1 , 2010 . \n; Oil clings to marsh grass in South Pass near Venice , Louisiana , August 1 , 2010 . -RRB- \nThese so called experts already know what oil does to the environment ... just another excuse to keep their jobs , spend the money on those that have already lost theirs ... . \nSo , the great oil glutton is seeking compensation for the environmental consequences of the Gulf oil disaster ; a very worthy precedent for future generations who will have to suffer a global catastrophe that will largely be sourced from this gluttony , or maybe the glutton will insist on a professional risk assessment , unlike the Gulf authorities who signally failed to assess the risk arising from drilling a mile under the sea . \nThe federal government should allocate at least 50 % of its Gulf oil spill royalties to pay for continued research of the spill itself . \nWhile it would be extremely hard to fix the stupidity of companies willing to employ substandard drilling precautions , a simpler and more effective method of clean up and eradication is out there . \nPictures of stagnant brown beaches , innocent animals covered in oil , and entire ecosystems destroyed by the spill should be enough to motivate those in Washington to at least attempt to understand what happened . \nOil spills are not a common occurrence , so neither is the research behind them . \nAnd for one event to virtually destroy the entire Gulf of Mexico , OUR Gulf of Mexico , for years and years to come , I believe some insight into how an event such as this can be avoided or handled more properly is necessary . \nOr we can focus on simply compensating those affected and be screwed next time something like this happens . \nWe are all humans and we all make mistakes , let s grow up and focus on taking care of business rather than pointing fingers . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI 've covered the Winter Olympics in Calgary and Salt Lake City , a couple wars , the State Department , White House , Pentagon , several long trials and a presidential sex scandal . \nSince 2006 , I 've been reporting on the environment and climate change . \n"}

'' \n`` We 've never represented anything different than that . \nThat 's why emphasis is always on preventing these things from occurring , because when they happen we are not very well equipped to deal with them , '' Tillerson said . \nLawmakers seemed unconvinced that the four major oil companies had better contingency plans than BP , which is still struggling to contain the oil that has been gushing into the ocean from a ruptured well for nearly two months . \nThe hearing could lead to new legislation that would have wide impact in the U.S. Gulf , America 's best hope for increasing its domestic oil supply . \nIt 's also one of the most promising exploration frontiers for companies including BP , Shell and Chevron . \nOne by one the lawmakers took turns heaping criticism on the oil executives who sat expressionless as they stared facing rows of their inquisitors . \n`` Lawmakers won , no question . \nAs soon as the companies were asked why they were better , it ended up making them all look worse in the eyes of the lawmakers , '' said Kevin Book , analyst at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington . \nThough all five men were seated at the same large table , it was clearly four against one with BP America 's chief Lamar McKay looking solitary at the end of the table as he faced most of the verbal attacks . \nWhile McKay silently listened to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns of Florida demand his resignation , the other executives had only to defend their policies and insist that they would have done it differently . \nMcKay , who appeared drawn but showed little emotion , did not offer much new ahead of Thursday 's testimony by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , on Capitol Hill . \nThough Wall Street investors shrugged off the hearing as political theater , it is a tradition in Washington and a conduit of public anger , especially ahead of November elections . \nRepresentative Bart Stupak , a Democrat and one of the lawmakers heading a probe of the disaster , slammed the companies ' response plans for offshore accidents . \nHe singled out Exxon Mobil for having a 40-page media response strategy , including pre-written talking points . \n`` Exxon Mobil 's plan appears more concerned about public perception than wildlife protection given the fact that their media plan is fives times longer than its plan for protecting wildlife , '' said Stupak , adding that all of the companies ' plans were `` virtually worthless when an actual spill occurs . '' \nRepresentative Henry Waxman , a Democrat , said the companies had submitted nearly identical `` cookie cutter '' strategies to deal with a major spill which all included techniques that had failed to stem the flow of oil from BP 's well . \n`` We found that none of the five companies has an adequate plan , '' he said . \nBP 's McKay was emotionless when repeatedly asked by Markey to apologize for under-estimating how much oil was gushing into the ocean after the well ruptured . \n`` We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through , we are sorry for that and the spill , '' he said , adding that the company did not have the technology to measure the amount of spilled oil . \nBut though the four non-BP executives appeared to stick together , chatting apart from McKay when the hearing ended , they still had to face public anger . \nAs the hearing came to a close , a protester holding a soda bottle filled with a black liquid approached the executives shouting , `` You all are just as corrupt as BP . \nYou should all be ashamed of yourself .

'' \nThe usually clubby oil industry may fragment in front of Congress as top executives from BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell argue that deepwater drilling is safe if proper procedure is followed . \n`` This incident represents a dramatic departure from the industry norm in deepwater drilling , '' Exxon Mobil Chairman and Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said in prepared testimony obtained by Reuters . \nMillions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP 's well . \nThe spill , the biggest in U.S. history , has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries , and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . \nThe massive spill has overshadowed Obama 's political agenda , eclipsing job creation and Wall Street reform . \nBoth are key issues in November congressional elections in which Obama 's fellow Democrats are expected to face a tough fight to hold onto their majorities in both houses . \nObama , on his fourth visit to the Gulf Coast since the crisis began , said he would press BP executives at a White House meeting on Wednesday to deal `` justly , fairly and promptly '' with spill damage claims . \nIn New York , BP 's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 9.71 percent on investor concern the company may give in to calls by U.S. politicians to suspend its quarterly dividend . \nIn London , BP shares closed down 9.3 percent . \nUnder intense pressure from the Obama administration , BP unveiled a new plan on Monday to vastly boost the amount of oil it is siphoning off from its ruptured well . \nBP said it planned to send more vessels to the spill site to increase its capacity to capture oil from 15,000 barrels a day now to 40,000-53 ,000 barrels by the end of this month and 60,000-80 ,000 by mid-July . \nIn a pivotal week in the 56-day-old crisis , Obama began a two-day visit to the Gulf coast . \nHe will address the nation on Tuesday , before he meets BP executives for what a White House spokesman said would be a `` very frank '' encounter on Wednesday . \nAhead of the congressional hearings on Tuesday and Thursday , lawmakers Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak released a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward laying out a potentially damning account of the events leading up to the rig explosion . \n`` It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , '' their letter said . \nA BP spokesman declined to comment before the hearings . \nSweat beading his face in the hot weather , Obama on Monday toured fouled beaches and visited businesses laid low by the collapse of tourism . \nHe promised the Gulf would bounce back , urged Americans not to cancel travel plans to the region and said the seafood was safe . \nIn the evening , he sampled crawfish tails and crab claws at a waterside restaurant in Orange Beach , Alabama . \nThe president faces intense criticism that he has not shown enough leadership in the spill and will seek to use his meeting with BP executives and his first nationally televised Oval Office speech to show he is on top of the crisis . \nBut Anthony Bourgeois , 62 , a seventh-generation commercial fisherman , said the situation was past the point where Obama 's words could quickly bring a quick solution . \n`` There ai n't much he can say . \nWe 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' Bourgeois said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana . \nMany on the Gulf Coast are torn between support for the oil industry , an economic mainstay , and anger . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said the coast was in a `` war to stop this oil '' but also asked Obama to put a quick end to a drilling moratorium . \nBP has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of the cleanup and last week was confronted with a White House threat to widen its liabilities for the disaster . \nThe company has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since the crisis began . \n`` The concern is that BP is going to cut its dividend and that 's weighing on the stock , '' said Andy Fitzpatrick , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates , in Hinsdale , Illinois . \nBP has hired investment banks Blackstone Group LP , Goldman Sachs Group and Credit Suisse Group as advisers , a source familiar with the matter said , without disclosing the purpose of the move . \nThe spill has created an unprecedented financial , legal , regulatory and environmental crisis for companies that operate in the Gulf , Moody 's Investors Service warned in a report on Monday , saying it could be up to two years before oil production reaches pre-spill levels and that a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling posed many uncertainties . \nObama announced the final five people he wants to join a commission to make recommendations for the future of offshore drilling -- all environmentalists and academics with no clear representative of the oil industry . \nIn his meeting with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg on Wednesday , Obama will press for the company to set up an independently managed fund to pay oil spill damage claims . \nSpeaking in Theodore , Alabama , Obama said the White House was already talking to BP about the fund and hoped agreement on a framework for claims payments would be reached by Wednesday . \nGulf Coast residents have been complaining for weeks the BP claims process is too slow and that the money the company is paying out is too little to make ends meet . \nU.S. politicians have been calling on BP to scrap its quarterly dividend to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay the compensation claims and clean up the spill . \nBP 's Hayward will make his first appearance at a congressional hearing on Thursday and is expected to face harsh questioning from lawmakers . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nObama knows the newspapers and TV stations are under his control , they 'll never go up against him in a realistic way . \nObama does n't care what happens to us white people in Louisiana or Alabama

'' \nBefore he spoke , Obama named Michael Bromwich , a former Justice Department official , to lead an overhaul of the Minerals Management Service , the oil-drilling oversight agency that has faced a crescendo of criticism since the spill . \nObama vowed that a `` cozy relationship '' between oil companies and their regulators would no longer be tolerated . \nAt Tuesday 's congressional hearing , executives from Exxon Mobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell declined to answer when one lawmaker asked whether they would disagree that BP had made mistakes in constructing its ill-fated Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nRepresentative Edward Markey pushed BP 's U.S. boss , Lamar McKay , to apologize for not being able to accurately estimate the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico . \nMillions of gallons have poured into the Gulf , fouling 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiling multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins . \nOil gushed unchecked for several hours from the well on Tuesday after a small fire onboard an oil-collecting ship forced a suspension of siphoning operation , but the operation resumed before Obama spoke . \n`` We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through , we are sorry for that and the spill , '' a drawn-looking McKay said , adding that the company did not have the technology to measure the amount of spilled oil . \nLaying out the steps that his company was taking to contain the spill , he said BP soon would have up to six ships on the scene to deal with oil siphoned from the spewing well . \nAs McKay was speaking , BP 's U.S.-listed shares jumped and trading volumes spiked . \nThey rose 4 percent at one point in afternoon trading before closing up 2.35 percent . \nThey had plunged 9 percent on Monday . \nIn London , shares of BP , which could face billions of dollars in damage claims from the spill , closed down 3.78 percent on Tuesday . \nRating agency Fitch smacked BP with a hefty six-notch downgrade on its debt rating . \nThat puts BP 's debt just two notches above junk , which would mean a significant boost in the company 's cost of borrowing . \nBP has lost about half of its market value since the spill began two months ago . \nBank of America Merrill Lynch has ordered its traders not to enter into oil trades with BP that extend beyond June 2011 , a market source familiar with the directive told Reuters on Tuesday . \nAhead of his speech , Obama was in Florida on the second day of a two-day tour of Gulf Coast communities hit by the 57-day-old spill . \n`` This is an assault on our shores and we 're going to fight back with everything that we 've got , '' Obama said in a speech at the Pensacola Naval Air Station . \nBP said its new containment cap system had captured 15,420 barrels from its Gulf of Mexico well on Monday . \nThe system has collected 149,900 barrels since it was installed on June 3 . \nOne oil barrel equals 42 U.S. gallons -LRB- 160 liters -RRB- . \nBut thousands of gallons of oil are still pouring into the Gulf every day and a definitive solution is not expected until August , when BP is due to complete drilling two relief wells . \nIt is a critical week for the company -- top executives are due to meet Obama at the White House on Wednesday , when the president will press them to set up a special fund to pay damage claims to victims of the spill . \nChief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP 's response to the spill , is due to testify for the first time at a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nGoldman-Sachs , the greatest financial criminal , will be helping BP , the greatest environmental criminal . \nBirds of a feather . \nThis is just lip service . \nObama knows the newspapers and TV stations are under his control , they 'll never go up against him in a realistic way . \nObama does n't care what happens to us white people in Louisiana or Alabama , as long as it effects Whitie he 'll never have a sense of urgency on his part , nor do the White Elitists who run Washington give a damn either , -LRB- unless it affects their stocks & bonds portforlio -RRB- . \nTheir prejudices towards those who do n't belong to their elitist left wing class reeks . \nBy their own words they refer to us as rednecks , too stupid to think for ourselves . \nAs far as The Elitists are concerned middle & lower class white people are good for only two things : taxes and using our daughters and sons for their sexual pleasure . \nObama intentionally keeps the border open because he wants illegal drugs swamping the country and destroying our young . \nA drugged up and poorly educated -

'' \nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said Obama should not be blamed for the spill , according to the advance transcript of a pre-taped interview on Bloomberg TV 's `` Political Capital . '' \n`` I would give him fairly low marks in terms of responding to the consequences of the spill , but stopping the leak , nobody could do any better , '' Graham said . \n`` We 're trying everything under the sun to stop the leak , and it 's not his fault that we ca n't find a way to cap it . '' \nAbout one-third of Gulf of Mexico federal waters remains closed to fishing , and oil has spread to Florida 's Pensacola and Perdido passes , two gateways to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway . \nAt Perdido Bay , on the border between Florida and Alabama , orange booms were stained with thick brown oil as workers tied absorbent ` pom poms ' to them to prevent the oil seeping further into the waterways . \n`` We want to make sure areas where there may be nesting , we want to have extra booms in those areas , '' said Alexis Brooks , incident information officer at Gulf Islands National Seashore . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI am a proud American . \nI also think Americans are as responsible as BP . \nAmericans have been taking money from BP for a long time . \nSarah Palin 's life style over the years has been paid for by BP . \nIn fact Alaska and Alaskan politicians benefited from BP . \nFor that matter BP deep pockets have paid for much of congresses reelection campaign Democrats Republican for years in one way or the other . \nIt is difficult to defend BP , knowing its safety record . \nBP has amassed something in the neighborhood of 93 times the number of safety violations than its two closest competitors . \nIf the British want to group themselves with BP , its image , and safety record , that 's up to them . \nIf you break something you pay for it . \nI 'm not a Britain basher but BP needs to be held accountable for and to pay for any and all costs that have been incurred as a result of this spill . \nHow can any company justify paying dividends when they have such a huge unpaid and un-prearranged liability ? \nIf they ca n't afford to pay it all in one go -LRB- and it sounds like in actual fact they can -RRB- then some sort of payment plan could be worked out for them . \nHowever , the payment plan should cover not just cleanup and compensation for current damages but should also include any future lost earnings and any losses attributable to the delay in payment of the compensation itself . \nThe bottom line is that no one should come out of this financially worse off except for BP themselves . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

Bobby Jindal said . \nBP , the British energy company , has been working to plug a leak nearly a mile under the surface of the ocean , under heavy pressure from the U.S. government to try to limit a looming ecological and economic disaster . \nTony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , and Lamar McKay , BP America president , met on Monday with top Obama administration officials including the energy , interior and homeland security secretaries and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , to discuss coordinated response efforts . \nSeparately , BP said crews in Louisiana have finished building the first of three massive steel and concrete containment domes the company plans to lower in place over one of the three leaks on the ocean floor . \n`` We will load that on a ship tomorrow along with other associated equipment , and transport it to the site , '' Doug Suttles , chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , told reporters on a conference call . \nDrilling also started Sunday night on a relief well that could cap the oil spill on the Gulf floor , the company said . \nStill , this operation is expected to take two to three months to complete . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the oil slick , which continues to spread over a wider surface area in the warm Gulf waters , will move further east and west by Tuesday , although not necessarily further north toward the coast . \nEfforts to prevent the slow-moving mass from washing ashore in parts of four states have been hampered for days by choppy seas and high waves in the Gulf , but forecasts suggest calmer conditions in the next few days . \n`` The stormy weather is clearing as we speak , '' Shawn O'Neil , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in New Orleans , said . \n`` The winds will stay light and variable all the way through Friday . \nThey will have much improved conditions to do what they need to get done . '' \nMiles of booms are being laid along the coast of four states in an effort to contain the movement of oil onto beaches and into key wildlife sanctuaries and breeding grounds . \nThe Obama administration has kept the focus on BP to pay for and assume responsibility for the oil spill disaster , which started with an explosion April 20 on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers . \nFor its part , the federal government has come under fire for not responding more quickly to the spreading economic and environmental threat -- criticisms that may have prompted Obama to travel to the affected region on Sunday . \nThe oil spill , which continues unchecked for now , could ultimately rival the Exxon Valdez disaster from 1989 . \nThat spill was caused when a single , massive oil tanker spewed some 10.8 million gallons or 250,000 barrels of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound . \nEstimates put the daily flow from the current well leak at 5,000 barrels or more , but government and company officials have suggested they that estimate could be low . \nComments by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that the Justice Department was involved in the investigation of the incident raised the specter of criminal liability for BP over the spill . \nA Justice Department official said it was not a criminal probe at this stage . \nBP 's Hayward on Monday acknowledged his company 's responsibility in a round of appearances on American TV and radio shows , a day after U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the administration would keep `` keep the boot on the neck '' of BP to fulfill its legal responsibilities . \nAnalysts say BP 's total liability could exceed $ 14 billion . \nIn New York , American Depositary Receipts of BP 's shares fell 3.7 percent to close at $ 50.19 . \nShares of Transocean Ltd , operator of the sunken oil rig , rose 0.82 percent to 72.91 . \nArgus Research on Monday downgraded both Transocean and BP to `` hold '' from `` buy '' citing negative impact from the Deepwater Horizon spill . \n`` In many ways , the timing of this incident could not have been worse , as President Obama recently supported the expansion of drilling activity to areas where it was previously prohibited , '' the brokerage said . \nMississippi Governor Haley Barbour , speaking on CNN , said Obama should not move hastily , despite the leak 's severity . \n`` It would n't be very wise to stop all drilling off the Gulf of Mexico , '' Barbour said , noting that the Deepwater Horizon well was `` one of thousands '' in the area . \nOil prices moved above $ 86 a barrel as economic optimism lifted Wall Street and concerns the spill could cause short-term disruptions to supplying . \nSo far , major shipping lanes in the Gulf of Mexico have not seen delays . \nBut the rate to charter oil and product tankers in the Caribbean and Gulf Coast region has surged by 50 percent or more over the past week on worries about potential delays from the oil spill , analysts said . \nFishing in a wide swathe of federal waters between Louisiana and Florida 's Pensacola Bay was restricted for 10 days on Sunday to avoid any chance that contaminated seafood will make its way to store shelves . \nWildlife experts also fear a heavy toll on animals and birds . \nNear Gulfport , Mississippi , 19 sea turtles were found dead and necropsies were being done by experts at the National Marine Fisheries Services . \nBut they had no external oil soiling and it was not clear if the deaths were linked to the slick . \nBefore significant amounts of oil potentially come ashore , environmental groups were mobilizing thousands of volunteers to prepare for clean-up efforts . \nThose that make their living from the sea were already counting their losses . \n`` We have an opportunity to lose our entire fishery down here . \nI mean , not just the customers . \nIt 's everything , '' said Ross Barkhurst , a boat owner in Venice . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI 'm convinced the oil will reach there by then . \nBrace yourselves people , because if you think your life will not be impacted by this disaster , it will . \nTime to wake up to what we 've -LRB- yes , WE 've -RRB- done to ourselves . \n`` BP officials have likened efforts to fix the failed preventer to performing `` open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark .

'' \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward was due to meet Monday with the Interior and Homeland Security secretaries and other U.S. officials to discuss how to control the widening spill . \nWEATHER HAMPERING FIGHT AGAINST SLICK Hayward on Monday acknowledged his company 's responsibility in appearances on American TV and radio shows , a day after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the administration would keep `` keep the boot on the neck '' of BP to fulfill its legal responsibilities . \n`` We are responsible not for the accident but we are responsible for the oil and for dealing with it and cleaning the situation up , '' Hayward told NBC 's `` Today '' show . \nHe told National Public Radio the company would pay all `` legitimate claims '' from the spill . \nIn Louisiana , the first point of impact for the slick , rough weather once again hampered efforts to lay protective plastic booms to keep the oil from the shore . \n`` It 's really bad . \nI mean they ca n't lay down the boom in this kind of weather with the oil slinging on top . \nIt 's pouring all over the top ... I was going to work today but they turned us around because of the weather , '' fisherman Thomas Tiser , one of many recruited for the cleanup , told Reuters Television . \nPeople living along the Gulf coast were bracing for the slick . \n`` We have an opportunity to lose our entire fishery down here . \nI mean , not just the customers . \nIt 's everything , '' said Ross Barkhurst , a boat owner in Venice . \nIn a visit to Louisiana , one of four coastal states at risk , Obama stressed on Sunday BP was responsible for paying for the cleanup involving hundreds of boats and planes and thousands of military and civil personnel across five U.S. states . \nAnalysts say the total costs of the spill following the explosion and sinking of a drilling rig operated by Swiss-based driller Transocean nearly two weeks ago could exceed $ 14 billion . \nBP said last week that it and its partners in the well , including Anadarko Petroleum , were paying $ 6 million a day in cleanup efforts but admitted costs would rise sharply when the oil slick hit land , as would claims for damages . \nHayward said the technical options his company was working on to try to seal the ruptured well included an undersea containment system that would capture the leaking oil and channel it to a tanker on the surface . \nAnother option was the drilling of a relief well to intersect the ruptured well and try to control and plug the flow that way , Hayward added . \n`` The worst-case scenario is that we would need to contain this for two to three months whilst a relief oil is drilled , '' Hayward told NBC . \nBP was also using undersea robots to try to fix the well blowout preventer , a mechanism he said had failed to keep the oil from gushing from the stricken rig after the accident . \nBP officials have likened efforts to fix the failed preventer to performing `` open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark . '' \n`` No one understands why it 's failed , '' Hayward said . \nFishing in a wide swathe of federal waters between Louisiana and Florida 's Pensacola Bay was restricted for 10 days on Sunday to avoid any chance that contaminated seafood will make its way to store shelves . \nThe Gulf supports a seafood industry that is second only to Alaska in the United States . \nThe area accounts for the bulk of U.S. production of oysters and shrimp . \nWildlife experts also fear a heavy toll on animals and birds . \nNear Gulfport , Mississippi , 19 sea turtles were found dead and necropsies were being done by experts at the National Marine Fisheries Services . \nBut they had no external oil soiling and it was not clear if the deaths were linked to the slick . \nU.S. energy output from the Gulf has not been not strongly affected and shipping operations at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port were normal , a port spokeswoman said . \nMany of the coastal communities in the path of the oil slick , including Venice on the west bank of the Mississippi River , were devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \n`` It 's just like Katrina , catastrophic , '' said Frances Lacross , a local resident . \nThe looming disaster in the Gulf threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill of 11 million gallons -LRB- 40.8 million liters -RRB- in Alaska , the worst previous U.S. oil spill to date . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIn this case `` only '' fish , shrimps , oysters and sea birds will be affected but if a nuclear power station melts down potential tens of millions of people will be affected , will die , develop diseases or bear defective children for generations to come . \nThis oil spill will be forgotten in a few years . \nA nuclear disaster may take thousands of years ... so just sit back and think about this a minute ...

'' \nOil companies say the government has not proven the need for a blanket ban on deep sea drilling and warn it will lead to major layoffs . \nJudge Feldman agreed and in his ruling on Tuesday sharply rebuked the U.S. government . \nBP SHARES HIT NEW LOW The spill has undermined investor confidence in BP , a staple of British pension funds , as estimated clean-up costs soar . \nThe British energy giant has seen its shares lose almost half their value since the spill . \nBP 's U.S.-listed shares closed down 3.13 percent at $ 28.74 in New York trading on Thursday , hitting a new year-low . \nThe company 's stock lost 2.47 percent in London . \nAnalysts said investors were reacting to news that the U.S. government was reviewing the environmental impact of BP plans to drill in Alaska . \n`` Think about it . \nHow many holes can you have in a bucket ? \nThere are just too many problems , '' said Joe Saluzzi , co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham , New Jersey . \nShareholders are also worried about how much BP will ultimately have to pay for cleaning up the mess in the Gulf of Mexico . \nUnder U.S. political pressure , it agreed last week to set up a $ 20 billion fund to pay damages to oil spill victims . \nBP also faces more than 240 spill-related lawsuits , most filed on behalf of businesses , including commercial fishermen , shippers and resort operators , according to the Westlaw database . \nWestlaw is a unit of Thomson Reuters . \nBut at its current levels BP 's share price is attracting some interest -- fund managers who focus on undervalued and unloved stocks have started buying BP shares . \nThe purchases seem small so far and some portfolio managers are still analyzing whether the company will come out of the disaster intact , managers speaking at the Morningstar annual investing conference in Chicago said on Thursday . \nBP said its oil-capture systems at the leak collected or burned off 16,830 barrels of oil on Wednesday , a 38 percent drop from Tuesday 's record rate of 27,100 , after an underwater accident forced a 10-hour shutdown . \nWith the hurricane season having officially started on June 1 , BP is keeping an eye on stormy weather , which could hamper its clean-up and containment efforts . \nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said a tropical wave over the western Caribbean Sea could develop into a tropical depression over the next couple of days as it moves toward the Gulf of Mexico . \nMost weather models forecast it would move toward the southern Texas and Mexico coasts . \nEarlier , some models had projected the wave would move toward the BP clean-up operation in the central U.S. Gulf Coast . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThere is way too much pressure to cap it with mud or cement . \nCome on BP don t make a bad situation worse . \nUse a one million lb malleable lead tapered cap . \nYou will have to cut loose the Blowout Preventer first using a CLEAN CUT . \nStop the insane dispersants . \nIt is worse than cleaning the oil on the surface , way worse . \nIf BP wants to collect the oil , perhaps they should consider using a capture pipe to the surface the same size or larger then the pipe installed at the Blow-Out Preventer instead of the `` Garden Hose '' They are using now . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nThe April 20 explosion on a BP-leased oil rig that led to the worst environmental accident in U.S. history triggered a wave of congressional investigations . \nFollowing several high-profile hearings , including testimony from top BP officials , bills to address the problem are beginning to move and others are being drafted . \nIt 's too early to know how their final versions will look or when Congress might complete the work . \nWaxman 's committee alone has held seven hearings on the oil spill since May 12 . \nOne House Democratic aide said that members of the Energy and Commerce Committee `` have heard enough information to at least get started in terms of the regulatory and legislative responses '' to the disaster . \nLast month , President Barack Obama created an independent commission to probe the oil spill . \nBut with that panel only now getting organized , Democrats in Congress are not waiting for it to wrap up its work sometime next year , when Republicans likely will hold more seats in the Senate and House . \n`` We want to make sure that where there 's a government permit to allow drilling , that all necessary safety measures are reviewed and approved and that the standards are met , '' Waxman said . \nA House Democratic leadership aide added , `` It 's my understanding '' that Waxman is writing legislation addressing the `` design , maintenance and testing of drilling equipment .

Mary Landrieu -LRB- D-La . -RRB- \n, who last week cautioned that the incident should `` not be used inappropriately '' to halt Obama 's push for expansion of offshore drilling , has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of BP 's largesse . \nHer comments created some blowback , with critics complaining that she is too blas about the impact of the disaster , even though she was among the first lawmakers to call for a federal investigation into the spill . \nAs the top congressional recipient in the last cycle and one of the top BP cash recipients of the past two decades , Landrieu banked almost $ 17,000 from the oil giant in 2008 alone and has lined her war chest with more than $ 28,000 in BP cash overall . \n`` Campaign contributions , from energy companies or from environmental groups , have absolutely no impact on Sen. Landrieu 's policy agenda or her response to this unprecedented disaster in the Gulf , '' said Landrieu spokesman Aaron Saunders . \n`` The senator is proud of the broad coalition she 's built since her first day in the Senate to address the energy and environmental challenges in Louisiana and in the nation . \nThis disaster only makes the effort to promote and save Louisiana 's coast all that more important . '' \nSeveral BP executives have given directly to Landrieu 's campaign , including current and previous U.S. operation Presidents Lamar McKay and Robert Malone . \nOther donors include Margaret Hudson , BP 's America vice president , and Benjamin Cannon , federal affairs director for the U.S. branch . \nDonations ranged from $ 1,000 to $ 2,300 during the past campaign cycle . \nEnvironmentalists complain that Landrieu has played down the impact of oil spills . \n`` I mean , just the gallons are so minuscule compared to the benefits of U.S. strength and security , the benefits of job creation and energy security , '' Landrieu said at a hearing last month on offshore drilling . \n`` So while there are risks associated with everything , I think you understand that they are quite , quite minimal . '' \n`` They own Mary Landrieu and the rest of the Louisiana delegation , '' said Greenpeace Research Director Kert Davies . \n`` They have more money , disposable income and a fleet of dispensable lobbyists to beat the band . '' \nOther politicians with ties to coastal states or states with BP refineries have also reaped benefits from the fourth largest company in the world . \nThe top congressional recipients of BP campaign cash include Republican Rep. Don Young of the oil-intensive Alaska delegation , who has received almost as much as Obama , raking in $ 73,300 during his congressional tenure . \nAlso on the list is Sen. George Voinovich -LRB- R-Ohio -RRB- , whose state has a BP refinery in Toledo and who has raked in $ 41,400 . \nSen. John McCain -LRB- R-Ariz . -RRB- \nhas received $ 44,899 . \n`` Make no mistake : BP ranks among the most powerful corporate forces in U.S. politics , '' said Dave Levinthal , spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics . \n`` It donates hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle through its employees and political action committee and is routinely a seven - or eight-figure federal lobbying powerhouse each year . '' \nIn 2008 alone , BP gave $ 37,000 to members of the House Energy Committee and $ 106,501 to members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , which deals with security issues facing the nation 's oil supply . \nBP has also evolved in its corporate giving over the past decade , shifting more money to Democrats . \nIn 2000 , the company gave almost 39 percent more to Republicans than to Democrats . \nBut by 2008 , Democrats had nearly pulled even with Republicans on BP donations . \nMoreover , the company has nearly tripled the amount of money it has spent on lobbying , from about $ 5.7 million in 1999 to $ 15.9 million last year , according to lobbying disclosures . \nBP has bulked up its K Street team by signing some of the biggest firms in Washington , several of which employ former Hill staffers with deep-seated ties to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico coast . \nBP representation within lobby shop Alpine Group alone includes lobbyist Bob Brooks , who served as chief of staff to former Rep.

'' \nU.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is scheduled to visit wildlife refuges in Alabama and Louisiana later on Wednesday to keep the pressure on BP after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which killed 11 workers and started the flow of oil into the sea . \nOther top U.S. officials continue to beat a path to the Gulf Coast to monitor containment and cleanup efforts . \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco and EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe will travel to the region this week to meet with federal , state and local officials , as well as local business leaders . \nEnvironmental regulators reported a `` first sighting '' of a slick near the Chandeleur Islands , three narrow islands off the southeast coast of Louisiana , on Tuesday . \nLocal officials worried another potential swing in wind direction could threaten the Chandeleurs . \n`` We have not received any confirmed landfall of oil , '' said Petty Officer David Mosley of the U.S. Coast Guard , who spoke from the Unified Command Centre in Roberts , Louisiana . \nIn Venice , Louisiana , workers loaded lengths of boom onto a barge as part of a plan to protect a vast network of inshore estuaries and canals that form the Mississippi Delta . \n`` We will monitor the water quality from the barge and at the first sign of oil we will deploy -LRB- the boom -RRB- immediately , '' said Kurt Fromherz , spokesman for Plaquemines parish . \nThe leak , still weeks or months away from being stopped , threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe in Alaska , the worst U.S. oil spill . \nMississippi , Alabama and Florida are also threatened by the leak . \nIf the slick contacts the so-called Loop sea current , the oily sheen could eventually be carried to Miami in southern Florida , or as far as North Carolina 's barrier islands , warned Robert Weisberg , a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida . \n`` Exactly when the oil will enter the Loop Current at the surface is unknown , but it appears to be imminent , '' Weisberg said , referring to the prevailing current in the Gulf . \n"}

'' \nThe administration will probably ask for a stay of the court ruling as it pursues its appeal . \nThe court 's decision was a victory for offshore energy producers like BP , Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell . \nThey have been hamstrung by the ban , and are eyeing relocating their giant rigs to other basins like Brazil . \nShares in oil drilling companies briefly spiked after the ruling but dipped again when the Obama administration said it would appeal . \nThe S&P energy sector fell 1.3 percent . \nBP 's London-listed shares hit their lowest level since February 1997 on Tuesday , dropping more than 5 percent before coming off lows . \nU.S.-listed shares closed down 2.14 percent at $ 29.68 . \nThey have not traded around these levels since 1996 . \nIn London , BP 's shares have fallen 32 percent in June alone and are on track to suffer their worst month since at least 1965 , according to Thomson Reuters Datastream . \nThe court ruling infuriated U.S. environmental groups . \nThe Sierra Club said it would join the Obama administration in appealing it and called the ruling `` a slap in the face to the communities that have been hit hard by this tragedy .

-LRB- BP . \nN -RRB- , British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Friday some certainty is needed over its costs from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill even as the company 's stock plunged to a 14-year low . \nTotal share losses for the embattled British energy giant since the worst oil spill in U.S. history began on April 20 stand at around $ 100 billion , more than halving its market value prior to the disaster . \nBP stock on Friday fell more than 6 percent in London and New York . \nBP plans to nearly double next week its capacity for siphoning oil gushing from its ruptured deep-sea well , but a looming storm is raising fears the effort could be disrupted for days or weeks . \nBP and the U.S. government nervously watched as an approaching low-pressure system over the western Caribbean Sea gathered strength . \nCameron is due to meet on Saturday with U.S. President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the G8\\/G20 summits in Canada . \nHe has pledged to discuss BP with Obama , who has been highly critical of the company . \nBritish business and shareholder groups have clamored for Cameron to defend the company . \n`` I think it is also in all our long-term interests that there is some clarity , some finality , to all of this , so that we do n't at the same time see the destruction of a company that is important for all our interests , '' Cameron told Canadian broadcaster CBC . \nBP said it has paid out $ 2.35 billion so far in clean-up and compensation costs related to the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nThat does not include the $ 20 billion oil spill fund it has agreed to set up , nor the billions of dollars it will have to pay in fines . \nUnder the Clean Water Act , BP could potentially face penalties of at least $ 15 billion . \n`` This is a vital company for all of our interests . \nThe view I take is that BP itself wants to cap the well and clean up the spill and compensate those who have had damages , '' Cameron said . \n`` It wants to do these things , it will do these things . \nI want to work with everyone concerned to try to make sure that out of all this there will still be a strong and stable BP , because it is an important company for all of us , '' he added . \nBP was once a predominantly British company but now has global operations and a major presence in the United States . \nAround 40 percent of its shareholder base is in Britain and a similar proportion is drawn from the United States . \nKenneth Feinberg , the man appointed by Obama to oversee BP 's $ 20 billion compensation fund , said it made `` absolutely no sense '' to drive the company into bankruptcy . \nHe was speaking at a public event in Larose , Louisiana . \nThe well ruptured on April 20 when an explosion blew up an offshore rig on the surface above it , killing 11 workers . \nThe spill has soiled the U.S. Gulf coastline and threatened multibillion dollar tourism and fishing industries . \nIn London , its stock plunged 6.4 percent on Friday , trading at its lowest levels since 1996 , on talk it needs extra cash to fund the clean-up and worries about bad weather . \nOn Friday , U.S.-listed shares dropped 6.1 percent , also to a 14-year low , on a rumor that analysts recommended the company sell stock . \n`` There was talk that a couple of Wall Street analysts had recommended the company do a $ 10 billion equity offering . \nAside from all the other problems facing the company , if they issued shares now , it would represent dilution to current shareholders , '' said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport , Connecticut . \nA spokesman for BP said it had `` considerable firepower '' to meet the costs of the spill and denied market talk that the company was seeking bankruptcy protection . \nIn the Gulf , BP said its oil-capture systems collected or burned off 23,725 barrels of oil on Thursday . \nU.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who oversees the federal relief effort , said BP was on track to nearly double its oil collection capacity next week . \n`` We will have three vessels and 53,000 barrels a day of capacity by the end of June , '' he said . \nThe U.S. government estimates between 35,000 -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the well . \nBP 's oil collection effort , which has been dogged by a series of mishaps including an underwater accident this week , faces a new threat -- stormy weather . \nAllen said it would be necessary five days ahead of the arrival of any gale force winds to start to take down the current operations involving ships and other equipment collecting some of the oil spewing from the ruptured well . \nBecause of this , oil could flow unchecked from the ruptured well into the sea for up to 14 days , Allen said . \nWeather forecast models are divided on whether the system , now in the western Caribbean , will turn northwest toward Mexico , northeast toward the Florida Panhandle or north toward the central Gulf where BP is struggling to stop the spill . \nU.S. oil crude surged 3 percent , hitting a seven-week high , on worries the bad weather could potentially threaten Gulf oil production . \nThe concerns also boosted U.S. natural gas futures by nearly 2 percent . \nBP said two relief wells that offer the best hope of plugging its well were on track to intercept their target at a depth of 18,000 feet . \nThe wells are due to be completed in August . \nU.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman , who blocked the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , on Tuesday sold his holdings in Exxon Mobil Corp -LRB- XOM . \nN -RRB- , worth $ 15,000 or less , just four hours

slick bore down on the Gulf Coast on Sunday , threatening an economic and ecological disaster as President Barack Obama sharpened his criticism of BP Plc and pressed the energy giant to halt the oil gushing from its ruptured well . \n`` Let me be clear : BP is responsible for this leak . \nBP will be paying the bill , '' said Obama as he visited the area and pledged a `` fully coordinated , relentless relief effort '' in the region where the coastlines of four Gulf states are being menaced . \nThe swelling black tide threatens wildlife , beaches and one of the nation 's most fertile fishing grounds stretching across the Mississippi Delta from Louisiana to Florida . \n`` We a dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' Obama said . \nThe president toured wetlands in Louisiana at risk from the oil spill , and flew over the coastal areas containing fisheries that could be most affected by the slick . \nDesperate efforts above and below the ocean surface -- using boats , planes and even an underwater robotic vehicle -- to check the oil flow and disperse and contain the spreading slick were being hampered by high winds and rough seas . \nThe government suspended fishing on Sunday across a wide swath of its Gulf of Mexico waters , on worries about contamination of seafood . \n`` This is a terrible day . \nPeople can still fish west -LRB- of the Mississippi river -RRB- but if the oil keeps flowing the whole coast could be closed down , '' Roger Halphen , whose whole family is involved in commercial fishing , told Reuters in Venice . \nA team of government agencies is working on relief , but Obama and his deputies made it clear BP would be on the hook for what could be billions of dollars in cleanup costs . \n`` BOOT ON THE NECK '' OF BP `` Our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program on Sunday . \nThe final bill for cleaning up the spill could be $ 7 billion , said Neil McMahon , analyst at investment firm Bernstein in London . \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley put the figure at $ 3.5 billion . \nSince the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank last month , claiming 11 lives , hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude has been gushing into the Gulf with no quick or easy sol BP is simultaneously working on five plans to stop the flow of oil , including installing domes to collect the oil on the seabed and bring it to the surface and installing a new blow-out preventer to replace the equipment that failed , company officials told a media briefing . \nThe first of two domes will be deployed in the next six days . \nBP is also preparing to drill two relief wells , but rough weather has hampered its efforts . \nUnderwater dispersants are in use to break up the crude before its reaches the surface . \nBP officials said shutting off the well nearly one mile underwater on the ocean floor is an extraordinarily complicated operation that could take weeks and months . \nIt was like performing `` open heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines , '' BP America Chairman and President Lamar McKay told ABC News . \nShares of BP and other companies involved in operating the lost rig plummeted last week as fears mounted of growing financial costs and legal liability from the accident . \nThe looming disaster threatens to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe in Alaska , the worst previous U.S. oil spill to date . \nThe Valdez spill , caused by a wrecked oil tanker , spilled an estimated 10.8 million gallons -LRB- 40.9 million liters -RRB- of crude oil into Alaska 's remote Prince William Sound . \nGovernment officials are having difficulty guessing how much oil is spilling from the deepwater well , but have raised their initial estimate of 5,000 barrels a day . \n`` The worst case scenario is we could have 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons , or 15.9 million liters -RRB- flowing out -LRB- per day -RRB- , '' Salazar said . \n`` The actual amount is impossible to estimate , '' Doug Suttles , chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit , said on CBS News . \nThe Coast Guard has laid hundreds of thousands of feet of protective booms to try to halt the encroaching oil , but high winds and rough seas were hampering deployment of the barriers and efforts by boats and planes to spray chemical dispersant on the oil . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced it was closing commercial and recreational fishing for at least 10 days in affected waters between Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi River to Florida 's Pensacola Bay . \nThe area accounts for the bulk of U.S. production of oysters and shrimp . \nThe Gulf supports a seafood industry that is second only to Alaska within the United States . \nIn 2008 , commercial fishermen harvested more than 1 billion pounds of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of Mexico , out of total U.S. production of 8.3 billion pounds , NOAA said . \nThe Gulf Coast is home to hundreds of species of wildlife , including manatees , sea turtles , dolphins , porpoises , whales , otters , pelicans and other birds . \nObama 's visit came at a time when his administration had been criticized for acting too slowly in response to the growing problems . \nThe spill has also forced Obama to suspend politically sensitive plans to expand offshore oil drilling , unveiled last month partly to woo Republican support for climate legislation , one of the U.S. leader 's priorities . \nThe Minerals Management Service said two U.S. offshore Gulf of Mexico production platforms had been shut down and a third was evacuated as a safety precaution . \nFurther shutdowns were possible , it added , but the output affected so far was very small . \nWriting by Ros Krasny ; editing by Chris Wilson -RRB- We welcome comments that

'' \nSome Republican opponents questioned the logic of the president making a televised prime-time speech to the country before meeting with top BP executives on Wednesday . \n`` That 's a little surprising to me , '' Republican Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' program about the timing of Obama 's speech . \n`` If I were , as governor , trying to make sure somebody does something , I would meet with them before I went on television . '' \nThe Obama administration has delayed plans to permit new offshore drilling as a result of the spill . \nThe crisis has put Obama on the defensive and distracted his team from the domestic agenda -- a new energy policy , reform of Wall Street and bolstering a struggling American economy . \nMark Tayamen , a Louisiana shrimper idled by the spill , said there is little Obama can say to make him feel better . \n`` This is our livelihood . \nIt 's where we have fun and teach our kids and grandchildren . \nThere ai n't nothing out there now , '' he said in Venice , preparing to take his boat out to rescue oiled birds and animals , thanks to a contract from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . \n`` There ai n't nothing -LRB- Obama -RRB- can say . \nThe damage is done . '' \nPeople in southern Louisiana are frustrated with BP for the spill but also at Obama 's drilling moratorium because many families have members who work in the oil industry . \nThe focus on America 's biggest environmental disaster comes ahead of November 's congressional elections in which the Democrats are expected to struggle to keep their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate . \nU.S. public anger is high as the crisis nears two months and news is marked by images of polluted beaches , oil-covered birds and fishermen anxious about their precarious situation . \nDemocrats want Obama to tap that mood to press for development of alternative energies such as solar and wind power . \nThe United States and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was up to the British energy giant , under pressure in the United States to suspend its stock dividend to help pay for the damage , to make that decision alone . \nA source told Reuters on Sunday the company was unlikely to cancel the dividend , currently valued at about $ 10.5 billion annually . \nThe source told Reuters on Sunday that options being considered were deferring the dividend , paying it in shares or paying into a ring-fenced account until liabilities are known and that the issue probably would not be decided this week . \nBP placed a containment cap on its blown out seabed well this month after a series of failures to stem the flow but oil continues to gush from it , polluting beaches and wildlife habitats , killing marine life and damaging tourism and fishing . \nThe partly contained leak is estimated to flow at up to 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- a day . \nU.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson told BP in a June 11 letter made public Saturday that its containment plan did not go far enough or include enough back-up measures in the event of equipment failure or other problems . \nHe gave the company two days to come up with a fix . \nThad Allen , the U.S. Coast Guard admiral heading the federal relief effort , told CBS he expects BP to present a plan to increase oil capture later on Sunday . \nU.S. lawmakers have called on Obama to take a harder line with BP , which has lost tens of billions of dollars in market value so far . \nBut senior British officials have warned about the economic impact of destabilizing a company that is a staple holding of British pension funds . \nIn a phone call on Saturday , Obama told British Prime Minister David Cameron he had no interest in undermining the value of BP and the two leaders played down tensions over the oil spill and reaffirmed close ties . \nCameron , who took office last month , is under pressure in Britain to do more to protect a company that accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by British companies . \nOn Tuesday , lawmakers hold a hearing in Washington with all the big oil companies including the head of BP 's U.S. operation . \nOn Thursday BP 's Hayward , who is expected to attend Wednesday 's White House meeting , will testify to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee . \nBP expects its cost for the Gulf oil clean-up to be $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion . \nMany analysts expect a higher cost . \nStates along the Gulf coast are increasingly demanding financial compensation from BP as the spill spreads along their shorelines , slamming tourism and fishing industries . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nApparently they own the politicians . \nIt 's up to us to dissuade these companies from gambling with the our quality of lives for a little extra profit . \nBP controls the crime scene , BP is now telling us how much the clean up will cost ? \nIf BP knows so much maybe they can bring the eleven men and 10,000 creatures back to life . \nOr maybe they should stop the leak . \nOr maybe they should be shown what 's what . \nAs usual , Obama has covered all the bases and done nothing . \nThis surely must be Bush 's fault Blaming Obama for this is precisely as reasonable as blaming the post war government in Germany after World War II for the destruction and economic crisis . \nThis is the result of conservative policies championed by Republicans . \nNo I have a better analogy , its like blaming the police after a rape ! \nWe could have weaned ourselves from oil decades ago but you Conservative Republicans have fought and cut the budget for alternatives every step of the way . \nNot only that its the Republicans who led the deregulation charge -- well here 's your result , a dead gulf of Mexico . \nThe fact that someone could even make an argument to the contrary shows either a total lack of objective reasoning or a cynical attempt to confuse the ignorant . \nHave you no shame ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1399", "time": "2010-06-14", "text": "NEW YORK | Mon Jun 14 , 2010 6:55 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Anadarko Petroleum shares have been pummeled because of the company 's link to the Gulf oil spill , but legal experts and some investors say it may not be liable for any of the billions of dollars of cleanup costs faced by BP Plc , its partner in the offshore well . \nAnadarko owns a 25 percent interest in the well that suffered the blowout on April 20 that caused an explosion at a drilling rig , killing 11 and creating the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe cost of the cleanup could run well into the tens of billions of dollars . \nWhile the contracts signed between partners in the development of oil wells call for each company to pay its proportional costs , BP , the operator of the well , could find itself footing the entire cleanup bill if Anadarko can prove the oil giant was negligent in drilling the well . \n`` The question is : is Anadarko going to be liable for cleanup costs , and I would say that 's the operator 's problem , '' said Michael Jones , adjunct professor of law at the South Texas College of Law . \nInvestors are starting to bet that Anadarko , whose shares have tumbled 43 percent , may not face the financial hit that BP is likely to experience . \nIt shares closed slightly higher on Monday at $ 42 , up about $ 7.50 from a year low on June 9 . \n`` There is every reason to believe that they will not be on the hook for more than the punitive cost of $ 75 million , '' said Keith Goddard , co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund , referring to statutory liability costs under current law . \nGoddard , whose firm recently bought 83,752 shares of Anadarko , said he believed the company could likely afford to pay its potential costs from the cleanup but still acknowledged there was a danger . \nFor buyers of Anadarko shares , `` it 's a reasonable risk-reward -- a very low probability of losing it all and a very high probability of making a lot of money in a short period of time , '' Goddard said . \nAnadarko has said only that it was assessing various remedies around the oil spill and did not comment on potential legal strategies . \nThe company 's role as solely a financial partner rather than as an operator of the well is key , if the issue were to go to trial , one lawyer said . \n`` Judges will take into account the fact that you have a completely innocent operator , '' Patrick Morris , a lawyer at the firm Johnson & Bell who represents oil companies in rig litigation . \n`` I think Anadarko 's defense could be pretty good , but it will take a long time '' for the issue to be settled . \nThe potential damage to the company if it is held responsible for a quarter of cleanup costs could be devastating . \n`` It hurts -LRB- Anadarko -RRB- more pound for pound , inch for inch , than it does for BP . \nAnything over $ 20 billion total cost is going to hit Anadarko pretty hard , '' said Fadel Gheit , analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. . \nThe odds that Anadarko will not face any liability could be too steep , he said . \n`` It 's a possibility , but I would n't want to make a bet on it , '' he added . \nThat fear could keep the Anadarko shares under pressure as wary investors seek more clarity into just how expensive the cleanup of the oil from the Gulf and the sensitive coastal shore will be . \n`` Anadarko is one of my favorite companies on the planet , but I do n't think you can own it until the spill is stopped . \nUntil you can actually stop it , the number just keeps going up , '' said Stephen Davis , associate portfolio manager at Alpine Mutual Funds . \nThat fear and the uncertain impact of regulations that may be implemented by the U.S. government to prevent future accidents have meant that methods typically used by Wall Street to evaluate companies ' stocks have little merit here . \n`` People thought Anadarko was cheap at $ 70 , $ 60 , $ 50 -LRB- a share -RRB- . \nThis is no longer a valuation call , '' Davis said . \n"}

'' \nMillions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig killed 11 workers and ruptured BP 's well . \nThe spill has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled a multibillion-dollar fishing industry and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins . \nObama , on his fourth visit to the Gulf Coast since the crisis began , said he would press BP executives at a White House meeting on Wednesday to deal `` justly , fairly and promptly '' with damage claims from the spill . \nIn New York , BP 's U.S.-listed shares tumbled 9.71 percent on investor concern the company may give in to calls by U.S. politicians to suspend its quarterly dividend . \nIn London , BP shares closed down 9.3 percent . \nUnder intense pressure from the Obama administration , BP unveiled a new plan on Monday to vastly boost the amount of oil it is siphoning off from its ruptured well . \nBut the leak will not be permanently sealed until BP finishes two relief wells that are due to be completed in August . \nBP said it planned to send more vessels to the spill site to increase its capacity to capture oil from 15,000 barrels a day now to 40,000-53 ,000 barrels by the end of this month and 60,000-80 ,000 by mid-July . \nIn a pivotal week in the 56-day-old crisis , Obama began a two-day visit to Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nHe will address the nation on Tuesday before meeting the BP executives on Wednesday for what a White House spokesman said would be a `` very frank '' encounter . \nAhead of congressional hearings on Tuesday and Thursday , lawmakers Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak released a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward that laid out a potentially damning account of the events leading up to the rig explosion . \n`` It appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk , '' their letter said . \nA BP spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment before the hearings . \nThe massive spill has overshadowed Obama 's political agenda , eclipsing job creation and Wall Street reform . \nBoth are key issues in November congressional elections in which Obama 's fellow Democrats are expected to face a tough fight to hold onto their majorities in both houses . \nFacing intense criticism that he has not shown enough leadership in the spill , Obama will seek to use his meeting with BP executives and his first nationally televised Oval Office speech to show he is on top of the crisis . \nBut Anthony Bourgeois , 62 , a seventh-generation commercial fisherman , said the situation was past the point where Obama 's words could quickly bring a quick solution . \n`` There ai n't much he can say . \nWe 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' he said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana . \nBP has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of the cleanup and last week was confronted with a White House threat to widen its liabilities for the disaster . \nThe company has lost more than 40 percent of its market value since the crisis began . \n`` The concern is that BP is going to cut its dividend and that 's weighing on the stock , '' said Andy Fitzpatrick , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates , in Hinsdale , Illinois . \nBP has hired investment banks Blackstone Group LP , Goldman Sachs Group LP and Credit Suisse Group AG as advisers , a source familiar with the matter said . \nThe source did not say what role the banks would play . \nInvestment bankers generally advise companies on corporate strategy , including mergers and acquisitions and financings . \nThe spill has created an unprecedented financial , legal , regulatory and environmental crisis for companies that operate in the Gulf of Mexico , Moody 's Investors Service warned in a report on Monday , saying it could be up to two years before oil production reaches pre-spill levels . \nThe Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico posed `` uncertainties that could last well beyond this date for producers , drillers and service companies operating in the region , '' Moody 's said . \nIn his meeting with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg on Wednesday , Obama will press for the company to set up an independently managed fund to pay oil spill damage claims . \nSpeaking in Theodore , Alabama , Obama said the White House was already talking to BP about the fund and hoped agreement on a framework for claims payments would be reached by Wednesday . \nGulf Coast residents have been complaining for weeks the BP claims process is too slow and that the money the company is paying out is too little to make ends meet . \nU.S. politicians have been calling on BP to scrap its quarterly dividend to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay the compensation claims and clean up the spill . \nBP executives will likely face renewed pressure to do this when they testify to Congress this week . \nRepresentatives of BP , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and ConocoPhillips are due to testify on Tuesday and may give the best view yet of how the industry expects the spill to affect it in the long term . \nBut analysts also expect the hearing to be full of drama . \n`` It 's going to be ugly for BP officials and there 's probably not going to be a lot gained from the experience , '' said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport , Connecticut . \nBP 's Hayward will make his first appearance at a congressional hearing on Thursday and is expected to face harsh questioning from lawmakers . \nAs chief executive , Hayward is the public face of BP 's response to the spill and a lightning rod for criticism that the company played down the scale of the disaster to reduce its potential liabilities . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant

'' \nBP investigators were unable to identify any single action or inaction that caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to blow up on April 20 , killing 11 workers , after the Macondo well ruptured . \n`` Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident , '' the report said . \n`` Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' \nInvestors had been eagerly awaiting the report to find out whether BP would be able to share the potential costs of the spill -- estimated by some analysts to exceed $ 50 billion . \nCitigroup analysts said in a research note that BP 's report `` appears to support the case for no negligence , '' but they acknowledged that the findings of the internal investigation were unlikely to be accepted as objective . \nBP shares trading in New York closed up 3.2 percent , while shares of Transocean were 1.3 percent higher and those of Halliburton were up 1.2 percent . \nStandard & Poor 's downgraded Transocean 's rating to BBB from BBB-plus , saying the Swiss-based company faced uncertain liabilities arising from the disaster . \nThe U.S. Justice Department could pursue a variety of civil and criminal charges against the companies involved in the spill . \nAny penalties could be in the billions of dollars . \nThe ruptured well unleashed a torrent of crude that spewed until it was capped three months later on July 15 , after 4.9 million barrels of oil had leaked into the sea . \nThe top U.S. official overseeing the spill response , retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , said on Wednesday that BP may not start the final `` kill '' of its well until mid - to late September . \nThe BP report , overseen by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that led to the blowout of the well and the subsequent explosion aboard the rig . \nIt defended BP 's much-criticized single-casing well design ; the use of fewer-than-recommended centralizers -LRB- devices used to ensure the cement casing is applied evenly around the well -RRB- ; and the decision to replace heavy drilling mud , which was keeping the well under control , with lighter water . \n`` It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident , '' said BP 's outgoing Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has faced withering criticism from U.S. lawmakers for initially playing down the scale of the disaster . \n`` HAPPY TO SLICE UP BLAME '' BP , which has seen almost $ 70 billion wiped off its market value since April 20 , is trying to rehabilitate its tarnished public image and restore investor confidence , spending millions of dollars on positive television and newspaper advertising . \n`` This report is not BP 's mea culpa , '' said Democratic congressman Edward Markey , an outspoken critic of BP 's handling of the disaster . \n`` Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one . \nBP is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece . '' \nEnergy industry analysts were also not convinced by the BP findings , noting its investigators did not have access to everyone who had been involved in the project . \n`` Make no mistake , our view remains that this is BP 's well , and BP is in charge of design and execution , '' Houston energy investment boutique Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said in a note . \nThe BP investigation found fault with Transocean employees aboard the rig at the time of the accident . \n`` Over a 40-minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well , '' BP said . \nBut Transocean said BP was seeking to conceal the key factor that led to the rig explosion -- the well design . \n`` In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk , '' it said . \nHalliburton joined Transocean in rejecting the findings , saying the BP report contained `` substantial omissions and inaccuracies '' and stressed it was fully indemnified for any allegations in the document . \nIn pointing the finger at its contractors , BP said : -- Halliburton had used an `` unstable '' cement mixture that allowed hydrocarbons to leak into the well . \n-- There was `` no indication '' that Transocean had tested the automatic shut-off function on the blowout preventer before it was used on the Deepwater Horizon rig . \n-LRB- Blowout preventers are designed to halt all oil and gas flow and contain pressure if there is an uncontrollable gush from a seabed well . -RRB- \n-- The rig crew diverted the flow of drilling mud and hydrocarbons into the wrong system after the blowout . \nThis meant gas vented onto the rig floor , rather than toward the sea , where it would have been less likely to cause a blast . \nTransocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said the blowout preventer was `` inspected , tested and went through a rigorous maintenance schedule prior to being placed on the Macondo well and was then tested weekly , right up until 72 hours prior to the blast . '' \n`` Any statement to the contrary is false , '' he said . \nThe damaged blowout preventer is key evidence in criminal and civil investigations of the blast . \nBP retrieved it from the seabed on Saturday under watch of federal investigators and it is being sent to a NASA facility in Louisiana . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nGet used to that phrase , you weasels . \nI 'm just waiting for them to hit the cap on damages congress approved and flee ! \nThank the U.S. Congress because they are really wonderful about protecting big business . \nI feel `` so very '' greatful and so should you ! \nI do n't know what us little people would do without all their `` help . '' \nBush , Obama , and Congress have been such a great blessing to America . \nOur future is so bright and life is just fine and dandy here . \nNever mind that oil gushed everywhere , we have been dumping billions into pointless wars for many years , unemployment is above 10 % in my state , the health system remains a mess , our schools are underfunded , and the infrastructure is corroding . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

'' \nSummer dead zones are common in shallower areas of the Gulf of Mexico , caused by run-off from farm chemicals flowing down the Mississippi River . \nDead zones have such low oxygen levels that most marine life -- including commercial important fish and shellfish -- can not survive , and scientists feared the BP spill would create such a zone in deep water around the Macondo wellhead after the April 20 blowout at the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nThat did not happen , Murawski said , and at this point is unlikely . \nHe said oxygen levels had hit a `` sweet spot , '' with microbes consuming enough of the dispersed oil to cause what he called a sag in oxygen , but not enough to cause a low-oxygen dead zone . \nPart of the spilled BP oil was broken up into tiny particles by chemical dispersants , which made it more palatable to petroleum-eating microbes , Murawski said . \n`` Has it hit a sweet spot ? \nWas it by design ? \nThe NOAA findings are in line with research presented by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . \nBoth of these institutions published articles in August noting the initial presence of an underwater plume of oil in the Gulf of Mexico and the disappearance of the oil when deep-water microbes efficiently ate it without giving off much oxygen . \nThe ruptured BP well had been secured with no threat of spewing crude . \nA cap on top of the failed blowout preventer at the Macondo well sealed in all oil flow since July 15 , and on Friday , the company replaced the failed equipment with a new giant stack of valves and pipes . \nOnce the new blowout preventer is tested , BP can resume drilling a relief well that will bore into the Macondo well , pump in mud and cement to plug it for good . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform \n"}

{"id": "1280", "time": "2010-11-04", "text": "HOUSTON | Thu Nov 4 , 2010 10:34 am EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc is headquartered at St. James 's Square in London , but the energy company 's fate lies in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico . \nThough the worst U.S. offshore oil spill has ravaged BP 's reputation and its stock price , BP will likely remain a top operator in the Gulf , a region which is key to future U.S. and global energy supplies . \nMore than six months after BP 's Macondo well ruptured and caused more than 4 million barrels of oil to spew into the sea , BP 's attention turns to scouring the oil-soaked shoreline and salvaging an image that has taken a beating from furious Gulf Coast residents and politicians . \nBP faces a barrage of civil and likely criminal prosecution from the U.S. government and hundreds of injured rig workers , but is unlikely to abandon the Gulf . \nThat 's because the U.S. government needs deep-pocketed energy companies like BP that can foot the soaring cost of drilling there , and BP needs access to the region 's reserves , which are some of the most profitable in its portfolio . \nBP 's new chief executive , American-born Bob Dudley , must defend his company 's turf in North America , home to nearly half of its global assets and its biggest earnings driver . \n`` I can promise you that I did not become chief executive of BP in order to walk away from the U.S. , '' Dudley said on October 25 in a defiant speech which criticized the media and industry rivals of stoking fears . \n`` BP will not be quitting America . '' \nIn its quarterly earnings statement on November 2 , BP raised its estimated cleanup costs by $ 7.7 billion to $ 40 billion . \n`` The path to rehabilitation post Macondo and Bob Dudley 's new strategic direction are the key to performance rather than Q3 earnings , '' analysts at Citigroup Global Markets said . \nInstitutional investors say BP can shoulder cleanup costs and the added expense of new offshore regulations . \nBut BP must convince sometimes skeptical officials that disasters like Macondo are in the past . \n`` Bob Dudley 's first priority is reestablishing BP 's credibility with the U.S. government and with various regulators so that BP can continue to operate in the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Will Riley , co-manager of the Guinness Global Energy Fund , which includes BP . \nIn the darkest days of the spill , U.S. politicians and even President Barack Obama referred to BP as `` British Petroleum , '' the now-defunct name the company carried from the 1950s until it merged with U.S.-based Amoco in 1998 to become BP Amoco , and then BP Plc in 2001 . \nBut BP is as American as apple pie -- or almost . \nAfter striking a major find in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay field in 1969 , BP grew its market share to be a top producer in the United States , for years the biggest global energy user until China supplanted it this year . \nSince the Amoco acquisition , `` BP is inextricably bound to the US energy industry , '' said Christopher Wheaton , portfolio manager at Allianz RCM Energy Fund , which owns BP shares . \nIn an era when U.S. politicians demonize foreign oil and extol the virtues of energy independence , BP plays a vital role as one of the biggest producers of home-grown U.S. crude oil and natural gas . \nBP is the biggest Gulf producer , accounting for about a quarter of the oil and natural gas output from a region that generates about a third of total U.S. domestic production . \n`` It 's not oil that Obama can turn his back on , '' Riley said . \nIt would also be hard for BP to walk away from the deepwater Gulf , which yields some of the most profitable barrels that it produces . \nAs a whole , the United States accounts for about 25 percent of BP 's upstream production , and about a third of its upstream profits , according to Citigroup . \nAs a result of several asset sales meant to generate cash to cover spill liabilities , BP 's reliance on Gulf operations will only rise . \nBP does n't have too many other expansion options apart from the Gulf , said Gary Adams , U.S. oil and gas leader at Deloitte , a consultancy . \nAnd major oil companies like BP , Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell will likely become more dominant in the deep waters of the Gulf . \nThat 's because they will be the only ones with enough money to cover new liability rules for deepwater drilling , which are likely to require companies to put up billions of dollars of collateral to cover potential future spill costs . \nFor a mid-sized independent like Apache Corp or Newfield Exploration Co , `` a $ 10 billion liability risk is a ` bet the company ' situation , and clearly that will discourage activity , '' Wheaton said . \nTo be sure , BP faces a barrage of civil and likely criminal prosecution from the U.S. government and hundreds of injured rig workers , and accusations from Macondo well partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp. of gross negligence in drilling the well , a claim that BP protests . \n`` It would clear the air enormously if BP could reach some agreement on the issue of gross negligence , '' said Ivor Pether , fund manager for Royal London Asset Management , which owns BP stock . \nA gross negligence finding could carry a $ 17.5 billion fine . \nAfter the Macondo disaster wiped about $ 70 billion from BP 's market value and forced it to temporarily suspend dividend payments , BP 's institutional investors see the company as undervalued versus other big oil companies . \n`` We ultimately come back to the numbers , which point to the fact that BP is cheap , '' Riley said . \nAnd even environmentalists concede that BP is in the Gulf to stay . \n`` BP is not going to be hounded out of the Gulf , '' said Elgie Holstein , a senior director at the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund . \n`` The reserves are too important .

'' \n`` BP will answer the government 's allegations in a timely manner and will continue to cooperate with all government investigations and inquiries , '' the company said . \nLegal experts have said they expect the two sides to settle eventually but it could take years . \nIn comparison , Exxon XOM . \nN -RRB- settled government claims over the spill by its Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1991 , two years after the oil hit the coast . \nThe lawsuit against BP and others warned that `` the full extent of potential injuries , destruction , loss and loss of services is not yet fully known and may not be fully known for many years . '' \nShares in the companies targeted in the lawsuit fell in the wake of the lawsuit . \nThe stocks trimmed early losses to close off their lows , with BP down 1.3 percent at $ 43.86 and Anadarko Petroleum down 2.3 percent at $ 67.41 . \nHalliburton , which was n't named in the suit , closed near session lows , down 3.1 percent at $ 39.79 . \nThe Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout spilled about 4.9 million barrels of oil over several months . \nIt fouled resort beaches and fishing grounds and led to hundreds of lawsuits over lost revenues and wages . \n`` This is about getting a fair deal for the region that suffered enormous consequences from this disaster , '' said Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency . \nThe lawsuit accused the companies of violating safety and operating regulations in the period leading up to the disaster , including keeping the well under control , failing to use the best available and safest drilling technology and failing to maintain continuous surveillance of the well . \nThe government claimed the companies violated the U.S. Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act , but the lawsuit does not request a specific dollar amount for damages . \nFor every barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , there could be a fine of up to $ 4,300 if gross negligence is found . \nThat would equal a fine of at least $ 21 billion . \nIf no gross negligence is found , the fine could be up to $ 1,100 per barrel or almost $ 5.4 billion . \nIt will be up to the judge to weigh the evidence presented in court to determine if the defendants were grossly negligent in their conduct , a Justice Department official said . \nThe Justice Department could also seek additional fines for harm to any animals protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , among other environmental laws . \nThe lawsuit did not name Halliburton , which did the cementing for the well , or Cameron International which provided well equipment , but Justice Department officials made it clear more defendants and charges could be added later . \nBP has taken responsibility for the cleanup but has questioned government estimates of how much oil came out of the well . \nBP co-owned the Macondo well with Anadarko and MOEX . \nAfter the lawsuit was filed , its partners said the blame and liability laid squarely on BP . \nAnadarko said it was not responsible for the decisions and operation for the well and therefore BP should be held responsible . \nTransocean , which drilled the well , also tried to pin the blame on BP . \n`` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator , '' Transocean said in a statement , adding it was `` indemnified in this matter . '' \nBP has estimated it may cost as much as $ 40 billion to pay for the spill , including the cleanup and penalties . \nThe London-based oil firm has been selling numerous assets to raise as much as $ 30 billion to cover those costs . \nThe Justice Department asked a federal judge in New Orleans overseeing the litigation to hold the companies liable , except for Lloyds , for unlimited damages , beyond the $ 75 million cap under the Oil Pollution Act . \nThe judge in Louisiana , Carl Barbier , has been overseeing the hundreds of private lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs against BP and its partners . \nHe has a status hearing set for Friday . \nA lawyer for private individuals suing BP over the spill said the new lawsuit by the Obama administration would not hurt their efforts . \n`` We look forward to continued cooperation with the U.S. government in pursuit of justice for all victims of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy , '' said the lawyer Steve Herman .

and then figure out what should we Americans do now that the truth is becoming to the surface for us to digest ... ... . \nA grim report circulating in the Kremlin today written by Russia s Northern Fleet is reporting that the United States has ordered a complete media blackout over North Korea s torpedoing of the giant Deepwater Horizon oil platform owned by the World s largest offshore drilling contractor that was built and financed by South Korea s Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. . \nLtd. , that has caused great loss of life , untold billions in economic damage to the South Korean economy , and an environmental catastrophe to the United States . \nMost important to understand about this latest attack by North Korea against its South Korean enemy is that under the existing laws of war it was a permissible action as they remain in a state of war against each other due to South Korea s refusal to sign the 1953 Armistice ending the Korean War . \nTo the attack itself , these reports continue , the North Korean cargo vessel Dai Hong Dan believed to be staffed by 17th Sniper Corps suicide troops left Cuba s Empresa Terminales Mambisas de La Habana -LRB- Port of Havana -RRB- on April 18th whereupon it severely deviated from its intended course for Venezuela s Puerto Cabello bringing it to within 209 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform which was located 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off the coast of the US State of Louisiana where it launched an SSC Sang-o Class Mini Submarine -LRB- Yugo class -RRB- estimated to have an operational range of 321 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- On the night of April 20th the North Korean Mini Submarine manned by these suicidal 17th Sniper Corps soldiers attacked the Deepwater Horizon with what are believed to be 2 incendiary torpedoes causing a massive explosion and resulting in 11 workers on this giant oil rig being killed outright . \nBarely 48 hours later , on April 22nd , this North Korean Mini Submarine committed its final atrocity by exploding itself directly beneath the Deepwater Horizon causing this $ 1 Billion oil rig to sink beneath the seas and marking 2010 s celebration of Earth Day with one of the largest environmental catastrophes our World has ever seen . \nTo the reason for North Korea attacking the Deepwater Horizon , these reports say , was to present US President Obama with an impossible dilemma prior to the opening of the United Nations Review Conference of the Parties to the Treat on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons -LRB- NPT -RRB- set to begin May 3rd in New York . \nThis impossible dilemma facing Obama is indeed real as the decision he is faced with is either to allow the continuation of this massive oil leak catastrophe to continue for months , or immediately stop it by the only known and proven means possible , the detonation of a thermonuclear device . \nRussian Navy atomic experts in these reports state that should Obama choose the nuclear option the most viable weapon at his disposal is the United States B83 -LRB- Mk-83 -RRB- strategic thermonuclear bomb having a variable yield -LRB- Low Kiloton Range to 1,200 Kilotons -RRB- which with its 12 foot length and 18 inch diameter , and weighing just over 2,400 pounds , is readily able to be deployed and detonated by a remote controlled mini-sub . \nShould Obama choose the nuclear option it appears that he would be supported by the International Court of Justice who on July 8 , 1996 issued an advisory opinion on the use of nuclear weapons stating that they could not conclude definitively on these weapons use in extreme circumstances or self defense . \nOn the other hand , if Obama chooses the nuclear option it would leave the UN s nuclear conference in shambles with every Nation in the World having oil rigs off their coasts demanding an equal right to atomic weapons to protect their environment from catastrophes too , including Iran . \nTo whatever decision Obama makes it remains a fact that with each passing hour this environmental catastrophe grows worse . \nAnd even though Obama has ordered military SWAT teams to protect other oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico from any further attack , and further ordered that all drilling in the Gulf of Mexico be immediately stopped , this massive oil spill has already reached the shores of America and with high waves and more bad weather forecast the likelihood of it being stopped from destroying thousands of miles of US coastland and wildlife appears unstoppable . \nAnd not just to the environmental catastrophe that is unfolding the only devastation to be wrecked upon the United States and South Korea by this North Korean attack as the economic liabilities associated with this disaster are estimated by these Russian reports to be between $ 500 Billion to $ 1.5 Trillion , and which only a declaration of this disaster being an act of war would free some the World s largest corporations from bankruptcy . \nImportant to note too in all of these events was that this was the second attack by North Korea on its South Korean enemy , and US ally , in a month as we had reported on in our March 28th report titled Obama Orders Immediate Stand-down After Deadly North Korean Attack and which to date neither the Americans or South Korea have retaliated for and giving one senior North Korean party leader the courage to openly state that the North Korean military took gratifying revenge on South Korea . \nAnd for those believing that things couldn t get worse , they couldn t be more mistaken as new reports coming from Japanese military sources are stating that North Korea is preparing for new launches of its 1,300 kilometer -LRB- 807 miles -RRB- intermediate range ballistic Rodong missile which Russian Space Forces experts state is able to deploy and detonate an atomic electromagnetic pulse -LRB- EMP -RRB- device , and which if detonated high in the atmosphere could effectively destroy the American economy for years , if not decades , to come . \nMay 1 , 2010 If what I found is true -LRB- previous comment -RRB- we Americans have been shafted along with many

{"id": "1254", "time": "2010-12-15", "text": "Wed , Dec 15 18:14 PM EST By Jeremy Pelofsky and James Vicini WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The Obama administration on Wednesday launched a legal battle against BP Plc and its partners by suing them for the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history , which could cost the companies billions of dollars . \nThe lawsuit seeks damages from the well owners BP , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co Ltd unit MOEX , and well driller Transocean Ltd and its insurer QBE Underwriting\\/Lloyd 's Syndicate 1036 , part of Lloyds of London , for their roles in the Gulf of Mexico disaster . \n`` While today 's civil action marks a critical step forward , it is not a final step , '' U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters at a news conference . \n`` Both our criminal and civil investigations are continuing , and our work to ensure that the American taxpayers are not forced to bear the costs of restoring the Gulf area -- and its economy -- goes on , '' he said . \nThe suit , the first by the U.S. government after the April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig in which 11 workers died , was filed in a New Orleans federal court which is considering private lawsuits against BP and the others for the spill . \nBP , which returned to profitability in the third quarter of 2010 , has begun selling assets and amassing a massive warchest to pay for damages caused by the oil spill , which the oil concern has estimated could reach as much as $ 40 billion . \nThe oil company said on Wednesday it was weighing the sale of its Canadian natural-gas liquids business . \nIn response to the lawsuit , BP said it is `` solely a statement of the government 's allegations and does not in any manner constitute any finding of liability or any judicial finding that the allegations have merit . '' \n`` BP will answer the government 's allegations in a timely manner and will continue to cooperate with all government investigations and inquiries , '' the company said . \nLegal experts have said they expect the two sides to settle eventually but it could take years . \nIn comparison , Exxon XOM . \nN -RRB- settled government claims over the spill by its Valdez tanker in Alaska in 1991 , two years after the oil hit the coast . \nThe lawsuit against BP and others warned that `` the full extent of potential injuries , destruction , loss and loss of services is not yet fully known and may not be fully known for many years . '' \nShares in the companies targeted in the lawsuit fell in the wake of the lawsuit . \nThe stocks trimmed early losses to close off their lows , with BP down 1.3 percent at $ 43.86 and Anadarko Petroleum down 2.3 percent at $ 67.41 . \nHalliburton , which was n't named in the suit , closed near session lows , down 3.1 percent at $ 39.79 . \nThe Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout spilled about 4.9 million barrels of oil over several months . \nIt fouled resort beaches and fishing grounds and led to hundreds of lawsuits over lost revenues and wages . \n`` This is about getting a fair deal for the region that suffered enormous consequences from this disaster , '' said Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency . \nThe lawsuit accused the companies of violating safety and operating regulations in the period leading up to the disaster , including keeping the well under control , failing to use the best available and safest drilling technology and failing to maintain continuous surveillance of the well . \nThe government claimed the companies violated the U.S. Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act , but the lawsuit does not request a specific dollar amount for damages . \nFor every barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico , there could be a fine of up to $ 4,300 if gross negligence is found . \nThat would equal a fine of at least $ 21 billion . \nIf no gross negligence is found , the fine could be up to $ 1,100 per barrel or almost $ 5.4 billion . \nIt will be up to the judge to weigh the evidence presented in court to determine if the defendants were grossly negligent in their conduct , a Justice Department official said . \nThe Justice Department could also seek additional fines for harm to any animals protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act , among other environmental laws . \nThe lawsuit did not name Halliburton , which did the cementing for the well , or Cameron International which provided well equipment , but Justice Department officials made it clear more defendants and charges could be added later . \nBP has taken responsibility for the cleanup but has questioned government estimates of how much oil came out of the well . \nBP co-owned the Macondo well with Anadarko and MOEX . \nAfter the lawsuit was filed , its partners said the blame and liability laid squarely on BP . \nAnadarko said it was not responsible for the decisions and operation for the well and therefore BP should be held responsible . \nTransocean , which drilled the well , also tried to pin the blame on BP . \n`` The responsibility for hydrocarbons discharged from a well lies solely with its owner and operator , '' Transocean said in a statement , adding it was `` indemnified in this matter . '' \nBP has estimated it may cost as much as $ 40 billion to pay for the spill , including the cleanup and penalties . \nThe London-based oil firm has been selling numerous assets to raise as much as $ 30 billion to cover those costs . \nThe Justice Department asked a federal judge in New Orleans overseeing the litigation to hold the companies liable , except for Lloyds , for unlimited damages , beyond the $ 75 million cap under the Oil Pollution Act . \nThe judge in Louisiana , Carl Barbier , has been overseeing the hundreds of private lawsuits involving thousands of plaintiffs against BP and its partners . \nHe has a status hearing set for Friday . \nA lawyer for private individuals suing BP over the spill said the new lawsuit by the Obama administration would not hurt their efforts . \n`` We look forward to continued cooperation with the U.S. government in pursuit of justice for all victims of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy , '' said the lawyer Steve Herman . '' \n-LRB- I -RRB- think it demonstrates confidence and momentum in the Court proceedings as we approach the February 2012 trial . '' \n"}
