BP 's name is so besmirched in DC that restoring its old Anglo - Iranian Oil Company moniker could hardly worsen things .
It 's partly political posturing , but there 's a real threat too .
Venezuelan - style expropriation may be a stretch , but Uncle Sam could still hurt the British oil giant badly .
The typically even - tempered President Barack Obama has talked about finding some ` ` ass to kick , '' and BP investors , who have sold off the company 's shares sharply , are right to worry .
Among the latest ideas aired by U.S. officials are making BP pay oil workers laid off as a result of the broad drilling moratorium imposed by the government , and forcing the company to suspend dividend payments .
Some of these proposals test the limits of the law .
But Uncle Sam has plenty of real sway over BP .
Until its Gulf of Mexico fiasco began <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="APPROX">nearly two months ago</TIMEX3> , BP held pole position in America 's oil industry .
Building on its late-<TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="199">1990s</TIMEX3> deals to buy Amoco and Atlantic Richfield , it had become the largest producer in federal waters in the Gulf .
With $ 2.2 billion of annual supply contracts , it is also the top fuel supplier to the American military .
Citigroup reckons nearly half BP 's value is , or was , attributable to its U.S. business .
Stripping BP of existing production leases may be difficult legally .
Once the oil starts to flow , these run in perpetuity and have very restricted termination clauses -- though lawyers in Houston are trawling for small print the government might invoke .
Perhaps more likely is to use BP 's lamentable safety record to bar it from future U.S. production .
While Exxon Mobil got religion on safety after the Valdez disaster <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> , BP seemingly did not .
Even after its lethal <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> Texas City refinery explosion , two BP refineries accounted for 829 , or 97 percent , of the 851 ` ` willful '' violations found by government safety inspectors in the U.S. refining industry between <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2007-06">June 2007</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-02">February this year</TIMEX3> , according to the Center for Public Integrity .
Then there are those Pentagon contracts , which must be at risk .
All this presents a long - term threat beyond the costs related to the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> disaster .
Despite BP 's financial strength , it may eventually make BP 's U.S. operations , and indeed the whole company , candidates for possible sale -- and associated name changes that just might consign memories of BP , as well as Iran , to the seabed .
The BP brand will certainly have to die in North America .
Otherwise the US government should pick out a number that they think BP could survive -LRB- without bankruptcy -RRB- .
Say it is $ 20 billion .
Then set up an escrow account and cap the liability at that amount .
Let the administrators of the escrow fund handle the inevitable swindles and lawsuits .
Let BP get on with the job of stopping the oil leak and building a new corporate culture .
Good presentation of the different choices except one thing that you fail to imagine : the qualification of a crime that could lead to hold BP CEO on the american territory and ask him for the famous caution to prepare freely his defense .
Obama is going to make a declaration in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">some hours</TIMEX3> .
` ` There ai n't much he can say .
We 're all commercial fishermen and we ca n't go out and make a living , '' he said in blazing heat in Venice , Louisiana .
BP has to go .
It 's very clear by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that this company cared nothing about the dangers of oil exploration\/production .
Once a hurricane picks up that oil , BP will be responsible for singlehandedly casting a blight across the Gulf states .
Perhaps even our eastern coastal states will suffer .
I ' m sure it will be the darkest , most unwelcome hurricane anyone has ever seen .
And to think that this destruction would be unleashed by a NATO ally .
Way to represent your country BP .
Get BP out of the picture and let our own expert salvage folks and engineers take over and get the job done .
There are many respected Americans in the field that understand the problem and can solve it given the resources .
Get them what they need .
And get BP out .
They are n't doing anything useful anyway .
Benny ...
where have you been ?
US experts and scientists as well as staff from all other major US oil firms are already providing advise to BP .
BP has mobilised all its available equipment to stop this leak and to reduce any damage by the already spilt oil .
If all these experts have n't already managed it do you think asking BP to leave is going to make it better ?
I am sure BP would be quite happy to just leave .
It would save them helluva a lot of hassle and money , but , no , they are responsible enough to stick it out there until the damage is reduced as far as possible .
One more thing ...
what 's the point of having a separate escrow account for claims to be administered by an independent US civil service agency .
BP has already been settling all claims on a 48 hr turn around time basis .
I doubt any government agency would be that quick !
