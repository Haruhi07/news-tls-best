BIRMINGHAM , Alabama | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-09-27">Sep 27 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-09-27T18:20">6:20 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BIRMINGHAM , Alabama -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Alabama expects to receive billions of dollars in penalties from BP Plc in the wake of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , a state commission said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-09-27">Monday</TIMEX3> .
BP and the White House will probably soon reach an agreement on how much money will be available to four Gulf states that have been affected by the spill , said the state Coastal Recovery Commission set up by Governor Bob Riley .
` ` While we do n't know the total or how it will be divided ... we have every reason to believe Alabama will suddenly have significant resources at its disposal , likely in the billions of dollars , '' the statement said .
The commission is charged with examining the impacts of the spill and recommending proposals to protect and enhance the coastline , Riley said in a separate statement .
Alabama has to ` ` make sure that the aftermath of this disaster is addressed and that we have a plan to fully recover what has been lost , '' said Ricky Matthews , publisher of the Mobile Press - Register newspaper and chairman of the commission .
` ` We have to understand what the issues are and how to handle them , '' he said in an interview .
The commission is due to meet on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-09-21">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Louisiana 's coastline bore the brunt of damage from the spill , which began on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> when a BP deepwater rig exploded and sank , unleashing millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
Alabama , Mississippi and Florida also sustained damage .
The spill ran until <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , when the well was capped .
BP <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-09">this month</TIMEX3> turned down Alabama 's claim for $ 148 million in lost government revenue because it said there was ongoing litigation over the issue .
The state 's attorney general , Troy King , accused the company of ` ` playing games '' with Alabama and other states on the Gulf of Mexico coast .
There is a growing dispute over how states , individuals and businesses should be compensated for losses suffered as a result of the spill .
BP has set up a $ 20 billion compensation fund administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg to handle claims but a plethora of lawsuits also have been filed against the company .
Alabama 's losses stem from diminished sales , lodging and fuel tax revenues as tourists avoided the state 's coast <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> because of the spill .
