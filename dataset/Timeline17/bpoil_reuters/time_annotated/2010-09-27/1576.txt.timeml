Al Gore 's lawyer seeks to lead BP oil spill cases WILMINGTON , Delaware | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-09-27">Sep 27 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-09-27T16:58">4:58 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WILMINGTON ,
Delaware -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A high - profile attorney who represented former Vice President Al Gore in the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> presidential election recount has made a surprise bid to lead the mammoth U.S. legal cases tied to the Gulf oil spill .
David Boies , a New York litigator , is entering a crowded field of plaintiffs ' lawyers also angling for a prime role in the lawsuits against BP Plc and other corporate defendants .
He has submitted an application for a seat on a committee that will oversee the cases , according to court documents .
Other applicants for committee seats include well - known plaintiffs ' attorney Mark Lanier of Texas , and California lawyers Elizabeth Cabraser , who battled Exxon Corp over the Valdez spill , and Thomas Girardi , who helped reach a settlement in a case made famous by the film ` ` Erin Brockovich . ''
` ` There 's a lot of money at stake , '' said Richard A. Nagareda , a professor at Vanderbilt Law School in Nashville , Tennessee .
` ` That 's why so many people are applying and why the appointment to the committee is so contentious . ''
Lawsuits have been filed around the country against BP and others as a result of the oil spill , the largest in U.S. history .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , many of these cases were consolidated in a federal court in New Orleans .
Judge Carl Barbier asked the lawyers who have brought lawsuits to submit applications for a seat on the committee .
A seat comes with the power to generate fee work for years and gives the attorneys the ability to shape the direction of the case .
The judge overseeing the case said he will consider an applicant 's willingness to commit to years of legal work , ability to work with others and experience in complex litigation .
Boies , chairman of law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner , championed Gore 's case in the Bush v Gore U.S. Supreme Court case in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> that catapulted George W. Bush to the White House .
He is also known for overseeing the U.S. Department of Justice 's antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. .
Boies , who applied to help lead the BP - related cases on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-09-24">Friday</TIMEX3> , did not immediately return a call for comment .
The judge said he would only consider applications from lawyers with cases before the court .
Boies described in his application the work his firm has done on the case , which includes touring docks and clean - up sites and talking to fishermen , deckhands , hotel owners , elected officials and the owner of an oyster - shucking plant .
Melissa Willett of Boies Schiller 's Washington office , who submitted the application for Boies , said the firm had cases pending in the oil spill litigation .
Boies 's arrival on the scene was not well - received by all attorneys .
` ` I ' m completely surprised , '' said Daniel Becnel , a Reserve , Louisiana , attorney who is well - known in Southern legal circles for his career fighting maritime lawsuits over spills and rig explosions .
` ` I do n't think lawyers in the South need someone to tell us what to do in an admiralty case since most of us have dealt with it for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> , '' said Becnel .
The case in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig ` ` Deepwater Horizon '' in the Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20 , 2010</TIMEX3> , No . 10 - MDL-2179 .
