Massive dome lowered at site of huge U.S. oil spill ROBERT , Louisiana | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">May 7 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-07T19:40">7:40 pm</TIMEX3> EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc engineers using undersea robots maneuvered a massive metal chamber to fit over a gushing ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> in their best chance yet to contain a leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe on U.S. shores .
The four - story structure , the best short - term hope of controlling the spewing crude , was lowered to the seabed almost one mile below the surface in an attempt to funnel the escaping oil to a surface tanker .
BP , which faces major financial losses from the spill , suffered a further blow when ratings agency Standard & Poor 's lowered its outlook on the British oil giant to negative from stable .
It is under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage from what could be the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
BP has said it will pay all legitimate costs , a bill that is likely to run into the billions of dollars .
BP officials hope the container will begin funneling oil from the leak <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-W19">next week</TIMEX3> .
Workers will spend the next <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> making the connections to pump crude to the surface .
The device has not been tried at that depth , where engineers guiding remotely operated vehicles battle darkness , currents and intense undersea pressure .
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward warned there was no certainty of success .
` ` The pressures and temperatures are very different here , so we can not be confident that it will work , '' Hayward told CNN .
BP is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to three months</TIMEX3> to complete .
Engineers have also considered pumping heavy fluids into the top of the failed blowout preventer to plug the leaking well in a technique called ` ` top kill . ''
They gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said .
Surface containment efforts continue , helped by calm seas .
Controlled burns on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> removed up to 9,000 barrels -LRB- 280,000 gallons\/1 , 070,000 liters -RRB- of oil , he said .
It ` ` is a very powerful technique and when the weather is good it will continue , '' Suttles said .
Forecasts suggest light winds through <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-01">Saturday</TIMEX3> , although they are expected shift and come from the south to southwest , which could push the slick toward the Louisiana shore .
About 250 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Crews have laid almost 800,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> , after meeting with BP executives in Houston , U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the company and its partners made ` ` some very major mistakes . ''
Salazar reiterated the U.S. government will issue no new offshore drilling permits until an inter - agency panel gives a safety review to President Barack Obama by <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3> .
In the meantime , <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> drilling will continue .
Standard & Poor 's , in announcing the negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely .
Moody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project .
S&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill - fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is ` ` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean - up . ''
Other companies involved are Transocean , owner of the rig that caught fire and collapsed ; Cameron International , which supplied the failed blow - out preventer for the well ; and Halliburton , which helped cement in place the blown - out well .
Hayward a $ 75 million legal cap on its cleanup and compensation liabilities under federal law , which some U.S. lawmakers <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> want to raise , would not be a limit for BP .
BP shares dropped 2.3 percent in London on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> , less than the broad STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index which fell 3.8 percent .
In New York , BP 's American Depository Receipts sank 2.7 percent .
The spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster on tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
It has forced Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling .
At least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\/795 , 000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> since the well ruptured .
A sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land .
Some oiled birds have been found in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
The Breton refuge was closed to the public after a silver sheen and emulsified oil reached the shoreline , the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said .
Altogether , crude from the spill could hit 24 national wildlife refuges .
A Reuters photographer , on a flyover of the coast , saw a band of oil , orange in color and about a mile or two long , running parallel to shore about 17 miles south of barrier islands off Mississippi 's mainland .
Numerous black blobs , possibly emulsified tar , were visible just below the surface in shallow water near some marsh coast to the east of the Chandeleur Islands .
U.S. authorities on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> modified and expanded the boundaries of the area closed to fishing as a result of the spill , and extended restrictions for another <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> , to <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-05-17">May 17</TIMEX3> .
The closed area represents almost 4.5 percent of Gulf of Mexico federal waters , up from slightly less than 3 percent included in the original ban .
` ` This oil spill was the last thing we needed , '' Lance Nacio , a shrimper with Anna Marie Seafood in Dulac , Louisiana , said on a call with reporters .
` ` I think this is going to devastate the industry which was already tattered by low dockside prices . ''
Kevin Begos , a seafood industry spokesman in Apalachicola , Florida , said dealers in his area have seen orders drop .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Right now</TIMEX3> , it 's mostly fear , because oil has n't come here yet , '' Begos said .
Alabama tourism officials planned an ad campaign to let tourists know the beaches were still clean and encourage them not to cancel their vacation plans .
Fears of massive shipping problems in the Gulf of Mexico have not panned out .
Shippers and ports are prepared to clean vessels that move through the oily waters , but so far ships have passed through without contamination .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
I hope that is a special place in hell for corrupt corporations .
