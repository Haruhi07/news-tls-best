BP pledges Gulf of Mexico oil fields to spill fund LONDON | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Oct 1 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-10-01T16:52">4:52 pm</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - BP , which faces U.S. opposition to drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico , named fields there that it will use to help finance its $ 20 billion fund for victims of the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
The oil major on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> said it would channel revenue from a number of its fields in the Gulf , including Thunder Horse , Atlantis and Mad Dog , into its compensation fund .
` ` It 's quite a clever thing that BP 's done which is , here are our deep water Gulf of Mexico assets , and we 're pledging overriding royalties as collateral which should suggest to the U.S. administration not to in any way meddle with these facilities , '' said Seymour Pierce analyst Alan Sinclair .
There have been concerns that the U.S. could ban BP from future drilling after lawmakers in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> voted to pass an amendment to a bill that would prevent BP from acquiring new exploration leases after the blow - out at its Macondo well in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> .
A BP spokesman declined to comment on whether the move means the U.S. government has told BP , or the company expects , it will not be banned from future drilling .
Shares in BP gained 2.9 percent to 440 pence at <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-10-01T07:02">7:02 a.m.</TIMEX3> EDT on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> , their highest level since <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="START">early June</TIMEX3> , outperforming Britain 's blue - chip index , which was up 0.6 percent and slightly ahead of the European index of oil and gas companies which was up 2 percent .
Another analyst , who did not wish to be named , noted that BP is planning to sell $ 30 billion of assets and said the deal between Chinese refiner Sinopec and Spanish oil major Repsol , announced earlier could be driving market optimism on asset prices .
` ` Repsol 's got a very good price for some of its assets <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">today</TIMEX3>
so maybe people are getting hopeful on that , '' he said .
BP also said on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">Friday</TIMEX3> that the total bill for fighting the spill and compensating victims hit $ 11.2 billion by <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-09-29">September 29</TIMEX3> , rising from $ 9.5 billion on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-09-18">September 18</TIMEX3> .
The pledging of the assets is in line with the terms of the fund set out in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , when BP agreed to give the fund first priority to some oil revenues to finance its $ 5 billion contribution <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> and the $ 1.25 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="SET" value="P1Q" quant="EVERY">every quarter</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2013">2013</TIMEX3> .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
The US Government wo nt ' let them drill , making the Gulf leases worthless .
Pledge the assets of the <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> worthless leases against the claims funds .
BP gets to write off the worthless leases against earnings , and does n't end up paying the claims because the ` ` assets '' of those leases are pledge against them .
Score - BP : 1 , US Government : 0
Ah , the US government .
Never a better group of Telfon Warriors have I seen .
When things are going bad in the US , look for the nearest foreign government or business to blame .
Take China and the Yuan as the latest in a long series of perfect pass off 's .
@bobw111 : your type continues to annoy me .
If BP wanted to ` avoid ' paying anything , they could do so very easily .
BP 's US business is seperate from the rest of the Group .
Therefore , if the Group -LRB- yes , the Group being the British owned , operated and managed entity -RRB- wanted to , they could quite simply stop funding the US business and leave it to fund and fight for itself from its own assets .
It is a simple thing that every large corporation does -- it is called a Corporate Veil and it seperates business units , allowing Groups to 's eperate ' business units that it may need to .
Therefore your comments are completely inane .
If BP wanted to , it would be too easy for them to not sell any assets and leave the US business to fund the entire GOM situation from the revenue of their assets .
This would obviously lead to bankruptcy of the US business which employes over 30,000 American 's and is owned primarily by American 's as it is listed on the NYSE .
Suggest you look to support a constructive solution whereby the UK based Group supports the US business .
Lest you wish to add to the unemployment lines and double dipping of your economy .
