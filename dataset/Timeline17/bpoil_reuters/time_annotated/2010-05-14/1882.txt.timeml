HOUSTON\/PORT FOURCHON , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -- BP on <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> geared up for its latest attempt to control a gushing undersea well as environmentalists complained they were being kept in the dark about the oil spill 's potential ecological impact .
BP Plc , the British energy giant , said it would deploy a small containment dome , known as a ` ` top hat , '' soon to trap the oil at the site of the leak a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico .

A natural gas cloud enveloped a Gulf of Mexico offshore oil rig leased by BP Plc < BP.L > and exploded just as visiting BP officials were celebrating seven accident - free years in the rig 's crew quarters , according to accounts by survivors of the accident .
Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> he obtained transcripts of interviews from three rig workers familiar with the explosion , including two who were in the rig 's crew quarters at the time .

For Louisiana 's young Republican governor , a massive oil spill lurking off his state 's fragile coast is another chance to show his skills as a detail - oriented manager and position himself for the national political stage .
State political experts say Bobby Jindal , the 38 - year - old son of Indian immigrants , is maneuvering for a possible run against Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2014">2014</TIMEX3> .
Jindal has dismissed such speculation and insists he is focused on getting re - elected in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .

The outer edge of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico washed up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana coast on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-14">Friday</TIMEX3> , as efforts redoubled to avert what could become one of the worst U.S. ecological disasters .
The last flight by a Coast Guard plane on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> had situated the thin surface ` ` rainbow sheen '' of the slick just 10 metres -LRB- 33 feet -RRB- from the Pass - a - Loutre wildlife reserve in Louisiana .
It seemed inevitable that some of the oil would reach shore , although the Coast Guard was awaiting information from its first <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-05-14TMO">Friday morning</TIMEX3> flight , a spokesman said .

The U.S. government ratcheted up efforts to avert an environmental disaster as a massive oil slick leaking from a ruptured well moved closer to the mouth of the Mississippi River on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> , menacing the delicate coastline of Louisiana and three other Gulf states .

A massive oil slick from a blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach a wildlife reserve at the mouth of the Mississippi River on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> as it threatens the environmentally delicate coastline of Louisiana and three other Southern U.S. states .
President Barack Obama pledged to ` ` use every single available resource '' -- including the U.S. military -- to help the London - based energy giant BP Plc fight the crude oil spill , which was about 3 miles from the marshes of the Mississippi Delta and spreading faster than expected toward the shoreline , according to the Coast Guard .

A massive oil spill expected to hit the southern U.S. coast on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-14">Friday</TIMEX3> could affect petroleum shipments and delay plans to open up coastal waters to more drilling , government officials said on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
The spill -- from a BP Plc < BP.L > rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W18">last week</TIMEX3> -- is spewing five times more oil than previously estimated and raising fears of severe damage to fisheries , wildlife refuges and beaches in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
` ` This is a spill of national significance , '' Janet Napolitano , the secretary of Homeland Security , told a news conference at the White House .
` ` We will continue to push BP to engage in the strongest response possible . ''
The governor of Louisiana , which is still recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Katrina in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , declared a state of emergency and the U.S. military said it was reviewing how it might help the efforts to contain the growing slick .
Shares in London - based BP and Swiss - based rig company Transocean Ltd < RIGN.S > < RIG.N > fell by more than 6 percent on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> as investors feared a significantly higher cleanup cost .
BP is down more than 10 percent and Transocean is down nearly 14 percent since the rig explosion on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .
Shares of oilfield services companies Cameron International Corp < CAM.N > and Halliburton Co < HAL.N > tumbled on fears about their ties to the Deepwater Horizon rig .
Cameron , which supplied the blowout preventer for the rig , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">Thursday</TIMEX3> it was insured for $ 500 million of liability , if needed .
Halliburton said it did a variety of work on the rig and was assisting with the investigation .
The slick will hit the coast in the Mississippi Delta ` ` sometime <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-05-15" mod="END">later tomorrow</TIMEX3> , '' Sally Brice OHare , rear admiral of the Coast Guard , said at the news conference with Napolitano .
President Barack Obama said BP was ultimately responsible for the cost of the cleanup and that his government would use every resource to address the spill .
The White House said Obama has been briefed on how the slick may interfere with shipping channels , which could affect tankers delivering petroleum to the U.S. market .
It may also have ramifications for proposals in Congress and by Obama to issue new offshore drilling permits .
Initial indications were that the spill would be worse than one in the Pacific Ocean off Santa Barbara in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="1969">1969</TIMEX3> which prompted a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts , a ban Obama has said he wants to modify .
The Obama administration did not rule out imposing a pause in new deepwater drilling until oil companies can show they can control any spills that may happen .
` ` Everything is on the table , '' Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes told reporters , adding it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> to install a relief valve to stop the leak .
Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the rig disaster , the worst in the United States in <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="LESS_THAN">almost a decade</TIMEX3> .
Transocean 's Deepwater Horizon rig sank on <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">April 22</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after it exploded and caught fire while the company was finishing a well for BP about 40 miles -LRB- 64 km -RRB- southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River .
The daily leak from the well blowout is <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> estimated at 5,000 barrels or about 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 litres -RRB- .
The Navy said it was supplying the Coast Guard with inflatable booms and seven skimming systems .
BP and the Coast Guard have mounted what the company calls the largest oil spill containment operation in history , involving dozens of ships and aircraft .
But they are struggling to control the slick from the leaking well 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metres -RRB- under the sea off Louisiana 's coast .
After underwater robots failed to activate a cutoff valve to stop the leak , BP and the Coast Guard set a ` ` controlled burn '' on <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2010-05-12">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to try to prevent the slick from growing .
` ` We will not rest until we have done everything to bring this under control , '' said Andrew Gowers , head of group media for BP , likening the spill 's consistency to ` ` iced tea '' with the thickness of a human hair .
` ` Chris has been a journalist for Reuters since <TIMEX3 tid="t47" type="DATE" value="2001">2001</TIMEX3> , when he joined the Washington DC bureau as a <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> intern .
As a correspondent in Washington , Chris covered energy policy , reported on Congress , the Supreme Court and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency .
