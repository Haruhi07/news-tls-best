- <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">Last month</TIMEX3> s explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig continues to result in the leakage of an estimated 200,000 gallons -LRB- 910,000 litres -RRB- of oil into the Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
According to U.S. President Barack Obama , we are dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster .
While the leak is extremely serious , and Obama s words may ultimately ring true , the leak is -LRB- as yet -RRB- not one of the top 50 biggest oil spillages from either oil rigs or tankers in historical perspective : cents Some 7 - 10 , 000 tonnes of oil are so far estimated to have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico from Deepwater Horizon .

The Exxon Valdez leaked some 36,000 tonnes of crude oil on the shores of Alaska .

The largest ever off - shore leakage of oil occurred in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1979">1979</TIMEX3> in the Ixtoc-1 spillage when an estimated 476,000 tonnes of oil polluted the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- Bay of Campeche -RRB- .
cents
The biggest ever on - shore spillage occurred in the aftermath of the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> Iraq War when an estimated 1.4 to 1.5 million tonnes was released in Kuwait by Iraqi military forces .
Most at risk from the Deepwater Horizon spill are the coastlines of Texas , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , and Louisiana , including the wetlands near New Orleans where millions of migratory birds are <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> nesting , and fish spawning .
The oil spill could also be catastrophic for the Gulf Coast s substantial seafood industry , including oysters and shrimp .
To mitigate the environmental impact , measures will continue to be taken to prevent as much of the oil as possible reaching the shoreline , including setting fires to burn - off the oil ; soaking up the oil ; and placing protective barriers around shorelines .
The precise scale of the unfolding disaster remains uncertain owing to the lack of clarity over how long the leak will last .
In the worst - case scenario , as U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has suggested , the leak could continue for several more months .
Uncertainty is also increased by the fact that BP executives are reported to have admitted to members of the U.S. Congress that the amount of oil spilling could intensify -- perhaps by several multiples of the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> leakage per day -- if they can not cap the flow .
Hopes for a relatively early end to the leakage are resting largely upon the success of the operation to install a five - storey , 100 tonne containment dome .
The device was to be lowered by cranes around 1500 metres to the sea floor and , if possible , positioned over the two areas of leaking pipe .
If successful , the dome would serve as a giant funnel , collecting and piping it for collection on the sea surface .
However , this operation has only been applied at a much smaller water depth and the first attempt to employ the device here has not been successful .
Even if successful , the dome will not stem all of the leakage -LRB- perhaps 80 - 90 percent of it -RRB-
and there remains a risk of explosion when the oil reaches the surface because of the volatile mix of oil , gas and water .
Thus , the operation can only be a holding one to buy time until the spillage can be shut off at the two remaining sources of the leak .
While shutting off the leakage at source will be an immensely difficult task , hopes will have been raised <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W18">last week</TIMEX3> by the fact that BP successfully shut off the smallest of the three original leakages .
This was done by placing a valve over the ruptured pipe and shutting it off using a remotely controlled submarine .
The best hope of shutting off the two remaining sources of leakage is getting the blow - out preventor working again .
This is the system , which should act as an emergency cut - off to stop oil continually spilling out if a pipe is damaged , and which failed catastrophically <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04">last month</TIMEX3> .
However , the blow - out preventor is proving immensely hard to fix , in large part because of the exceptional depth of the water .
Hopes rest largely upon robot submarines re - starting the system .
In the event that the blow - out preventor can not be fixed , relief wells have begun to be drilled that could be used to siphon off the oil leaking from the holed pipeline .
This operation will take an estimated <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2M">two</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> as the drilling is taking place at 1500 metres water depth and a further 5 kilometres into the hard rock .
The relief well can also be drilled such that the shaft of the new well enters into the shaft of the existing , problematic well .
A cement prop can then be inserted to stop the flow in the first well .
This requires extremely accurate drilling , but that technique has been proven before .
Inevitably , all of this environmental mitigation and emergency replacement activity is proving extremely expensive .
The cost of operations to BP alone is an estimated 6 million dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , and independent estimates have put the final bill at between 3 billion and 12 billion dollars .
However , the effects of this accident can not be expressed in money terms alone , because of the growing scale of the environmental disaster if the oil spill can not be contained soon .
Once the crisis is over , industry and government will need to make an urgent in - depth analysis of the cause of the accident to ensure that similar incidents can never happen again .

The Canadian oil sands can finally officially pass the crown Dirty oil off to their rightful owners the offshore producers and shippers .
Oil sands can provide clean and environmentally friendly oil to the world for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P100Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over a hundred years</TIMEX3> .

This without bringing the hurt and pain to environmentally sensitive regions that do not deserve this again .
It s unfortunate that this needed to happen for the world to wake up that an endless supply is located onshore .
I submitted an idea to BP <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">a few days ago</TIMEX3> which I believe will work , to stop the leak .
They already have a 78 ton metal box which they can put on top of the leak on the ocean floor .
I suggest they start vacuuming mud off the sea bed and dumping the mud on top of the box .
Eventually , the mud will build up a large roughly conical mound on top of , and around , the box and leak .
The weight of the mud bearing down on the box will seal it effectively against the sea bed .
The sheer mass of mud will counteract the overpressure of the oil from the well .
The relief well <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> being drilled will eventually remove the oil overpressure , so the mud can then be removed by pumps and the leak sealed in a more permanent fashion .
Everyone is worried about the oil coming up uncontrolled from the sea bed .
The biggest worrier I have seen so far is BP .
Sure they are losing millions because of this oil floating up and kill fish and wildlife daily .
They are also spending millions , without comment about how much money they are spending or for that matter losing on this one site .
I 'll bet you that 99.9 % of the population worried about this pollution are still buying fuel for their cars .
Of those I 'd guess that about 50 % of these go to any other company that is not BP .

Yes I can see everyone being mad and worried about this problem happening , I would just see that the support of BP while it is happening a good idea .
Sure if you wish , go to another oil company when the problem is fixed .
Unfortunately , I am the occupant of an electric wheel chair <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P7D">7 days</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
If I was still able to drive a vechile on the roads , until this problem is solved , I would gladly by my fuel from BP to make a donation so they can clean up ASAP .
If its not a blow by or fear for a blow by , its rather simple to replace the so called failing BOP .
<TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="1990">20 years ago</TIMEX3> I presented my company a concept of an equipment to replace a failing BOP .
Any way , <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="1983">27 years ago</TIMEX3> I presented the oil majors Shell , Exxon and BP a concept for oil drilling ; cheaper , faster and safer .
Most major advances in oil drilling of <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P25Y">the last 25 years</TIMEX3> were included in that concept ; coiled , monodiameter , underbalanced , snake .
So to my opinion the oil spill is a result of rather clumsy operations .
