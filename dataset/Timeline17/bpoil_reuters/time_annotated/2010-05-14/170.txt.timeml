NEW YORK | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-14">May 14 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-05-14T17:42">5:42 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - BP 's oil spill could make for one of the highest - stakes U.S. Gulf hurricane seasons on record .
Storms may scuttle clean - up efforts , force containment vessels to retreat , or propel spilled crude and tar balls over vast expanses of sea and beach , scientists said .
Meteorologists say that climate conditions are ripe for an unusually destructive hurricane season , the storm - prone period that runs from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-11" mod="END">the end of November</TIMEX3> in the Gulf .
Oceanographers say that could hurt the clean - up .
` ` If a storm comes into this situation it could vastly complicate everything , '' said Florida State University oceanography professor Ian MacDonald .
` ` All efforts on the shoreline and at sea , the booms and structures and rigs involved in clean - up and containment , could stop working . ''
As thousands of spill responders gird for a clean - up that could last for months or years after the leaking well is capped , weather and ocean currents are emerging as major unknowns , raising anxiety levels , economic and environmental stakes in the Gulf as storm season nears .
Compounding the uncertainty is how little research has been done on how storms affect oil spills .
Some believe storm surges may help disperse the oil off shore or break down the slick .
Other research suggests the oil slick itself could keep storms from gathering strength .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">Recent</TIMEX3> Atlantic Basin readings showed water temperatures up to 0.8 degrees Celsius above normal , and near a record high for the season .
El Nino , which creates wind shear that can prevent Gulf hurricanes from forming , has <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> subsided .
The factors could spur major storms in the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
` ` It only takes one storm to wreak havoc , '' said Chris Shabbot , a meteorologist at Sempra in Connecticut .
` ` The consensus forecast is for above average storm activity as the El Nino -LRB- event -RRB- decays and the Atlantic is as warm or warmer than <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> . ''
Colorado State University 's renowned team of forecasters is calling for an above - average hurricane season that may bring 15 named storms <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> , eight of hurricane strength .
Accuweather 's Joe Bastardi also fears a destructive season .
` ` I hate to say it since the oil spill is already affecting people , but I think this hurricane season is going to be big , '' he said in an interview .
The next official hurricane season outlook from the government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is due on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">May 20</TIMEX3> .
Miles and miles of booms have been placed offshore along the Gulf Coast to help stop the slick from making landfall .
Amid the menacing forecasts , oceanographers and spill - responders are considering how storms and deep ocean currents would affect the movement of spilled oil , which authorities say could soon hit land in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama or Florida .
The U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico spans some 1,680 miles .
The spill , gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> from a subsea oil well 50 miles south of Louisiana , has formed a thin oil slick that covered more than 1,200 square miles in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , according to Louisiana State University researchers .
The slick has been harder to define <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-05">this month</TIMEX3> , and may be shrinking , LSU professor Nan Walker said .
Lurking under the sea surface , viscous tar balls are forming , facilitated by wave activity , as the heavier hydrocarbon molecules gradually sink toward the sea - floor , a process that can take months , scientists said .
Experts are having trouble modeling how the oil will react in water since BP has n't disclosed exactly what kind of crude is spilling .
Lighter oil evaporates quicker and is more easily dispersed by chemicals .
Heavier crude can be more damaging to marine or bird life , but it could sink faster or be easier to contain .
As many as 520 vessels are already responding to the spill throughout the Gulf , according to U.S. authorities .
Efforts to stop the spill involve drilling relief wells from a seaborne rig , which BP says could take <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
The company is also trying to cap the leak with a metal funnel on the sea - floor , to gather oil into a giant hose connected to a storage ship above .
Both of those efforts could be disrupted by tropical storms , which can force evacuation of oil and gas rigs throughout the Gulf .
Peter Niiler , an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution in San Diego , has researched how even winds caused by a low pressure cycle can displace floating scientific buoys from waters near Florida to Texas in <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="LESS_THAN">less than a week</TIMEX3> .
` ` Anything on the ocean surface , including oil , can move very fast and just about anywhere that wind or currents push it , '' Niiler said .
The oil slick might even reach waters and shores abroad , scientists and foreign authorities warned <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010-W19">this week</TIMEX3> .
Mexican officials say if the spill persists into the fall it could reach Mexican beaches along the country 's Gulf Coast , the site of famed tourist destinations like Cancun .
Some of the spilled crude should make its way into the LOOP <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> , a deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream .
` ` If you look at it , the LOOP <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> could lead that oil right to Havana , Cuba , '' said Florida State 's MacDonald .
After sweeping near Havana , the LOOP <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> continues toward the Florida Keys and the Gulf Stream heads up the U.S.
Eastern Seaboard .
Some researchers said a wider dispersion of the spill may be good , and storms could help that process along .
Researchers at NOAA , in a report <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2010-W18">last week</TIMEX3> , said the oil slick may also help to impede storm formation by preventing heat transfer from sea to air .
` ` There are two important issues here : the effect of hurricanes on the spill , and the effect of the spill on hurricanes , '' said Doron Nof , professor of oceanography at Florida State University .
` ` I think what a hurricane would do is break up the oil spill , making it even harder to clean up , '' he said .

This simple technique using locally available hay and straw will at least bind up the floating oil and keep it from fouling shorelines .
