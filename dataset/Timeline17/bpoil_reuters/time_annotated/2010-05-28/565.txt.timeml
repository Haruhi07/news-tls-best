Cuban coast a major breeding ground for marine species \ * Concern that Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> could carry oil to Cuba \ * Cuba open to cooperation with U.S. against spill HAVANA , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3>
-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Red flags went up on beaches in western Cuban <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> , closing them briefly to swimmers amid rumors that the BP oil spill in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico was forcing sharks into Cuban waters .
The government , through state - run press , quickly denounced the rumors as false and the beaches were reopened , but the incident reflected fears that the massive spill will reach Cuba and wreak havoc on an island still relatively untouched by modernity 's environmental ills .
` ` Cuba , like all the countries in this area , is worried about the situation in the Gulf , '' said Osmani Borrego Fernandez , a director at the Guanahacabibes National Park at Cuba 's western tip .
So far , he said , there has been no evidence of the oil , but ` ` we are alert . ''
A trip along Cuba 's coastline is like a trip back in time where vast stretches of palm - fringed beaches sit undeveloped and sea life abounds in the crystalline waters .
While rampant development and overfishing have damaged coastlines and depleted seas around the world , communist - led Cuba has been largely preserved by its slow economic pace .
As a result , scientists and environmentalists view Cuban waters as a place where they can see how the world 's oceans were decades ago .
` ` Many areas along the coast , and thousands of small keys , are in rural areas or are remote and have simply been left alone , '' said Dan Whittle , senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund .
` ` Ernest Hemingway set up a fish camp on Cayo Paraiso -LRB- about 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- west of Havana -RRB- in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="194">the 1940s</TIMEX3> and the area has not really changed since then .
If he were still alive , he 'd still recognize it <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">today</TIMEX3> , '' he said of the U.S. writer who lived in Cuba for <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2DE">two decades</TIMEX3> .
Cuba 's northwest coast is considered most in danger from the oil .
It is there that coral reefs , seagrass beds and mangroves provide major breeding grounds for many fish and sea creatures , including endangered migratory species like sea turtles , sharks and manatees , Whittle said .
All that is at stake if the BP oil finds its way to Cuba .
It could also damage Cuba 's tourism industry , which is centered on beaches and to a lesser degree eco - tourism .
Tourism brought in more than $ 2 billion to Cuba <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> , or about 20 percent of Cuban 's foreign exchange income .
The good news for Cuba is that the spill is still centered about 300 miles -LRB- 483 km -RRB- northwest of the island and BP may finally be gaining control over the massive leak .
Officials for the oil giant said on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> their so - called ` ` top kill '' solution of plugging the gusher by pumping in ` ` drilling mud '' was showing signs of success .
But even if that happens soon , Cuban officials are concerned that the oil already in the water could be swept south by gulf currents .
Cuba is separated from the Florida Keys by just 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- of water and despite their disparate political histories , the United States and Cuba are inextricably linked ecologically .
Another rumor that supposedly contributed to the Cuban beach closures <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> was that lionfish , which have venomous spikes and have invaded Cuban waters in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> from Florida , were poisoning swimmers .
The government said that rumor also was false .
The United States and Cuba have been at odds since Fidel Castro took power in a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="1959">1959</TIMEX3> revolution , but they held talks <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W20">last week</TIMEX3> about the oil slick , officials said .
Cuba expert Wayne Smith at the Center for International Policy think tank in Washington said he met with Cuban authorities <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> in Havana and that they are ` ` fully open '' to cooperation with the Americans to stop the oil .
Standing in the way is the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba , which prevents the use of much U.S. technology in Cuba .
At a conference <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> in Washington , oil experts and environmentalists said it was time to allow cooperation with Cuba in oil safety practices .
` ` We are not talking about a transfer of technology .
All we are asking is that , if there is an accident , the Cubans can pick up the phone and call American experts who can bring resources within <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> , '' said oil expert Jorge Pinon .
The issue is becoming a bigger one as Spanish oil giant Repsol -LRB- REP .
MC -RRB- REP .
N prepares to drill for oil off Cuba 's ecologically rich northwest coast perhaps <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3> .
It has contracted for use of an Italian - owned drilling rig <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being completed in China .
While the spill is a disaster , it might have one positive result , Smith said .
` ` It actually could help improve -LRB- U.S.-Cuba -RRB- relations if we cooperate in the right way and we have the right attitude , '' he said .
