WASHINGTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Jun 23 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2010-06-23T15:57">3:57 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Democrats in the House of Representatives have begun drafting legislation to tighten oil industry practices , especially in deep - water drilling projects like the one that has left millions of gallons of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico .
` ` We 're working on it , '' House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-22">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Asked when the legislation might start moving through the House , Waxman responded , ` ` I do n't have a timetable . ''
The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion on a BP - leased oil rig that led to the worst environmental accident in U.S. history triggered a wave of congressional investigations .
Following several high - profile hearings , including testimony from top BP officials , bills to address the problem are beginning to move and others are being drafted .
It 's too early to know how their final versions will look or when Congress might complete the work .
Waxman 's committee alone has held seven hearings on the oil spill since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-05-12">May 12</TIMEX3> .
One House Democratic aide said that members of the Energy and Commerce Committee ` ` have heard enough information to at least get started in terms of the regulatory and legislative responses '' to the disaster .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-05">Last month</TIMEX3> , President Barack Obama created an independent commission to probe the oil spill .

But with that panel only <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> getting organized , Democrats in Congress are not waiting for it to wrap up its work sometime <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2011">next year</TIMEX3> , when Republicans likely will hold more seats in the Senate and House .
` ` We want to make sure that where there 's a government permit to allow drilling , that all necessary safety measures are reviewed and approved and that the standards are met , '' Waxman said .
A House Democratic leadership aide added , ` ` It 's my understanding '' that Waxman is writing legislation addressing the ` ` design , maintenance and testing of drilling equipment . ''
The committee also might hold new hearings , according to House aides , but those sessions have not yet been firmed up .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had set a <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-07-04">July 4</TIMEX3> deadline for lawmakers to put together ideas on how to deal legislatively with the BP oil spill , which is estimated to be releasing as much as 60,000 barrels of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> into Gulf waters .
A series of bills could be debated in the House in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming weeks</TIMEX3> .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , the House was poised to pass a bill granting subpoena power to the Obama - appointed commission .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also is having his committee chairmen write legislation that could be folded into a larger energy and environment bill he hopes to put to a vote in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> .
That bill likely would encourage the use of more alternative fuels by electric utilities in addition to stepping up regulation of drilling .
It also might impose mandatory carbon dioxide emission reductions to fight global warming , but Democrats are split on this .
Other oil spill - related bills moving in the House include : -- The House Judiciary Committee on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> approved a bill to expand the type of damages that can be claimed in oil spills .
Other bills pending in Congress would raise or lift caps on industry liability .
The Judiciary committee also voted to authorize issuing subpoenas to BP for documents on its Gulf oil spill claims process ; -- House Democrats will try to pass emergency spending legislation soon that includes around $ 200 million for oil spill - related activities .
The bill also would allow the Interior Department to take more time to review lease requests for oil drilling ; -- House committees are working on bills to improve worker safety in oil spill cleanup efforts and to develop better preparedness standards for offshore energy projects .
