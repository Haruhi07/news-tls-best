The disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates a pressing need for the United States to pass legislative incentives to drive investment dollars into cellulosic and algae - based biofuel facilities , biofuel industry leaders said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
` ` This is just a wakeup call for our dependence on petroleum , '' said Harrison Dillon , President of Solazyme Inc , which is building an integrated biorefinery in rural Pennsylvania aiming for commercial - scale production of algae - based fuel .
Harrison said the BP spill , the largest in U.S. history , highlights the ` ` ugly side of our dependence on fossil fuels . ''
` ` It just points even more strongly for the need for all these technologies to be developed and encouraged .
The oil that we make through our process is biodegradable oil .
It is made on land .
You do n't have those kinds of risks , '' Dillon said .
A range of commercial - scale projects to develop cellulosic and algae biofuels are ready to be built , but the economic downturn , uncertainty in global financial markets and the lack of long - term U.S. government support is making it hard to raise capital , company officials said in a conference call .
A massive jobs bill pending in Congress includes a $ 1 - per - gallon tax credit for biodiesel retroactive to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2011-01-01">January 1</TIMEX3> and valid through <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">the end of 2010</TIMEX3> .
The bill also includes a 50 - cent credit for fuel produced from biomass .
More than 30 biofuel companies and trade associations have asked leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee to extend the cellulosic biofuel production tax credit to at least <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2016">2016</TIMEX3> , and to make algae biofuel producers eligible , creating a renewable investment tax credit option .
Wes Bolsen , chief marketing officer for Illinois - based Coskata Inc , said the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> move by French oil company Total to take an equity stake in Coskata is part of a growing commitment by oil companies to play a bigger role in advancing biofuels .
Still , government policy support is critical to move forward to commercial production , he said .
` ` What we have is a technology that is ready <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">today</TIMEX3> .
We believe we can economically compete head to head with gasoline .
We need the policy that is going to show we have the enduring commitment , '' he said .
Coskata , founded <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2006">four years ago</TIMEX3> , has a demonstration facility in Pennsylvania that can produce cellulosic ethanol from grass , trash , wood chips , and various crop residues .
HR BioPetroleum Chief Operating Officer Martin Sabarsky said his company needs more government support if it is to proceed with a commercial algae - based biofuels facility in Hawaii .
It has received support from Royal Dutch Shell oil company but is having problems securing needed private capital .
Sabarsky <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> discussions with Shell in light of the BP oil spill tragedy have further underscored the need for alternative fuels .
` ` They -LRB-
Shell -RRB- have recognized ... that the age of easy oil is over , '' he said .
