LONDON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-12-01">Dec 1 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-12-01T08:28">8:28 am</TIMEX3> EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-11">Last month</TIMEX3> , BP increased by $ 8 billion the financial provisions it was taking for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ; the company 's shares rose .
Better - than - expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new Chief Executive Bob Dudley were taken by the market as a sign the company had turned the corner and would soon return to pumping out steadily rising dividends .
Key to this sanguine outlook is confidence that the new estimate of the total cost of the spill -- $ 40 billion -- will be sufficient .
` ` We think that $ 40 billion adequately provisions for the liabilities that are outstanding so far , '' said Mark Lacey , Fund Manager at Investec Global Energy Fund .
Paul Mumford , fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management , went further , saying the provision is likely to be overly conservative : ` ` You might well find that you get provision write - backs , '' he said , hinting the bill could be lower .
That optimistic view may turn out to be true .
BP executives have said this is their ` ` best estimate '' of costs , adding they could turn out lower .
But history shows there is ample scope for nasty surprises from BP .
The London - based oil giant -- <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009">last year</TIMEX3> it was the biggest non - state controlled oil and gas producer in the world -- has so far consistently underestimated the scope and potential cost of the Gulf spill .
It also has a track record of low - balling disasters , including the fatal Texas City refinery blast in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
Not only has the company underestimated the cost of repairing equipment and ecosystems in the past , it has also made overly optimistic assumptions about legal challenges .
That may be happening again .
CEO Dudley , an American who took over from Briton Tony Hayward in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> , has said a $ 20 billion fund BP created to compensate victims of the spill should cover all damages claims .
The lawyers who are suing BP do n't think so .
` ` The total value of the claims already registered could exceed the amount of money that has been dedicated to pay the fund , '' said Texas - based trial lawyer Brent Coon , who represents victims of the explosion and subsequent spill and who was prominent in litigation against BP after Texas City .
` ` Then you have the claims that have not been filed yet , and claims from those indirectly impacted , and shareholder derivative claims ...
You have very large potential claims that could , in total , be exponentially greater than the amount set aside . ''
Zygmunt Plater , Professor of Law at Boston College Law School , agrees .
` ` In the short term , it 's in everyone 's interests within the company to low - ball -- but the portents are there for a realistic inflation of $ 20 - $ 50 billon , '' he said .
An analysis by Reuters of the potential fines , damages , costs related directly to the leak , compensation and the damage to BP 's business suggests the final spill bill could , over the long term , end up much higher than BP 's latest provision -- perhaps even more than twice as much .
Much hinges on whether U.S. courts find the company was ` ` grossly negligent '' in the run - up to the disaster , but there are other risks .
BP declined to comment for this article , beyond stating that it stands by its statements on the likely costs and that its estimates are based on the assumption that it was not grossly negligent .
` ` UNPRECEDENTED STRING OF BAD NEWS '' BP 's inability to gauge the true scope of the spill in the early days in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2011-04">April</TIMEX3> is well documented .
After the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , following an explosion which killed 11 workers , the company initially hoped to staunch the flow of oil from the well by activating shut - off valves with subsea robots .
In case this did n't work , it started drilling a relief well to permanently plug the well from below .

<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1W">A week</TIMEX3> after the blast , the company said the well would take <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> to complete and cost $ 100 million -- but that would be the most expensive part of the whole response operation .
Combining this with the daily expenditure that BP reported at the time suggested a total bill of $ 200 million .
BP hinted then that even this calculation was pessimistic .
As estimates of the spill flow increased -- it eventually became the worst in U.S. history -- so did the cost .
From an initial 1,000 barrels per day to 5,000 bpd , it finally reached 62,000 bpd .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , BP told analysts the cost of containing and cleaning up the spill would be $ 3 - 6 billion .
By mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-09">September</TIMEX3> , the response effort alone , excluding damages claims , had cost BP $ 8 billion .
Investment analysts were forgiving of these errors .
The disaster seemed to grow worse and worse making accurate estimates difficult .
` ` It was an unprecedented string of bad news , '' Simon Hawkins , oil analyst at Ambrian said <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last month</TIMEX3> .
But even after the well was capped , BP appeared no more adept at forecasting costs .
<TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P12D">Twelve days</TIMEX3> after it had sealed the top of the well , on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> , the company said the likely cost of the spill would be $ 32 billion .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-11-02">November 2</TIMEX3> , it hiked its estimate by another 25 percent , or $ 8 billion .
BP 's Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote blamed that increase mainly on a delay in completing the relief well , which meant the company needed to keep its offshore response effort going longer .
In a conference call with analysts , he also cited costs related to decontamination of the thousands of ships used in the spill response and undefined administration and legal costs .
BP did not give a detailed breakdown , but it is hard to see how the delay in the relief well accounted for most of the increased provision .
Assuming an extra <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DURATION" value="P40D">40 days</TIMEX3> at the average cash - burn for the operation of $ 60 million per day gives an extra spend of only $ 2.6 billion .
In addition to this , the well delay and many extra costs were already clear in <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> and could have been factored in earlier .
Nonetheless , analysts have largely accepted the company 's estimates .
Perhaps this is on the assumption that after months of bad publicity , the suspension of dividend payments for at least three quarters , a collapse in its share price to less than half its pre - spill level and a change of CEO , BP would take the opportunity to throw every conceivable cost into the mix and pave the way for recovery under a new boss .
It 's a common enough practice when corporations change CEO .
` ` I tend to believe BP .
Given how bad it was , they basically decided to kitchen - sink it , '' says Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon .
WHAT HISTORY CAN TEACH US Such an assumption , though , may not be entirely safe in BP 's case .
The company 's record of assessing costs after past disasters is less than stellar .
BP 's Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico captured front pages around the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2005-SU">the summer of 2005</TIMEX3> when a hurricane left it listing precariously .
The company predicted it would take <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> and $ 250 million to repair the damaged platform .
In the end , it took <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="LESS_THAN">almost three years</TIMEX3> to fix ; analysts estimate BP spent more than $ 500 million .
That undershoot was nothing compared with what followed the explosion at its Texas City refinery in <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
The blast killed 15 workers and ruined the company 's carefully nurtured reputation as the green and caring face of Big Oil .
Because it was a single - point disaster , the cost of Texas City should have been easier to quantify than an ongoing catastrophe like the Gulf spill .
A gasoline production unit destroyed in the blast would need to be replaced , BP said .
The going cost for such machinery was widely agreed to be in the region of $ 100 - $ 200 million .
A few pessimists added in ancillary damages , lost profits and legal costs to arrive at a total cost of $ 1 billion .
But <TIMEX3 tid="t63" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> after the accident , then - CEO John Browne said the final bill would be ` ` significantly '' less than that and analysts put the total cost at around $ 300 - 400 million , a figure the company appeared comfortable with .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least .
Claims remain outstanding , so the final tally could be even higher .
Is BP making the same mistake on penalties and compensation again ?
A ` ` gross negligence '' finding would require the Department of Justice to show a high degree of recklessness on the part of senior BP officials , rather than a mistake by a low - level worker .
BP has blamed low - level employees and its contractors for the Deepwater Horizon rig blast .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="2010-11-08">November 8</TIMEX3> , a report by the White House oil spill commission prompted many analysts to assume it was going to be tough to pin gross negligence on BP for the Gulf spill , and BP shares rose as a result .
The commission said it had found no direct evidence of ` ` a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety '' in BP .
But the commission 's co - chairmen , Bill Reilly and Bob Graham , subsequently stressed that its <TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="2010-11-08">November 8</TIMEX3> finding did not mean anyone was off the hook .
They said a ` ` culture that did not promote safety '' had fostered misjudgments leading up to the disaster in all the companies involved .
A panel of scientists conducting another probe for the government subsequently said that BP 's systems for managing drilling risks were inadequate .
Some lawmakers argue that in BP 's case , the culture created an incentive for employees to short - cut safety precautions without issuing explicitly dangerous orders .
David Logan , professor of law at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island , believes there is no legal reason why a claimant could not establish gross negligence on the part of a corporation based solely on its culture .
` ` Can you stitch together an argument of gross negligence from the corporate culture ?
It is possible to do that , '' Logan says .
If BP is found to be grossly negligent , the U.S. Clean Water Act allows for a fine of up to $ 4,300 per barrel , nearly four times the $ 1,100 maximum BP otherwise faces .
The government estimates 4.9 million barrels of oil flowed from BP 's well , suggesting a maximum fine of $ 5.4 billion if ` ` gross negligence '' is not proven , and $ 21.1 billion if it is .
The company has argued that it should receive credit for the 700,000 barrels of oil which it scooped from the surface or burned , and it disputes the government estimate of the size of the spill .
` ` I think there 's room for considerable discussion there , '' Dudley said <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2010-11">last month</TIMEX3> .
A close study of company statements suggests BP has factored in a fine below $ 4 billion .
As well as adding billions to that , a gross negligence finding would prevent BP from forcing its partners to pay their share of any fine or cleanup costs .
Anadarko Petroleum , 25 percent owner of the blown - out well , and 10 percent owner , Japan 's Mitsui , have so far refused to pay , saying their contractual obligation to do so is void due to gross negligence on the part of the project operator , BP .
Any costs BP might recover are not included in its <TIMEX3 tid="t73" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> estimates because accounting rules prevent this , although the company has said it does expect to recoup money from its partners and has reserved the right to sue the companies it hired to help drill the well .
Most lawyers expect BP and the Department of Justice to reach a settlement that avoids a court ruling on the degree of negligence .
The spill -- and President Barack Obama 's inability to halt it -- hurt the president 's ratings .
` ` The government can not let them get away with it .
After President Obama came in with the heavy foot , they just ca n't , '' the chief executive of a rival oil company , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the spill , told Reuters .
Plater , the Boston professor , says if the government sought to be aggressive it could attempt to broaden the interpretation of environmental and economic damages that BP must make good .
Oil and fishing dominate employment along the Gulf coast , especially in Louisiana , the state worst hit by the spill .
While most of the fishing bans have been lifted , experts say it will take years for the coast to recover .
` ` There are different ways of measuring natural resource damages and the ecosystem services argument , '' Plater says .
When you knock out an ecosystem , looking at the damage in terms of indirect harm to the economy could carry the cost ` ` into the hundreds of billions '' .
BP 's assessments of the environmental damage caused by the spill are at the optimistic end of the spectrum .
A government report released in <TIMEX3 tid="t74" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> suggested up to 75 percent of the oil had disappeared -- BP has often referred to this report , and former CEO Hayward <TIMEX3 tid="t75" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> told a gathering of students in Cambridge , England , that all of the spilled oil had gone .
However , researchers at the University of Georgia said in <TIMEX3 tid="t77" type="DATE" value="2010-08" mod="END">late August</TIMEX3> that about three - quarters of the oil was still lurking below the surface ; other studies have also pointed to the prospect of severe long - term damage .
BP will be on the hook to make any such damage good .
Whatever BP ends up paying in fines and cleanup costs , there could be another big charge : punitive damages .
Such a charge would be helped by a finding of gross negligence , though claimants could pursue punitive damages even if gross negligence was n't proven .
Exxon Mobil paid punitive damages of $ 1 per $ 1 of economic damage following the <TIMEX3 tid="t78" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska when the captain of the tanker , who had been drinking , hit a reef .
Jamison Colburn , Professor of Law at Penn State University , says it is not entirely clear whether the <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> law covering oil spills at sea will allow punitive damages for BP , though if such damages are allowed , a one - to - one ratio would be in line with precedents like the Valdez .
` ` Punitive damages are a wild card , '' he said .
` ` It 's still an open question . ''
In the Texas City case , BP settled all claims out of court , so a judge did not rule on punitive damages .
However , lawyers say the amount paid out in settlements is consistent with an expectation there was a good chance significant punitive damages would have been awarded .
If BP were to face punitive damages , given the prevailing estimates of economic damages at around $ 20 billion for the Gulf spill , a fine at the same ratio could add another $ 20 billion to its bill .
But trial lawyer Coon says he believes punitive damages could be levied at a higher multiple , because the accusations against BP are greater than those Exxon faced .
` ` In that accident , a drunk captain inadvertently ran his ship onto a reef .
The drunk captain was n't doing something at the request of the company , '' Coon said , referring to the arguments which would underpin a gross negligence claim .
What 's clearly not included in BP 's spill estimate is a figure related to the damage the disaster has done to its U.S. business over the long term .
BP said it lost 30,000 barrels per day of production in the Gulf -- one of its most profitable bases -- in <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DATE" value="2010-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> , and expected further impacts in <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="2010-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> and into <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> .

But the added regulatory scrutiny the oil firm is likely to undergo in the United States will surely add to its operating costs .
Analysts at Bernstein say BP 's upstream production costs could rise by 10 percent , or $ 280 million <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> .
Using the company 's own internal discount rate of 9 - 13 percent implies the present value of a 10 percent rise in these costs would be $ 2.5 billion .
If other areas of BP 's U.S. business faced similar increases , the hit could be twice this .
In addition , some lawmakers have called for BP , <TIMEX3 tid="t90" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> the Gulf 's largest operator , to be banned from future license rounds .
` ` BP may find that when its application for a license goes in , it is put in the ` pending ' file while Shell or someone else gets the license , '' said Iain Armstrong , analyst at Brewin Dolphin .
Tally up fines commensurate with gross negligence , punitive damages at a ratio of just once economic damages , lower production , a 10 percent rise in U.S. operating costs , and difficulties in securing new reserves in the United States , and you quickly reach a figure around $ 50 billion .
That may not be as dramatic as it sounds : some costs could still be shared with partners and contractors , many would be tax deductible , and they would in any case probably be payable <TIMEX3 tid="t98" type="DURATION" value="PXY" mod="MORE_THAN">over many years</TIMEX3> .
The company can likely afford even the most pessimistic estimates .
But things might not be as easy <TIMEX3 tid="t100" type="DATE" value="2010-12-01">today</TIMEX3> as they were in <TIMEX3 tid="t99" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> .
BP 's under - clubbing of the costs of Texas City was made up for by a more than doubling of the oil price between <TIMEX3 tid="t101" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t102" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
The outlook for crude <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is less bullish , which may mean the oil giant has fewer places to hide .
` ` A very slight miscalculation <TIMEX3 tid="t107" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> about what we think is going to happen is magnified by the huge numbers of stake holders -LRB- who could make claims -RRB- , '' said Logan of Roger Williams University .
` ` A billion here , a billion there and pretty soon you 're talking about real money . ''
Despite BP 's official statements , some industry analysts say the company may be expecting to have to pay more .
` ` The way that they are selling assets and strengthening their balance , is what you would expect them to do if they were preparing for a worse scenario such as a finding of gross negligence , '' said one analyst who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen questioning BP 's public comments .
<TIMEX3 tid="t113" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Currently</TIMEX3> , analysts predict BP will reinstate its dividend in <TIMEX3 tid="t112" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="START">early 2011</TIMEX3> , at half the pre - spill level .
If it has n't done its sums right , a return to steady dividend growth from the company could take quite a while longer .
