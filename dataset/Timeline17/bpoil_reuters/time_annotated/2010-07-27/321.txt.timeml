BP oil spill to cost U.S. taxpayer almost $ 10 billion LONDON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Jul 27 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-07-27T07:37">7:37 am</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil giant BP said it plans to offset the entire cost of its Gulf of Mexico oil spill against its tax bill , reducing future contributions to U.S. tax coffers by almost $ 10 billion .
BP took a pretax provision of $ 32.2 billion in its accounts for the period , for the cost of capping the well , cleaning up the spill , compensating victims and paying government fines .
However , the net impact on BP 's bottom line will only be $ 22 billion , with the company recording a $ 10 billion tax credit , most of which will be borne by the U.S. taxpayer , a spokesman said .
BP 's UK tax bill will also be reduced , BP added .
Analysts said BP could prompt more public and political anger in the United States by deducting all the costs , and especially the expected fines BP will face .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> , Boeing Co decided to forego seeking a tax deduction for any of a $ 615 million settlement with the government in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> over ethics charges , under pressure from lawmakers .

` ` Too smart for your own good '' must be a US saying and not heard in the UK .
What a surprise who pays in the end for the mega rich corporation 's gross negligence .
They spilled millions and millions of gallons in our environment , killed unknown amounts of wildlife , ruined thousands of people 's jobs and they get a tax credit out of it to the tune of 10 Billion dollars ?
This is the way our once great country <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> works ?
All of this but keeping the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> tax breaks in place to help out the lower to middle class is just financially irresponsible ?
This country is still great but its leaders -LRB- both sides -RRB- just plain suck
and they are determined to continue to fool the American people until there is no middle class left -- just serfs and the mega rich .
