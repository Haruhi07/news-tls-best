BP gets ` ` wake - up call '' and $ 32 billion in spill charges LONDON\/HOUSTON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Jul 27 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-07-27T19:13">7:13 pm</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's newly named chief executive on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> called the Gulf oil spill a ` ` wake - up call '' for the entire industry as the company tallied up its losses and disclosed two U.S. investigations .
Bob Dudley , who will replace gaffe - prone Tony Hayward as CEO on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-10-01">October 1</TIMEX3> , said safety would be among his highest priorities as he tries to refurbish the oil company 's battered reputation .
Image repair may become even tougher after BP said it would offset the cost of the spill against its taxes , costing U.S. taxpayers almost $ 10 billion .
BP reported a second - quarter loss of $ 17 billion , including $ 32 billion in charges related to the oil spill , the largest in U.S. history .
It also announced plans to sell $ 30 billion in assets <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P18M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 18 months</TIMEX3> to help cover its liabilities .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have launched ` ` informal enquiries '' into securities matters related to the spill , BP said .
A Senate probe into whether BP influenced the release of the Lockerbie bomber added yet another source of friction .
Senator Robert Menendez postponed a hearing on the matter , scheduled for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> , and accused BP and British officials of stonewalling .
More than 5 million barrels of oil have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico since the undersea leak began in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , according to U.S. government estimates .
The spill , caused by an explosion that killed 11 people , has devastated communities and fragile ecosystems along the Gulf Coast , killing or injuring countless sea creatures and coastal birds .
Private lawsuits have piled up .
Attorneys hoping to lead the legal fight against BP are heading to the unlikely venue of Boise , Idaho , <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W30">this week</TIMEX3> as a special judicial panel considers how to handle all the cases .
BP 's U.S.-listed shares closed 1.7 percent lower on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
BP shares in London closed 2.6 percent lower .
The company has lost about 40 percent of its market value since the explosion .
Ted Parrish , co - portfolio manager of the Henssler Equity Fund in Kennesaw , Georgia , said the sheer size of BP 's quarterly loss had unsettled investors .
Wall Street ` ` expected a big number , but to actually read the tape and see that number , it tends to shock people , '' he said .
But aside from the spill , BP 's business is steaming ahead with underlying quarterly profits up 77 percent from the year before thanks to higher oil and gas prices and better refining margins .
The stock had gained on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> after reports surfaced that Hayward would be ousted as CEO after a series of public relations blunders , including complaining he wanted his ` ` life back '' weeks after the start of the spill .
` ` I believe that it is not possible for the company to move on in the United States with me remaining as the face to BP , '' Hayward told reporters on a conference call .
` ` So I think that for the good of BP , and particularly for the good of BP in the United States , it is right for me to ... step down . ''
BP 's leaking well was capped <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-W28">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> after gushing up to 60,000 barrels per day into the Gulf , ruining fishing and tourism industries and polluting the shoreline with slimy goo .
BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said the company would take a hard look at itself in the aftermath of the spill : ` ` BP ... will be a different company going forward . ''
The White House said President Barack Obama spoke with Svanberg on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-07-26">Monday</TIMEX3> but declined to say what was discussed .
Dudley , who will be the first American to lead BP , was raised in Mississippi , a fact that seems to be working in his favor among some Gulf residents .
` ` I think people would be more comfortable with someone running BP -LRB- who -RRB- is from the Deep South , '' said Richard Angelico , a 66 - year - old lifelong resident of Orleans Parish , Louisiana .
` ` Hayward was inept at public relations and speaking to people in southern Louisiana . ''
Dudley said on ABC 's ` ` Good Morning America '' he expected no more oil to flow into the Gulf , but added : ` ` we ' ve got to really kill that well to be absolutely certain . ''
BP could begin the final procedure to permanently plug the well <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-W31" mod="END">late next week</TIMEX3> .
Some investors and analysts say BP 's culture encourages greater risk - taking than rivals , contributing to higher returns .
Critics have also blamed this culture for the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
Dudley told a conference call with reporters that safety ` ` is going to be one of my highest priorities , in addition to the focus on making sure we meet our obligations around the Gulf Coast . ''
The spill looks likely to leave a legislative legacy .
The Senate may begin debating a slimmed - down energy bill as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-07-22">Thursday</TIMEX3> , and holding BP accountable for cleaning up the Gulf will be a priority .
BP said it planned to sell assets worth up to $ 30 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P18M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next 18 months</TIMEX3> to pay for its liabilities and create a leaner company with the potential for higher growth .
Investment bankers said the assets BP could sell include its stake in Alaska 's huge Prudhoe Bay oil field and its interest in Pan American Energy in Argentina , as well as smaller assets in Vietnam , Pakistan and Colombia .
Industry executives said it was a good time to sell assets as relative stability in the oil price in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P9M">the past nine months</TIMEX3> makes it easier for buyers and sellers to agree to deal terms .
BP agreed to a $ 7 billion sale of oil and gas fields to Apache Corp <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2010-W29">last week</TIMEX3> , which valued the assets at around $ 19.40 per barrel of oil equivalent .
The rest of BP trades at an implied $ 7\/barrel , analysts at Morgan Stanley said .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
I did business with BP <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">many years ago</TIMEX3> where my Company supplied them with pressure vessels and I found their practices unacceptable .
I am surprised it has taken this long for them to get caught out .
It is a very sad day when a gust of hot wind -LRB- Obama -RRB- and his cronies -LRB- the American people -RRB- can influence business so much in such a distorted fashion .
As one commentator pointed out , Goldman Sachs deliberately polluted the world economy , being responsible for almost pulling down the entire system , yet they are only fined $ 550 m -- after hearings and trials .
Yet BP pollutes 4 states in one country and is ` fined ' $ 20b -- before any justice is permitted .
Once again , the world bears witness to the arrogance of the US and unfortunately bears the brunt of its self centered attitude .
Had this been a US company polluting the Greek or Australian\/NZ coastlines it would be a completely different story .
<TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> God help us from the Americans .
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
