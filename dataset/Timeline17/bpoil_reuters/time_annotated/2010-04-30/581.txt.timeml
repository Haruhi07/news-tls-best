NEW YORK , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">April 30</TIMEX3> | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Apr 30 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-04-30T10:43">10:43 am</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">April 30</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Containment and cleanup costs of a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could top $ 3 billion , but financial impacts on BP Plc will be limited by the oil company 's insurance , Fitch Ratings said on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-30">Friday</TIMEX3> .

N -RRB- exploded in flames on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> and collapsed <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">two days later</TIMEX3> , leading to a massive oil spill that threatened to become the worst U.S. ecological disaster ever .
The spreading oil has deepened fears of severe damage to fisheries , wildlife refuges and tourism in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
Shrimp fishermen in Louisiana have filed a class action lawsuit against BP , accusing it of negligence .
` ` The ultimate financial impact on BP will depend on how the environmental and economic impact develops when the spill reaches land , '' Fitch said in a statement .
Costs could be more than $ 3 billion , depending on how long it takes to arrest the flow of oil into the Gulf , Jeffrey Woodruff , senior director in Fitch 's energy team in London , said in the statement .
Insurance will likely cover the majority of BP 's costs , limiting rating pressure , Fitch said .
It <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> rates BP AA - plus , just one notch below its top rating of AAA .
There are precedents for assessing the potential impacts , Fitch said .
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez spill , when about 250,000 barrels of crude oil were spilled into Prince William Sound , Alaska , cleanup costs were an estimated $ 2 billion , Fitch said .
Exxon was eventually found liable for actual damages of about $ 287 million and compensatory damages of about $ 500 million after a series of appeals spanning <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P20Y" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly 20 years</TIMEX3> , Fitch said .
Exxon was originally assessed punitive damages of $ 5 billion but a US Supreme Court ruling in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> imposed limits on punitive damages , helping reduce Exxon 's liability , Fitch said .
Assuming the BP oil spill is worse than the Exxon Valdez accident , as environmentalists are <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> claiming , and it takes an additional <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="P60D">60</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> to drill a relief well and stop the leak , the total spill could be about 1 million barrels , Fitch said .
Fitch said it will take rating action if necessary because of significant increases in BP 's estimated environmental or litigation costs .
