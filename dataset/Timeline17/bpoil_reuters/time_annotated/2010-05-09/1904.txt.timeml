S. Navy\/Handout ROBERT , Louisiana | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-09">May 9 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-09T18:38">6:38 pm</TIMEX3> EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc engineers desperately explored options on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-09">Sunday</TIMEX3> to control oil gushing from a ruptured well deep under the Gulf of Mexico after a setback with a huge undersea containment dome fueled fears of a prolonged and growing environmental disaster .
The spill is spreading west , further from Florida but toward the important shipping channels and rich seafood areas of the Louisiana shoreline , where fishing , shrimping and oyster harvesting bans have been widened .
A state of emergency was declared in Lafourche Parish , Louisiana , with sheen , the leading edge of the oil slick , forecast to come ashore near Port Fourchon within days .
BP is exploring several new options to control the spill after a buildup of crystallized gas in the dome forced engineers to delay efforts to place a massive four - story containment chamber over the rupture on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We 're gathering some data to help us with two things .
One is another way to do containment , the second is other ways to actually stop the flow , '' BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles told Reuters in Venice , Louisiana .
BP was also exploring ways to overcome the containment dome 's problem with gas hydrates -- slushy methane gas that would block the oil from being siphoned up to a waiting ship .
` ` People are working around the clock at BP headquarters , '' U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told National Public Radio .
But conducting operations at depths of one mile below the surface was complicating the challenge .
` ` We 're actually dealing with a source that does n't have human access , '' Allen said .
At least 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\/795 , 000 liters -RRB- of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> have been gushing unchecked into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , rupturing the well and killing 11 crew members .
On Dauphin Island , Alabama , a barrier island and beach resort , sunbathers found tar balls along a short stretch of beach .
Experts were testing the tar to determine if it came from the Gulf spill .
The spill , which could become the worst in U.S. history , threatens economic and ecological disaster on Gulf Coast tourist beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds .
It has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling .
The disaster could slow the exploration and development of offshore oil projects worldwide , the head of the International Energy Agency warned .
` ` The future potential is offshore in deeper water and in the Arctic , so if offshore investment is going to be slowed down , that is a concern , '' IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka told Reuters .
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told London 's <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-09">Sunday</TIMEX3> Telegraph it could be weeks or months before the spill is brought under control .
He said the company could spend $ 10 million <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> on clean - up efforts .
BP may next try to plug the damaged blowout preventer on the underwater well by pumping debris into it at high pressure , a technique called a ` ` junk shot , '' or attaching a new preventer on top of it .
` ` They are actually going to take a bunch of debris -- some shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that -- and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up to stop the leak , '' Allen told CBS News .
BP also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak but that could take <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P3M">three months</TIMEX3> .
Hundreds of boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the oil again on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-05-09">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Crews have laid more than 900,000 feet of boom and spread 290,000 gallons -LRB- 1.1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant .
Latest government forecasts show possible effects of the spill moving further west , toward Texas .
` ` With continued winds from the east , potential oil contacts could reach as far west as Point Au Fer Island by <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-05">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , '' the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said .
Sheen is about eight miles off the coast of Port Fourchon , with heavy oil still some 28 miles offshore , said Charlotte Randolph , president of Lafourche Parish .
` ` We 're keeping a very close watch , deploying boom and closing some beaches , '' she said .
Truckloads of sand are being delivered to Port Fourchon to fill large sandbags , which will be dropped by National Guard helicopters in five areas along the coast .
Chett Chiasson , executive director of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission , said access to the port is a major concern .
` ` If necessary , our <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> strategy is to place boom along Belle Pass in Bayou Lafourche to create a ` decontamination station ' for ingress and egress through the port , '' he said .
In Alabama , BP - contracted workers in rubber boots and gloves laid down clusters of oil - absorbing synthetic fibers called pom - poms , erected storm fencing along the Dauphin Island beach and collected samples of the tar and water for testing .
Gary Bratt , owner of Chaise N ' Rays Rentals , which rents recreational equipment on Dauphin Island , said the threat of the spill reaching shore was ruining his business .
` ` Our business is off 70 percent at this point , '' with potential vacationers canceling ` ` right and left , '' he said .
Gulf Coast politicians echoed the public 's fears .
` ` If this gusher continues for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="PXM">several months</TIMEX3> , it 's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it 's going to get down into the Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> and that 's going to take it down into the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida , '' Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson told CNN .
` ` You 're talking about massive economic loss to our tourism , our beaches , our fisheries , very possibly disruption of our military testing and training which is in the Gulf of Mexico . ''
Crews labored to cordon off the entrance to Alabama 's Mobile Bay with a containment boom fence to try to safeguard America 's ninth - largest seaport .
Ships arriving at Southwest Pass , the deepwater entrance to the Mississippi River and New Orleans will be inspected to determine if they need cleaning .
The spill 's only major contact with the shoreline so far has been in the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana , mostly a wildlife reserve .
<TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PXD">The next few days</TIMEX3> threatens wider contact .
Louisiana officials closed more waters to fishing and shrimp and oyster harvesting as the slick edged westward .
Shrimp harvesting is <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> banned from Freshwater Bayou on the central coast to Louisiana 's border with Mississippi .
Some oyster beds west of the Mississippi River also are shut .
Seafood is a $ 2.4 billion industry in Louisiana , which produces more than 30 percent of the seafood originating in the continental United States .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Oil sands can provide clean and enviromentally friendly oil to the world for <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P100Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over a hundred years</TIMEX3> .

This without bringing the hurt and pain to a region that does n't deserve this .
It 's unfortunate that this needed to happen for the world to wake up .
This disaster is a big deal .
It will kill the south eastern gulf coast .
