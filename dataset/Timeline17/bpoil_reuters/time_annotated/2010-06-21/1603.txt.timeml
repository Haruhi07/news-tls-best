Poggy fish lie dead stuck in oil in Bay Jimmy near Port Sulpher , Louisiana <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">June 20 , 2010</TIMEX3> .
NEW ORLEANS\/LAFITTE , Louisiana | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">Jun 21 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-06-21T19:51">7:51 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW ORLEANS\/LAFITTE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil services companies went to court on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">Monday</TIMEX3> seeking to overturn President Barack Obama 's six - month ban on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman said he would decide by <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23">Wednesday</TIMEX3> whether to temporarily lift the ban while the case is heard .
More than a dozen companies involved in offshore drilling operations filed the lawsuit , calling the ban ` ` arbitrary and capricious . ''
` ` The government 's unchecked authority has shut down this entire industry , '' argued lawyer Carl Rosenblum , representing the oil industry .
The lawsuit is the first seeking to reverse Obama 's <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2011-05-28">May 28</TIMEX3> moratorium , which the companies say will force job cuts in the labor force needed to service offshore oil platforms .
The ban has caused the shutdown of 33 deepwater drilling rigs .
Obama imposed the ban after an explosion aboard an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> killed 11 workers and ruptured a well owned by BP Plc , unleashing millions of gallons of crude into the ocean .
The Obama administration argues that the moratorium is necessary to prevent further accidents while a presidential commission investigates the cause of the BP spill .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , a Republican critic of the Obama administration 's handling of the spill , has sided with the companies in the case .
The lawsuit is another example of the administration 's strained relations with big business , which was on display <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">last week</TIMEX3> when BP bowed to pressure from Obama and agreed to set up a $ 20 billion oil spill damages fund .
The spill , <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 63rd day , has soiled the coastline of four U.S. states , threatening tourism and fishing industries ; seeped into ecologically sensitive wetlands and marshes ; battered BP 's image ; and tested Obama , who has come under fire over his handling of the crisis .
If spill spreads , BP could face challenges beyond the Gulf Coast .
Attorneys general from 11 states on the U.S. East Coast warned they would hold the company responsible for injury to wildlife that could affect their coastline .
An independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents -- the U.S. Chemical Safety Board -- is launching a probe into the root causes of the spill .
The case will be handled by the investigators who examined BP 's safety practices after a deadly <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> refinery explosion in Texas .
BP said it has spent $ 2 billion so far on clean - up .
Fueling investor concern about BP 's final bill for the spill , a Democratic U.S. lawmaker on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> released an internal company document that said , in a worst - case scenario , up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> could gush from its ruptured deep - sea well .
The British energy company dismissed it , saying the figure was being taken out of context .
But investors , apparently worried it could mean higher fines and clean - up costs for BP , drove its shares down 4.5 percent in New York trading .
BP plans to raise cash from banks to ensure it has enough money on hand to pay for the clean - up but does not plan a bond offering , sources familiar with the company 's thinking told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">Monday</TIMEX3> .
Banking sources said <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">last week</TIMEX3> that BP was seeking some $ 7 billion from banks .
BP has considered several ways to raise more money , such as selling assets .
But for <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , it is confident its cash resources can cover the bulk of the clean - up costs , one source said .
Seeking to keep the focus on the ecological disaster , New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu hosted mayors from 17 U.S. cities on a visit to the Mississippi Delta , where oil has coated fragile marshlands , tarred wildlife and decimated fisheries .
During the mayors ' visit to marshes in Louisiana 's Barataria Bay , the stench of coagulating oil hung in the air as miles of boom encircled oil - stained marshes and scores of boats skimmed oil from the bay 's waters .
BP continued to siphon more oil from the blown - out deep - sea well .
It said it collected or burned off 23,290 barrels -LRB- 978,180 gallons\/3 .7 million liters -RRB- of crude on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> , still well below the 35,000 - 60 , 000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> that government scientists estimate are gushing from the well .
Both BP and the U.S. government are placing their hopes on two relief wells that are being drilled to permanently cap the leak .
Those wells are expected to be finished in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
BP Managing Director Bob Dudley is in day - to - day charge of the company 's response to the spill after Chief Executive Tony Hayward returned to Britain <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">last week</TIMEX3> , the company said .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Executives only understand costs , not human suffering .
Hit them with severe penalties , and if someone in Congress objects , publicize it loudly .
should consider a fact that is being ignored : Louisianans - because of its royalty payments from oil and gas has the lowest property taxes in the U.S. for fourty plus years .
Since they did not share that income with other states and the citizens of Texas and Louisiana certainly supported their oil industry benefactors as evidenced by the Joe Barton 's ; I '' shed my tears for the fish ! !
Just wait until the oil is caught by the Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> and transported around FL and up the East Coast at 1 m\/sec .
The cost of damages will triple .
