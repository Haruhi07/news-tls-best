Reuters -RRB- - A Manhattan - sized plume of oil spewed deep into the Gulf of Mexico by BP 's broken Macondo well has been consumed by a newly discovered fast - eating species of microbes , scientists reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The micro - organisms were apparently stimulated by the massive oil spill that began in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , and they degraded the hydrocarbons so efficiently that the plume is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> undetectable , said Terry Hazen of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
These so - called proteobacteria -- Hazen calls them ` ` bugs '' -- have adapted to the cold deep water where the big BP plume was observed and are able to biodegrade hydrocarbons much more quickly than expected , without significantly depleting oxygen as most known oil - depleting bacteria do .
Oxygen is essential to the survival of commercially important fish and shellfish ; a seasonal low - oxygen ` ` dead zone '' forms most summers in the Gulf of Mexico , caused by farm chemical run - off that flows down the Mississippi River .
Hydrocarbons in the crude oil from the BP spill actually stimulated the new microbes ' ability to degrade them in cold water , Hazen and his colleagues wrote in research published on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> in the journal Science .
In part , Hazen said , this is because these new ` ` bugs '' have adjusted over millions of years to seek out any petroleum they can find at the depths where they live , which coincides with the depth of the previously observed plume , roughly 3000 feet .
At that depth , water temperature is approximately 41 degrees F -LRB- 5 degrees C -RRB- .
Long before humans drilled for oil , natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico have put out the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> , Hazen said .
Another factor was the consistency of the oil that came from the Macondo wellhead : light sweet Louisiana crude , an easily digestible substance for bacteria , and it was dispersed into tiny droplets , which also makes it more biodegradable .
These latest findings may initially seem to be at odds with a study published <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-08-19">last Thursday</TIMEX3> in Science by researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , which confirmed the existence of the oil plume and said micro - organisms did not seem to be biodegrading it very quickly .
However , Hazen and Rich Camilli of Woods Hole both said on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that the studies complement each other .
The Woods Hole team used an autonomous robot submarine and a mass spectrometer to detect the plume , but were forced to leave the area in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="END">late June</TIMEX3> , when Hurricane Alex threatened .
At that time , they figured the plume was likely to remain for some time .

But that was before the well was capped in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> .
Hazen said that within <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> of the capping , the plume could not be detected , but there was a phenomenon called marine snow that indicated microbes had been feasting on hydrocarbons .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-08-24">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , there was no sign of the plume , Hazen said .
That does n't mean there is no oil left from the 4.9 million barrels of crude that spilled into the Gulf after the <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> blowout at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig .
The U.S. government estimated on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-08-04">August 4</TIMEX3> that 50 percent of the BP oil is gone from the Gulf and the rest is rapidly degrading .

Wold be interesting to <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> what government agency , or corporate entity , involved Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
If it was BP , or NOAA , what was once MMS , then this more than a little suspicious !
Just been WAY too much of ` ` do n't worry , it will be fine '' or ` ` do n't worry , the problem has already gone away , been solved , ... ''
Seems that the Obama administration was arm - in - arm with BP in wanting this to be a See No Evil , kind of deal .
If BP , and NOAA , and EPA , had been honest , then they might have \ * some \ * credibility left .
As is , not sure they have much of that left ...
Unknown ` ` Miracle '' Bugs !
, why can they not eat the fertilizer run - off and solve our ` ` Dead Zone '' problem also .
Hey , maybe even ` ` Global Warming '' , Ha !
