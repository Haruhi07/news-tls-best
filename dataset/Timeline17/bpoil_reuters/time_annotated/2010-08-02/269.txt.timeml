<TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010">This year</TIMEX3> 's low - oxygen ` ` dead zone '' in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the largest ever , about the size of Massachusetts , and overlaps areas hit by oil from BP 's broken Macondo well , Louisiana scientists report .
The area of hypoxia , or low levels of oxygen , covered 7,722 square miles -LRB- 20,000 square kilometers -RRB- of the bottom of the Gulf and extended far into Texas waters , researchers from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium said in a statement late on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-08-01">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` This is the largest such area off the upper Texas coast that we have found since we began this work in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> , '' said Nancy Rabalais , the consortium 's executive director .
` ` The total area probably would have been the largest if we had had enough time to completely map the western part -LRB- of the Gulf -RRB- . ''
The annual <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> ` ` dead zone '' in the Gulf is fueled by farm chemicals carried by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers .
Nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural runoff stimulates algae growth in the Gulf .
When these tiny plants or fecal matter from animals that eat them settles to the bottom waters , decomposition of this organic material by bacteria consumes oxygen in the water , the consortium said .
The result , the researchers said , is oxygen depletion that forces many types of fish , shrimp and crabs to leave the area or suffocate .
Animals that live in the sediments that can survive with little oxygen will die if the oxygen level falls toward zero .
To be considered hypoxic , oxygen content in the bottom waters of the Gulf must reach the level of 2 parts per million or less .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-07" mod="END">late July</TIMEX3> , large patches of the northern Gulf had reached that level , including one swath off Texas 's Galveston Bay .

While the area of the BP oil spill overlaps some parts of the ` ` dead zone , '' Rabalais said , ` ` It would be difficult to link conditions seen <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> with oil from the BP spill in either a positive or negative way . ''
