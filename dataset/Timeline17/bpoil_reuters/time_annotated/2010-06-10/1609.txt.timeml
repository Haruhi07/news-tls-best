HOUSTON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Jun 10 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-10T19:51">7:51 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. government scientists on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> doubled their estimate of the amount of oil gushing out of a ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well as British energy giant BP scrambled to stem the leak .
The news that the flow rate may be as high 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- per day came after U.S. markets closed .
BP shares closed 6.65 percent down in London at 365.50 pence while in New York they rebounded from 14 - year lows to end 12.3 percent higher at $ 32.78 .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> the White House said that President Barack Obama and senior administration officials would meet BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">next Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
BP has come under increased pressure from the Obama administration in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> and on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> British Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain stood ready to help the British company deal with the spill .
Speaking during a visit to Afghanistan , Cameron said he would take up the matter Obama when they speak in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> .
Neighboring Mexico also entered the fray on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
It expects oil from BP Plc 's damaged Gulf of Mexico well to reach its shores by <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-12">December</TIMEX3> , and is considering how to sue the company for any environmental damage , Mexico 's environment minister told Reuters .
Environment Minister Juan Elvira said Mexico is trying to stock up on oil booms and netting , a tough task because the United States has used up most of the gear available to protect its coastline , to try to capture oil that will start drifting south when sea currents change in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-10">October</TIMEX3> .
The spill , already the worst in U.S. history , may well be much bigger than many had thought .
U.S. scientists said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> that between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels -LRB- 840,000 and 1.7 million gallons\/3 .2 million and 6.4 million liters -RRB- of oil flowed from the well before <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-03">June 3</TIMEX3> , when BP 's remotely operated robots sawed through an underwater pipe to clear the way for a capping procedure .
The cutting of the pipe likely increased the flow , but BP says it has collected 73,324 barrels -LRB- 3.1 million gallons\/11 , 7 million liters -RRB- of oil since installing the capping system .
The well 's average flow rate was 25,000 - 30 , 000 bpd , according to the findings of the so - called Flow Rate Technical Group announced by U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt .
BP had no input into the team 's findings .

The wide variation in the estimates points to the difficulty in estimating flow of a well that is 1 mile beneath the surface and reachable only by remotely operated robots .
BP said it was capturing more of the torrent of oil that has spewed relentlessly from the sea bottom since the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> rig explosion that killed 11 workers and set the disaster in motion .
But the almost 16,000 barrels it said on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> it had collected in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P1D">the previous 24 hours</TIMEX3> is triple its initial estimates of the leak 's flow rate , a point that will not be lost on critics as U.S. public and political anger mount .
In another sign the spill is spreading , heavier concentrations of oil began washing up on Florida seashores late on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Until then , debris from the spill had been limited in the state to relatively small tar balls .
It is taking a mounting toll on sea birds and other wildlife and has devastated the commercial and recreational fishing industries in southern Louisiana .
The Obama administration has kept up the heat , saying it would make sure BP paid all damages and cleanup costs from the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of coastline .
The crisis is <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> on the global diplomatic agenda for allies Britain and America .
Cameron 's comments in Kabul marked the first time he had spoken publicly about the catastrophe .
Cameron , who took office in <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> and is under pressure domestically to stand up for the British company , is due to talk to Obama by telephone <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-W23-WE">this weekend</TIMEX3> .
Obama has been sharply critical of BP .
The two leaders ' conversation will have to seek a delicate balance between domestic pressures and long - standing U.S.-British ties .
They will also take place against a backdrop of extreme market volatility for BP .
BP was the second - most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange on <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">Thursday</TIMEX3> after taking a 16 - percent dive to a 14 - year - low <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">the previous day</TIMEX3> amid concerns over BP 's ability to meet mounting costs .
` ` The stock is obviously volatile as investors try to wager on the outcome of the Gulf oil spill , '' said Jud Pyle , chief investment strategist at Options News Network , a division of option market maker PEAK6 Investments in Chicago .
Analysts said the company 's improved performance was partly due to speculation that PetroChina , Asia 's top oil and gas firm , was considering making a bid for BP .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Sounds like they 're a team to me .
And guess who the opponents are ?
This is not a political problem , the fix and cleanup will go on for years .
Obama is only a President with limited powers , there is the judical branch of government that deals with the final damage assesment .
Remember , America is a democracy , there is no King or Queen like in the UK .
My best guess is that BP will have to sell the company to pay for all the final damages .
The buyer most likely will be Chevron , or Royal Dutch Shell .
