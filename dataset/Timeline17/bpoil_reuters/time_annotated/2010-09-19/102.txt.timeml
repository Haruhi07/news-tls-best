HOUSTON | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-09-19">Sep 19 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="TIME" value="2010-09-19T15:58">3:58 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
With a final shot of cement , BP Plc permanently ` ` killed '' its deep - sea well in the Gulf of Mexico that ruptured in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> and unleashed the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the top U.S. spill official said on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-09-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Some <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P153D">153 days</TIMEX3> after the Macondo well ruptured , the U.S. government confirmed that BP had succeeded in drilling a relief well nearly 18,000 feet below the ocean surface and permanently sealing the well with cement .
` ` The Macondo 252 well is effectively dead , '' retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who has overseen the U.S. government 's response , said in a statement .
` ` We can <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> state , definitively , that the Macondo well poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico . ''
President Barack Obama , whose public approval ratings were hurt by public discontent over the U.S. government 's initial response to the spill , welcomed the long - awaited development as an ` ` important milestone . ''
Obama said his administration was <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> focused on making sure the Gulf Coast ` ` recovers fully from this disaster . ''
` ` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them , '' Obama said in a statement .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-09-16">Thursday</TIMEX3> , a relief well bored into the bottom of the Macondo well to pump in cement and seal the reservoir for good .
BP pumped cement for <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PT7H">seven hours</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-09-17">Friday</TIMEX3> , and finished a pressure test early on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-09-19">Sunday</TIMEX3> that showed the well was permanently clogged , Allen said .
The development provided an anticlimactic end to the disaster <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="P5M" mod="LESS_THAN">nearly five months</TIMEX3> after the well ruptured on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , causing an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil into the sea .
Tony Hayward , BP 's gaffe - prone chief executive who absorbed the brunt of public anger over the spill , called the final plugging ` ` a significant milestone , '' and reiterated the company 's commitment to cleaning up the mess .
The spill marred the coasts of four U.S. Gulf states , prompted a ban on new deepwater drilling and left BP 's image in tatters in the United States , home to 40 percent of the London - based oil giant 's business .
The disaster also wiped about $ 70 billion from BP 's market value and spurred BP to replace Hayward with an American , Bob Dudley , effective <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-10-01">October 1</TIMEX3> .
Oil spewed unchecked into the sea from the mile - deep -LRB- 1.6 km deep -RRB-
well for 87 straight days until <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , when BP engineers sealed it with a cap .
By then , the well had gushed more than 16 times as much as the 257,000 barrels of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
For the U.S. offshore drilling industry , which is reeling from a deepwater drilling ban imposed by the White House soon after the spill , uncertainty still abounds .
Operators in the Gulf -- long considered a haven from the political uncertainties of Venezuela and Russia -- will <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> have to contend with stricter federal regulations that will make it harder and more expensive to drill .
` ` There 's clearly a sense that the page has been turned <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , '' said Daniel Yergin , oil industry historian and chairman of IHS CERA .
` ` It 's <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the day after for the oil and gas industry in the Gulf . ''
In New Orleans , which has seen its tourism and seafood industries hurt by the spill , word of the well 's permanent demise brought little rejoicing .
` ` I feel like any world citizen would in this crisis -- that it was a threat to the entire world ecology , '' said Carey Beckham , a partner at Beckham Bookshop in the French Quarter .
` ` I ' m relieved , but the jury 's still out . ''

It 's nice to see they are letting someone make a comment again .
The censorship is almost beyond belief .
Bob Dudley had better get it right .
