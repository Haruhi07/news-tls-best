HOUSTON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">Jun 29 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-29T19:45">7:45 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Bad weather halted some clean - up efforts from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> as high winds and waves from a strengthening storm threatened to hamper plans to capture more of the crude gushing from the largest spill in U.S. history .
The National Hurricane Center said tropical storm Alex would build into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season as it moved over southern Gulf waters .
Ripple effects from Alex produced six - foot -LRB- 1.8 - meter -RRB- waves and wind gusts of up to 20 miles per hour and were expected to last <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a couple of days</TIMEX3> , said Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service in New Orleans .
Offshore oil clean - up activity off the Louisiana coast was halted because of severe weather , the U.S. Coast Guard said .
Controlled burns of oil on the ocean , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all stopped , said Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker .
However , BP Plc 's oil - capture and relief well drilling continued at the site of the leak .
Grigsby said the weather would also affect clean - up operations on beaches and marshes .
Alex , forecast to strengthen into a hurricane later on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , was churning northwest across the southwestern Gulf and expected to come ashore near the Texas - Mexico border <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-23" mod="END">late Wednesday</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-24" mod="START">early Thursday</TIMEX3> .
BP spokesman Robert Wine said BP 's oil - capture and relief well drilling operations were continuing .
` ` That 's all big equipment , and it is n't as affected by the sea state , '' he said of three rigs and a drillship a mile above the leak .
BP officials have said waves as high as 12 feet -LRB- 4 metros -RRB- would delay plans to hook up a third system to capture much more oil and officials in Florida said high surf would probably hamper clean - up efforts .
BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by $ 100 billion since its Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank in 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,525 metros -RRB- of water on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-22">April 22</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after an explosion and fire killed 11 workers .
But U.S.-listed shares of BP closed 2.29 percent higher at $ 27.67 on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> on bargain - hunting .
The shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began .
` ` It 's tough to say if the stock has bottomed because the political situation remains so fluid , but on a basis the stock is attractive , '' said John Brady , senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago .
The stock 's weakness since the disaster has also sparked talk of a possible takeover bid .
` ` The spill is bad , but you need to remember that BP is a global company with a global business , and there 's strength elsewhere , '' Brady said .
The oil spill crisis is in its 71st day with no firm end in sight .
The economic and ecological costs to tourism , wildlife , fishing and other industries , already massive , continue to mount for four states along the U.S. Gulf coast .
The lucrative tourism industry in the Gulf could be hard hit for years by a false perception the spill has ruined all the beaches , tourism officials said .
U.S. government officials estimate 35,000 to 60,000 barrels are gushing from the blown - out well <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
BP 's containment system can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily .
The planned addition would have raised that to 53,000 bpd .
Senior U.S. officials were beating a path to the Gulf region , responding to criticism that President Barack Obama and his administration responded too slowly to the crisis .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-06-29">Tuesday</TIMEX3> 's visitors included Vice President Joe Biden .
A U.S. appeals court set <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-07-08">July 8</TIMEX3> for oral arguments on the Obama administration 's request to stay a ruling that lifted its six - month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling .
A federal judge blocked it at the request of drilling companies , saying the suspension was too broad and arbitrary .
Polls have given Obama low marks for his handling of the disaster , although not as low as those given to BP .
` ` BP 's handling of the spill from a crisis management perspective will go down in history as one of the great examples of how to make a situation worse by bad communications , '' said Michael Gordon , of New York - based crisis PR firm Group Gordon Strategic Communications .
Mistakes include downplaying the environmental damage , initially blaming others for the disaster and underestimating the amount of oil leaking , analysts say .
As crude oil and dispersants float on the surface of the Gulf , crews are battling to keep it off beaches and away from wildlife breeding grounds .
On Louisiana 's Bay Baptiste , winds whipped waves up about a foot high and white caps were visible in the distance as the outer bands of Alex began to move into the region .
Several marshes were only partially boom - protected , with oil coating the bottom part of reeds as crabs covered in crude scurried on nearby marsh islands .
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-11-30">November 30</TIMEX3> and meteorologists predict <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> will be very active , suggesting more problems for the oil spill clean - up effort .
In Biloxi , Mississippi , BP spokesman Richard Judy acknowledged problems with clean - up operations after the state 's mainland was hit by oil .
` ` What 's keeping us busy in this area is maintaining boom , in some cases putting out new boom , doing pick - up of oiled material on the beaches when it gets there and also going out and working on the coastal islands , '' Judy said .
` ` Weather has been a problem .
We have to be careful not to keep our crews on beaches if there 's lightning nearby . ''
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Containment and closure would have been better but then the loss of profits by the top 2 % would have been unbearable .
So , in keeping with the agenda of having the general population eat the garbage left by those who are presumed better human beings , we 'll just say ` ` how unfortunate that the hurrican season has n't been postponed . ''
This is yellow journalism at its best .
If there was n't an oil spill in the Gulf , nobody north of Brownsville would take a second look at Alex or any overzealous newscaster 's warning of ` ` coastal flooding '' on the north side or water churning in the Gulf .
As a native southeast Texan , I ' ve been through my share of hurricanes and tropical storms , and I can safely say that I am not the least bit worried about Alex , ` ` coastal flooding '' north of South Padre Island or any effect that it ` ` might '' have on the BP oil spill .
You just focus on getting that relief well drilled , BP , and those claims dispersed to the people who need them .
