PENSACOLA BEACH , Florida | Fri <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Jun 4 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-04T19:19">7:19 pm</TIMEX3> EDT PENSACOLA BEACH ,
Florida -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tar balls washed ashore in northwest Florida on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> , the first apparent impact there from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that one senator said meant a ` ` huge economic hit '' to the tourism - dependent state .
Oil debris came ashore among swimmers and beachgoers on Pensacola Beach , part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore , which advertises ` ` the world 's whitest beaches , '' as the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history widened .
Florida , the ` ` Sunshine State '' with a $ 60 billion annual tourism industry , had braced for oil from the 46 - day - old spill to arrive .
Oil had already hit the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama to the west .
Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson told CNN the arrival of the oil signified ` ` a huge economic hit '' to local tourism .
` ` There are already cancellations , the restaurants are down a little bit , '' he said .
Beachgoers on Pensacola Beach , many of them children , picked up rust - colored tar blobs , ranging in size from a button to a table - tennis ball , scattered along the sugar - white sands .
` ` It 's pretty sad because we go here on vacation <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="SET" value="XXXX-SU" quant="EVERY" freq="1S">every summer</TIMEX3> , and <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we wo n't be able to go anymore .
I just ca n't believe it , because it used to be all just white sand , '' one visitor , Grace Vondohlen , said .
Buck Lee , director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , said he could not be sure the oil came from the spill leaking from BP Plc 's undersea Gulf of Mexico well off Louisiana , ` `
but I ' m 90 percent certain that it is . ''
The oil will be analyzed to confirm the link with the oil spill , the worst in U.S. history .
Of all the states affected so far , Florida has the most to lose .
Tourism is its largest industry , generating $ 60 billion in spending from more than 80 million visitors <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , bringing in 21 percent of all state sales taxes and employing nearly 1 million people .
Investment analysts say that since Florida has no income tax and relies heavily on sales tax revenues , any fall - off in tourism could badly squeeze a state economy still bleeding from a housing market meltdown and the global recession .
Nelson told CNN the economic impact of the spill on Gulf Coast states including Florida was ` ` already billions -LRB- of dollars -RRB- ...
and if it goes all <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> and you put that much oil in the Gulf , it 's going to be multiple billions of dollars of economic loss and damage . ''
He added a flotilla of ships , including several Coast Guard cutters , were working 25 to 50 miles off northwest Florida , scooping up portions of oil .
` ` That 's the goal , to try to keep it away from the bays and estuaries and the beach . ''
Near Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island , workers scooped up tar balls with shovels along the high - water line and put them into plastic bags .
` ` They 're working in an area that 's pretty sensitive and has tern nesting areas , '' National Park Services spokeswoman Katie Lawhon said .
` ` I think it 's horrible , '' said Anthony Cross , walking along Pensacola Beach with his three daughters , holding a child 's fishing net full of tar .
` ` You see shells and jellyfish and trash
but I ' ve never seen oil here .
It 's crazy , '' he added .
Florida tourism authorities were rolling out an aggressive advertising campaign , partially funded by BP , aimed at stressing that the state 's beaches remain open for business , despite the pollution threat .
Florida Governor Charlie Crist has asked BP executives for an additional $ 50 million to fight the encroaching oil , on top of $ 25 million already received from the company and spent .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> , Crist asked the British - based company for $ 100 million more to fund spill response efforts by the Florida Institute of Oceanography , a partnership of 21 universities and other marine science organizations .
Florida tourism officials , promising ` ` 100 percent transparency , '' are using live video and Twitter feeds so visitors can check the situation of beaches before booking .
` ` We 're not going to sit here and say , ` The whole state of Florida is going to be shut down as a result of this , ' because that 's just not true , '' said Chris Thompson , who heads the state tourism marketing board .
Many experts believe crude from the Gulf of Mexico spill has already been caught up in the powerful Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> curling around the Florida Peninsula , which could take it into the Florida Keys and possibly up the East Coast .

The responsible parties have A LOT to answer for .

How about the rest of the South West Florida coast ?
Clearwater to Naples ? ? ?
I ca n't believe this President only visited area where the oil spill is hurting so many industries .
Like I added also the rest of the SW Florida Coast where retired Americans and those that are still working for their lively hood live and work <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .

But I ' m sure he will take a trip to Europe many more times in the future .
