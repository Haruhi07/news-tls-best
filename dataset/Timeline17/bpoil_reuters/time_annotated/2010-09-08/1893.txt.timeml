LONDON\/WASHINGTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-09-08">Sep 8 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-09-08T21:10">9:10 pm</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc and its Gulf of Mexico oil
well partners traded blame on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-09-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after an internal BP investigation tried to downplay the company 's role in the world 's biggest offshore spill .
The 193 - page BP report offered a preview of how the British oil giant plans to vigorously defend itself against lawsuits arising from the disaster and any charges of gross negligence , which carry fines potentially in excess of $ 20 billion .
BP accepted some responsibility for the disaster but pointed the finger at what it said were major failures by Transocean Ltd , the operator of the ill - fated Deepwater Horizon oil rig , and oil services company Halliburton , which cemented the deep - sea well that ruptured on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> .
The report drew fire from a prominent U.S. lawmaker who accused BP of trying to minimize its role in the disaster .
Transocean called it a ` ` self - serving '' attempt by BP to escape responsibility for its ` ` fatally flawed '' well design , while Halliburton said the report was filled with inaccuracies .
The report threatened to reignite public anger over the massive spill , which caused an environmental catastrophe along the U.S. Gulf Coast , devastated tourism and fishing in the area and damaged President Barack Obama 's popularity .
Obama 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , declined to comment on BP 's findings and said the government was still investigating the disaster to ` ` find out what went wrong and hold those responsible accountable for the damage that 's been done . ''
BP investigators were unable to identify any single action or inaction that caused the Deepwater Horizon rig to blow up on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 workers , after the Macondo well ruptured .
` ` Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident , '' the report said .
` ` Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . ''
Investors had been eagerly awaiting the report to find out whether BP would be able to share the potential costs of the spill -- estimated by some analysts to exceed $ 50 billion .
Citigroup analysts said in a research note that BP 's report ` ` appears to support the case for no negligence , '' but they acknowledged that the findings of the internal investigation were unlikely to be accepted as objective .
BP shares trading in New York closed up 3.2 percent , while shares of Transocean were 1.3 percent higher and those of Halliburton were up 1.2 percent .
Standard & Poor 's downgraded Transocean 's rating to BBB from BBB - plus , saying the Swiss - based company faced uncertain liabilities arising from the disaster .
The U.S. Justice Department could pursue a variety of civil and criminal charges against the companies involved in the spill .
Any penalties could be in the billions of dollars .
The ruptured well unleashed a torrent of crude that spewed until it was capped <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-07">three months later</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07-15">July 15</TIMEX3> , after 4.9 million barrels of oil had leaked into the sea .
The top U.S. official overseeing the spill response , retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-09-08">Wednesday</TIMEX3> that BP may not start the final ` ` kill '' of its well until mid - to <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-09" mod="END">late September</TIMEX3> .
The BP report , overseen by BP 's head of safety , Mark Bly , highlighted eight key failures that led to the blowout of the well and the subsequent explosion aboard the rig .
It defended BP 's much - criticized single - casing well design ; the use of fewer - than - recommended centralizers -LRB- devices used to ensure the cement casing is applied evenly around the well -RRB- ; and the decision to replace heavy drilling mud , which was keeping the well under control , with lighter water .
` ` It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident , '' said BP 's outgoing Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has faced withering criticism from U.S. lawmakers for initially playing down the scale of the disaster .
` ` HAPPY TO SLICE UP BLAME '' BP , which has seen almost $ 70 billion wiped off its market value since <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , is trying to rehabilitate its tarnished public image and restore investor confidence , spending millions of dollars on positive television and newspaper advertising .
` ` This report is not BP 's mea culpa , '' said Democratic congressman Edward Markey , an outspoken critic of BP 's handling of the disaster .
` ` Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one .
BP is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece . ''
Energy industry analysts were also not convinced by the BP findings , noting its investigators did not have access to everyone who had been involved in the project .
` ` Make no mistake , our view remains that this is BP 's well , and BP is in charge of design and execution , '' Houston energy investment boutique Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said in a note .
The BP investigation found fault with Transocean employees aboard the rig at the time of the accident .
` ` Over a 40 - minute period , the Transocean rig crew failed to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well , '' BP said .
But Transocean said BP was seeking to conceal the key factor that led to the rig explosion -- the well design .
` ` In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost - saving decisions that increased risk , '' it said .
Halliburton joined Transocean in rejecting the findings , saying the BP report contained ` ` substantial omissions and inaccuracies '' and stressed it was fully indemnified for any allegations in the document .
In pointing the finger at its contractors , BP said : -- Halliburton had used an ` ` unstable '' cement mixture that allowed hydrocarbons to leak into the well .
--
There was ` ` no indication '' that Transocean had tested the automatic shut - off function on the blowout preventer before it was used on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
-LRB- Blowout preventers are designed to halt all oil and gas flow and contain pressure if there is an uncontrollable gush from a seabed well .
-RRB- --
The rig crew diverted the flow of drilling mud and hydrocarbons into the wrong system after the blowout .
This meant gas vented onto the rig floor , rather than toward the sea , where it would have been less likely to cause a blast .
Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said the blowout preventer was ` ` inspected , tested and went through a rigorous maintenance schedule prior to being placed on the Macondo well and was then tested weekly , right up until <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P3D">72 hours</TIMEX3> prior to the blast . ''
` ` Any statement to the contrary is false , '' he said .
The damaged blowout preventer is key evidence in criminal and civil investigations of the blast .
BP retrieved it from the seabed on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-09-04">Saturday</TIMEX3> under watch of federal investigators and it is being sent to a NASA facility in Louisiana .

Get used to that phrase , you weasels .
I ' m just waiting for them to hit the cap on damages congress approved and flee !
Thank the U.S. Congress because they are really wonderful about protecting big business .
I feel ` ` so very '' greatful and so should you !
I do n't know what us little people would do without all their ` ` help . ''
Bush , Obama , and Congress have been such a great blessing to America .
Our future is so bright and life is just fine and dandy here .
Never mind that oil gushed everywhere , we have been dumping billions into pointless wars for <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> , unemployment is above 10 % in my state , the health system remains a mess , our schools are underfunded , and the infrastructure is corroding .
