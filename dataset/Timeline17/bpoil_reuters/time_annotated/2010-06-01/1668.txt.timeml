Does BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - familiar yellow - and - green sunflower logo need an update ?
Joe Daley thinks so .
As the founder of a website that acts as a clearinghouse for logo designers around the world , Daley reckons the British oil giant 's corporate icon should reflect the spreading oil spi ll in the Gulf of Mexico .
So Daley 's launched an online contest to find an appropriate replacement logo .
These kinds of logo competitions are nothing new ; that 's how the website works to match designers with businesses , with the businesses paying the prize to the winning design .
Daley himself put up the $ 200 in prize money for the BP logo redesign contest -- BP has nothing to do with it -- to raise awareness of the spill .
The idea evolved after he was chatting online with several designers about the BP oil spill , and a couple of them asked , ` ` What spill ? ''
` ` That 's when I decided to get it out in a more creative way , '' Daley said by telephone from Columbus , Ohio .
BP 's conduct before and after the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> Deepwater Horizon blowout prompted the move , Daley said .
` ` I ' ve been in business for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P12Y">12 years</TIMEX3> , and I know mistakes happen ...
but with the violations they ' ve had and not having a backup plan ... I ' m not very forgiving . ''
He offered some basic guidelines for designers , listing the ` ` top three things to communicate through our logo design : # 1 Oil spill disaster -- Toxic ; # 2 Death of wildlife ; # 3 Incompetence . ''
` ` The World . ''
The designers -- some 6,000 use the site , Daley said -- came through with some vivid ideas , putting red devil horns on the sunflower , reshaping the logo to mimic a biohazard icon and adding dripping black oil to the image .
The competition closes on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-12">June 12</TIMEX3> at <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-06-12T22:00">10 p.m.</TIMEX3> EDT .
Logo designers and the general public can vote to pick the winner .
