BP estimates oil spill up to 100,000 barrels per day in document BURAS , Louisiana | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Jun 20 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-20T19:19">7:19 pm</TIMEX3> EDT BURAS , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc estimates that a worst - case scenario rate for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could be about 100,000 barrels of oil per day , according to an internal company document released <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> by a senior U.S. congressional Democrat .
Its estimate of up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil per day is far higher than the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> U.S. government estimate of up to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- gushing daily from the ruptured offshore well into the sea .
BP spokesman Toby Odone said the document appeared to be genuine but the estimate applied only to a situation in which a key piece of equipment called a blowout preventer is removed .
` ` Since there are no plans to remove the blowout preventer , the number is irrelevant , '' he said .
The British energy giant , still struggling to stop a leak that began on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> and is causing an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , is planning to raise $ 50 billion to cover the cost of the largest oil spill in U.S. history , London 's <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times reported .
The oil spill is <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 62nd day and has dealt a blow to fishing and tourism industries across four Gulf states , soiling coastlines that are a playground for tourists and vital habitat for wildlife .
The amount of oil spurting from the well has been a matter of considerable controversy in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P2M">the past two months</TIMEX3> , with critics saying BP consistently understated the flow rate .
The internal BP document , which is undated , was released by U.S. Representative Ed Markey , chairman of a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
The document appears to estimate the highest potential flow of oil if key components of the well fail .
It does not indicate that the 100,000 barrels per day is BP 's estimate of the actual amount gushing from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well .
` ` Right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent , ''
Markey told NBC 's ` ` Meet the Press . ''
` ` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels . ''
But BP 's Odone said , ` ` I do n't think there 's been any underestimating .
We ' ve always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled and that 's exactly what we 're doing . ''
The document was posted on the Internet here London 's <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times , without citing any sources , said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the next two years</TIMEX3> to cover the cost of the spill .
BP said <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">last week</TIMEX3> it would suspend dividend payments to its shareholders and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> to offset liabilities from the spill , which began after an explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers .
The Financial Times reported BP is considering doubling the $ 10 billion asset sale program as part of a push to strengthen the company 's liquidity as it comes under financial pressure .
BP said 21,040 barrels of oil -LRB- 883,680 gallons\/3 .34 million liters -RRB-
-RRB- leaking from the well was collected by its siphoning systems <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-19">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
A large amount of oil continues to leak into the sea from the ruptured well a mile below the ocean surface despite the BP containment systems .
Kenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator appointed to run the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims for financial losses due to the oil spill , said he would make sure that ` ` every eligible , legitimate claim is paid and paid quickly . ''
Appearing on NBC 's ` ` Meet the Press , '' Feinberg rejected the complaint of a senior Republican congressman , Joe Barton , who said <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">last week</TIMEX3> that the fund set up by BP under pressure from President Barack Obama amounted to a government ` ` shakedown . ''
` ` I do n't think it helps to politicize this program , '' said Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer who dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">September 11 , 2001</TIMEX3> attacks .
` ` This a voluntary program .
No one is compelled to come into this fund . ''
Despite assurances of swift compensation , Louisiana Gulf residents remained skeptical .
` ` Every time they say there 's a fund for fisherman , we wait years and years , '' said Tal Plork , whose fisherman husband , Phan , faced long waits for aid after two hurricanes rampaged across the Gulf region in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
` ` It was like that for Gustav and Ike .
Hopefully <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they will go faster . ''
Plork , 42 , has had to go to work since the oil leak began because her husband 's fishing income has dried up .
She works at a cafeteria at the BP camp in Venice , Louisiana , and has been supporting her five children mainly on credit cards .
Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also appearing on ` ` Meet the Press , '' said he was anxious to see the well capped , the spill cleaned up and BP cover the entire cost .
` ` Nothing is satisfactory until the well is shut in .
When the well is capped , then clean up the oil , and then BP pays the bills .
Until all of that is done , nothing is satisfactory , '' said Barbour , a Republican .
Barbour said he thought the U.S. federal government ` ` has done more right than wrong '' in its handling of the disaster .
After falling 6.8 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">last week</TIMEX3> , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , their worst month since the <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="1987-10">October 1987</TIMEX3> market crash .
Despite the battering to its reputation and stock stemming from the disaster , hedge fund T2 Partners said it likes shares in the British oil firm , according to a Barron 's article published <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="2010-06-20">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
In a column titled ` ` Other Voices , '' T2 's managing partners said their reasons for <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> taking a new position in BP are that it is ` ` extraordinarily cheap , '' and that the firm is ` ` highly likely '' to be able to cover clean - up , damages , fines and lawsuits relating to the disaster .

Nobody thought it was insensitive of Obama to vacation in an $ 8 m house after his inauguration , when so many people lived in their car because of the great recession .
I ' m sure , the people in Iraq and Afghanistan would also like to get their life back after the US invasions for no more real purpose than : oil .
20 Billion $ for the oil clean up ?
It 's for the U.S. Government to embezzle .
Very little of that money will make it to the Gulf victims .
Do you know who is going to pay for the oil clean up ?
Yep , We will probably pay a couple of bucks per a gallon more at the pump in <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> or two .
Most of that 20 billion dollars will end up in some off shore bank and then in the pockets of who knows who ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
