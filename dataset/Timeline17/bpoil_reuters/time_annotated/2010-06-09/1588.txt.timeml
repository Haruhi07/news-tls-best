PENSACOLA BEACH , Florida -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Gary Chernekoff does n't own a restaurant , is n't a charter boat captain and does n't work for a hotel or resort .
A plumber by trade , the Pensacola , Florida resident expected to have a busy and profitable <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> .
He had three big jobs lined up -- vacation homes being built in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">this summer</TIMEX3> tourist haven on the coast of the Florida Panhandle .
It was more than enough work for a one - man operation .

But the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that began in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> depriving Chernekoff of his source of income .
Unsure how deeply the spill would affect the market for $ 5,000 - a - week time shares , investors stopped work on the projects .
Chernekoff suddenly found himself without a job .
` ` I ' m telling you , that was a kick in the pants , '' said Chernekoff , who is trying to seek compensation from British energy giant BP Plc . .
As state and BP officials respond to the biggest oil spill in U.S. history , Chernekoff 's predicament is echoed across Florida 's Gulf Coast .
One economist calculated the state could lose up to 195,000 jobs and nearly $ 11 billion in economic activity from the prolonged impact of oil washing up on Florida shores .
So far , only a few northwest Florida beaches have been littered with tar balls .
The hotels remain relatively full along the Florida Panhandle , a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> tourist destination for many U.S. residents within driving distance from Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , Arkansas and Louisiana .
But economic development officials are eyeing the Gulf and bracing for higher concentrations of oil that would shut down their beaches and send travelers elsewhere .
` ` I talked to some hotel folks and it looks like they were packed over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-W22-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , '' said Buck Lee , director of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , as he toured Pensacola Beach <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-W23">this week</TIMEX3> .
` ` The question is : how long will it last ? ''
Long before Walt Disney Co made its mark in Florida , tourists came to the ` ` Sunshine State '' for its beaches .
The tourism industry pumps more than $ 60 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> into the state economy .
Gulf Coast communities are even more dependent upon the seasonal industry , which in northern Florida peaks in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> months .
Economist Sean Snaith , who directs the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida in Orlando , said a conservative estimate has the state losing at least $ 2.2 billion in revenue and 39,000 jobs .
That 's assuming a 10 percent decline in employment and output in tourism - related business in the 23 counties on the Florida Gulf Coast .
If the impact becomes more severe or prolonged , dropping employment and output in half , Snaith said the state could lose nearly $ 11 billion in business activity and more than 195,00 jobs .
That would be a body blow to a state just recovering from a housing market crash and suffering high unemployment .
He acknowledges that exact numbers are difficult to nail down .
` ` A hurricane passes through and it 's a limited duration event .
There 's damage and you can figure it out , '' Snaith said .
` ` Here , we do n't know when -LRB- the oil -RRB- is going to arrive or how long it 's going to stay .
To use a hurricane analogy , we do n't know what category it 's going to be . ''
His calculations did not take into account predictions that ocean currents could carry the oil around to Florida 's Atlantic Coast as well as the Gulf .
State tourism officials have been trying to spread the word that most Florida beaches remain untainted by the spill .
It 's a moving target .
In Perdido Key , off Florida 's Panhandle , local health officials on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-08">Tuesday</TIMEX3> posted notices on the beaches telling visitors not to swim .
It was the first such advisory posted for Florida beaches because of the oil spill .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="TIME" value="2010-06-09TMO">Wednesday morning</TIMEX3> , however , tar balls were few and far between and no oil sheen was present .
Florida marketing officials are tailoring their messages to would - be tourists and offering live beach updates on the state 's website , www.visitflorida.com .
Local economic development officials are doing the same , but it 's hard to compete with around - the - clock media coverage of a story with global interest .
` ` There is a whole lot of anxiety and a lot of concern , '' said Chris Thompson , president and CEO of VisitFlorida , the state 's tourist marketing arm .
` ` Our battle is to separate the misperceptions from reality . ''
Bill Stromquist , treasurer of the Perdido Key Area Chamber of Commerce in northwest Florida , said local booster efforts were being hurt by tourism officials in other states .
During a <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> road trip down the U.S. eastern seaboard , Stromquist said he stopped at state - run visitor information stations in each state along the way .
In each place , he was told incorrectly that Florida beaches were closed .
` ` They 're killing us and I do n't know how to fix it , '' Stromquist told state tourism representatives on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` People are canceling before they get the information that the beaches are clean . ''
A state - run advertising campaign paid for by $ 25 million in BP cash appears to be helping fill rooms in the Panhandle region .
The BP - backed effort , which was criticized for taking too long to begin , follows advertisements paid for by the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association .
State officials have been trying to respond .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Monday</TIMEX3> , Florida Governor Charlie Crist launched a state - run program that will provide low - interest loans of up to $ 25,000 for businesses affected by the spill .
BP so far has paid nearly $ 50 million in lost - income claims across Gulf states , including more than $ 6 million in Florida .
Officials are also considering measures to provide property tax credits and to relax sales tax collection rules in an effort to help businesses address cash - flow problems brought on by the unexpected dip in revenue .
` ` This has caught a lot of businesses off guard , especially for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-05">May</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June</TIMEX3> , '' said Lisa Echeverri , executive director of the Florida Department of Revenue .
` ` There are a number of things we can do to help businesses . ''
Meanwhile , local officials must still contend with cost - conscious travelers trying to make the most out of their <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-SU">summer</TIMEX3> break .
` ` If I ' m spending $ 3,000 for a vacation , I ' m not going where there are any too many ` ifs , ' ''
Stromquist said .
