NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Jun 9 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2010-06-09T19:24">7:24 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc -LRB- BP .
N -RRB- -LRB- BP .
L -RRB- shares tumbled nearly 16 percent on U.S. exchanges to a 14 - year low on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> on rising fears about how the wounded company will cope with the massive costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster .
The stock has <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> lost more than half its value since the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion that sank a BP - contracted rig and led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
A steady flow of worsening news about the damage to the Gulf Coast environment and BP 's reputation , along with the potential liability and political fallout , has cast doubt on the British company 's ability to shoulder the burden .
The dramatic sell - off on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> added grist to the mill for corporate restructuring experts wondering about BP 's long - term viability , while other analysts pointed to an evaporation of investors ' patience .
` ` The confidence in BP being able to stop the oil leak and deal with the ecological aftermath has disappeared , '' said Joe Kinahan , chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade .
Concerns about BP having to halt its dividend contributed to the selling , and the U.S. Justice Department said late on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> it was concerned about planned payouts from BP and Transocean Ltd RIGN .
S , owner of the lost rig .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the past two days</TIMEX3> alone , seven analysts have cut their expectations on the likely payout from BP .
BP believes it may be heading for a showdown with the U.S. government over ever - increasing demands to cover the costs of the spill , according to a company source .
` ` The United States ' government is very mad at BP , '' said Jon Burnham , head of Burnham Securities , who sold his BP shares on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-06-07">Monday</TIMEX3> .
` ` They are <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in the position of appearing to buck the president , and I do n't think the market likes that much . ''
BP 's New York - traded shares headed sharply lower at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07T13:30" mod="APPROX">about 1:30 p.m.</TIMEX3> EDT -LRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="TIME" value="2010-06-07T17:30">1730 GMT</TIMEX3> -RRB- , after an article appeared on Fortune magazine 's website quoting high - profile oil analyst Matthew Simmons , who raised questions about the company 's liability for the oil spill and its ability to survive the crisis .
BP 's depositary shares closed at $ 29.20 , down $ 5.46 on the New York Stock Exchange , the lowest closing level since <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1996-08-14">August 14 , 1996</TIMEX3> .
Earlier , the company 's stock fell 4 percent in London trading .
` ` I still feel like they can , but there 's more doubt in my mind than there was <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">a week ago</TIMEX3> , '' Weiss said .
` ` Momentum is a powerful thing . ''
The company had said on a conference call with analysts on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> that it has ` ` plenty '' of cash to deal with the problem , and the Obama administration has made similar comments as the company grapples with clean - up in the Gulf .
A BP spokesman said ` ` nothing has changed '' since <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-06-04">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Restructuring experts agreed that by running the numbers alone , BP looked like it could handle the financial damage .
Brad Sandler , a bankruptcy attorney with Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones in Wilmington , Delaware , said the likelihood of a BP bankruptcy was ` ` probably remote '' because of its access to credit , solid cash flow and a healthy balance sheet .
BP reported about $ 27 billion of cash flow from operations in <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> and total liabilities amounted to about 56 percent of total assets on its balance sheet of about $ 235 billion .
Stephen Lubben , a law professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark , New Jersey , added that the potentially massive liability bill was not large relative to BP 's size .
` ` You could add $ 50 billion of debt to their balance sheet and they would still be solvent , from an accounting perspective , '' he said .
But Lubben noted that situation could change depending on whether creditors and banks get nervous and cut off BP 's access to funds , even if there was no sign of that <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Investors who bet on such events are already eyeing that possibility .
BP Plc 's debt protection costs leaped 106 basis points on <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to 368 basis points , or $ 368,000 per year to insure $ 10 million in debt for <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> , according to Markit Intraday .
Option - implied volatility for BP hit an all - time high , as traders brace for the likelihood for more downside in the stock price in the months to come , said Jon Najarian , a founder of Web information site optionMonster.com in Chicago .
` ` It is not just a rumor about the potential of a dividend cut in BP anymore , '' Najarian said .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> it 's about the survivability of the company . ''
Other stocks associated with the Gulf spill were hit hard .
N -RRB- fell 8.1 percent to $ 42.58 , having earlier traded at its lowest level in <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DURATION" value="P5Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than five years</TIMEX3> .

N -RRB- , part owner of the blown - out well , lost 18.6 percent to $ 34.83 a share .

<TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they want people that own stock in BP to help pay for the accident by suspending -LRB- for who knows how long -RRB-
their dividend .
Maybe they should cut their pay once in awhile instead of giving themselves a raise and at the same time freezing social security cost of living increases to help pay for the accident .
I think they forgot that BP and others involved carry insurance for such accidents and have enough cash flow to survive .
You need to stay out of business and leave business to people that know business and not law .
Where were these ` experts ' in corporate finance when the mortgage agencies were taking incalculable risks and saddling the citizenry with obligations for decades to come ?
I guess we 're resigned to watching them constantly force the limelight away from their monumental failures of stewardship .
I remember , Clinton told the banks to loan to anyone that got paid -LRB- $ 2,000.00 <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> -RRB- a $ 2500.00 <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> mortgage .
And to do so the underwriters got paid off to do so .
