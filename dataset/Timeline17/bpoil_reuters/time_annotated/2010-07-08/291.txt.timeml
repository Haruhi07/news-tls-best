BP aims to fix leaking oil well by <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> : report Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-07-08">Jul 8 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-07-08T01:29">1:29 am</TIMEX3> EDT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Besieged energy giant BP Plc aims to fix its leaking Gulf oil well by <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> , ahead of its earlier target of mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , to show investors it has limited its burgeoning oil spill liabilities , the Wall Street Journal said , citing company officials .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> target date is the day the company is due to report second - quarter earnings and will speak to investors , the Journal said .
` ` In a perfect world with no interruptions , it is possible to be ready to stop the well between <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-07-20">July 20</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-07-27">July 27</TIMEX3> , '' the head of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration unit Bob Dudley told the newspaper in an interview .
However , Dudley said this ` ` perfect case '' is threatened by the hurricane season and is ` ` unlikely . ''
BP could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours .
BP shares have fallen by half since its well blew out in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state .
The Journal said BP is also preparing a series of backup plans in case its <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> operations go awry .
Citing company and administration officials , the paper said BP 's plan include connecting the rogue well to existing pipelines in two nearby underwater gas and oil fields .
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-07-07">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , part of a quest for cash to ward off takeovers and help pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
BP 's shares closed up nearly 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange , buoyed by investor relief the company had said it does not plan to issue new equity , and speculation the worst is behind for what they see as an underpriced energy giant .

Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Therefore no fix appears possible .
Therefore they will have to build a phony double wellhead to fool everyone that it is fixed .
` ` Not possible ? ''
OK
I ' m just crazy .
Mark and confirm the GPS coordinates of the actual existing broken BOP\/wellhead <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
US govt will block access to site .
Quote : ` ` I am doubtful there is a technology to install any sort of a blocking tap fitting into the Y connection at the shaft junction once the second hole is completed . ''
No , there just gone pump some ` mud ' in it .
Just like the ` Top Kill ' operation , only <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they inject it from the bottom .
If it sticks or stay there , then they will pump concrete in it .
So , the weight of the ` mud ' and the water column must be ` MORE ' than the force of the oil .

But i ' m no oil expert .

But i have seen more than 10 EVA 's -LRB- Extravehicular Activity -RRB- from NASA .
And they look a lot more professional than these guys with there ROV 's .
But they also have the biggest swimming pool of the world to test EVA 's .
BP only has the swimming pool of the ceo 's to swim in !

And NASA uses CANADARM robotic arm 's and not floating devices in space like a ROV .
A ROV ca n't turn a bolt , it only will turn it self .
A robotic arm can turn a bolt beqause the use of ` Power Data Grapple Fixture ' -LRB- PDGF -RRB- .
I think these ` oil guys ' are not very smart or educated , like the people from nasa or cern .
BP is bankrupt bound ! ! !
There are generations of families who are devastated by the oil spill and the ravages it is having on the eco system .
Is it realistic that BP can support such families over the <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PXY">many years</TIMEX3> it will take before it is safe to harvest fish in the area ? ? ?
Can BP support these families for 15 plus years ?
NO is the answer .
BP can NOT survive ! ! !
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
