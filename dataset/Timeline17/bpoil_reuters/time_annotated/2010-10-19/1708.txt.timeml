WILMINGTON , Delaware | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-10-19">Oct 19 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-10-19T10:28">10:28 am</TIMEX3> EDT WILMINGTON , Delaware -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc told a court it was committed to waiving the legal cap on its liability from the Gulf oil spill , which could have limited the cost to the oil giant to $ 75 million plus clean - up costs .
` ` BP has chosen to waive the statutory limitation on liability under OPA , '' BP said in a court filing on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-18">Monday</TIMEX3> .
OPA is the Oil Pollution Act of <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> .
BP has already paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to fisherman , retailers , charter boat captains and property owners who suffered from the spill , the largest in U.S. history .
The company has publicly committed to pay clean - up costs and all ` ` legitimate claims , '' rather than applying the cap .
Under pressure from the Obama administration , the company also has established a $ 20 billion compensation fund , but a slew of lawsuits also have been brought against the company and its business partners .
At a court hearing on the lawsuits on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-10-15">Friday</TIMEX3> , BP created confusion about its stance on the liability cap .
It did not commit to waiving the cap at the hearing , as many plaintiffs ' attorneys had expected , and said in a statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-10-15">Friday</TIMEX3> that the cap ` ` is not relevant . ''
` ` BP lawyers would n't say on the record they would waive the cap , '' said Steve Herman , a Louisiana attorney who is leading the hundreds of lawsuits against BP and its partners .
` ` It certainly took everyone by surprise . ''
In <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-10-18">Monday</TIMEX3> 's court filing , BP said it would waive the liability cap .
BP also urged other defendants in the case , including rig owner Transocean Holdings LLC , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and MOEX Offshore <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> LLC , also to waive the liability cap , according to the filing .
BP also said it reserved the right to seek reimbursement from the other defendants and denied engaging in grossly negligent conduct , which would open the door to potentially huge punitive damages .
