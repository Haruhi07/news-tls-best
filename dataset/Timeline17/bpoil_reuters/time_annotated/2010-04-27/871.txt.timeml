BP s CEO Tony Hayward reckons the $ 100 million cost of drilling a well to divert the flow from a leaking oil well in the Gulf of Mexico is the biggest hit the oil major will take in the Deepwater Horizon tragedy .
The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-W16">last week</TIMEX3> , and sank , with the loss of 11 workers , who are <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> presumed dead , while the well it was drilling is leaking 1,000 barrels of crude <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> into the sea .
Investors will hope Hayward is right but BP s record on estimating the costs of major accidents gives rise for concern .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , when an explosion at BP s Texas City refinery killed 15 workers , BP initially scoffed at analyst estimates the cost of repairs , lost profits and damages could hit $ 1 billion .
Spokespeople predicted the impact would be a fraction of that .
In the end , compensation claims cost over $ 2 billion while repair costs and lost profits cost over $ 1 billion more .
Investors may have this in mind when they pushed BP s shares down around 3 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the past 2 days</TIMEX3> , wiping over $ 5 billion off the company s market capitalization , despite the company reporting a forecast - busting <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-Q1">first quarter</TIMEX3> earnings rise .
