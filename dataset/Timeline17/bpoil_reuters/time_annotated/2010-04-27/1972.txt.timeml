Crisis control is an art , as BP knows all too well .
The UK oil and gas major is sparing nothing in dealing with the fatal explosion on a Gulf of Mexico oil rig .
Tony Hayward , the chief executive , has deployed 32 ships , two rigs , five airplanes and over 1,000 people .
That may seem excessive for a relatively small spill , estimated at 1,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , but too much is better than too little .
Mr. Hayward is clearly worried about BP 's reputation , which had been badly damaged when he took the job <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2007">three years ago</TIMEX3> .
In both a <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> explosion in the company s Texas City refinery and problems in an Alaskan pipeline , BP was directly responsible and partly at fault .
This case looks different : the rig was operated by Swiss contractor Transocean and the problem appears to have been technical , the failure of a key piece of equipment , the blowout preventer .
But even if this accident was extremely bad luck -- the blowout preventer is supposed to be fool - proof -- BP designed the project and is ultimately responsible for the clean - up .
That might take months and cost as much as $ 200 million , including the expense of drilling a relief well .
In addition , there could be lawsuits .
Investors seem to see even worse damages .
They have wiped more than 6 billion pounds the company 's market capitalization since the spill , despite strong quarterly results .
A big worry is that the spill provokes a public backlash on deep sea drilling , which is the new frontier in oil and gas exploration .
It is hard enough to contain an oil spill on land , but it is much harder depths of 5,000 feet .
There are n't any precedents for this kind of spill at those depths .
The explosion gives ammunition to anti - oil environmentalists , just when President Barack Obama is considering expanding offshore drilling .
The desire to prevent a political explosion helps explain BP 's aggressive response .
Mr. Hayward may have cleaned up company 's deeper problems , but he stills needs maximal damage limitation , for the sake of BP and the whole industry .
That requires is a swift clean - up , and no more freak accidents .
It amazes me to see how disjointed the oil industry is when needing to get their message out , whether it 's to explain issues around exploration and production or address catastrophes like the fire and spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
They all still communicate like it 's <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="195">the 1950s</TIMEX3>
and it 's almost always in crisis mode .
Maybe <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXD">some day</TIMEX3> they 'll learn that by providing facts about E&P and addressing the potential issues , costs , benefits , dangers ...
they 'll be able to put a better message out about why these events , even though disastrous , are so rare and how they constantly work for a safer working environment and a smaller environmental footprint .
Their lack of understanding when it comes to communications leaves them wide open for criticism at times like these .
Why have BP and Transocean not been out front to mobilize employees and volunteers to assist along the coastlines and sensitive environmental areas ?
Have they held any public meetings in the coastal communities ?
Yes , they are focusing on trying to stop the flow of oil but they 're big boys and they can do more than one thing at a time , especially when it comes to the environment they want to operate in .
If we are going to explore in water we need to have foolproof methods of controlling mishaps .
They are saying this spill is up to 5,000 barrels <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> and it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P90D">90 days</TIMEX3> to stop the flow !
The damage it may cause in environmentally sensitive areas of Louisiana and over to Florida is n't easily contained or cleaned up !
I think they will get the clean up done and minimize damage .
I think the fact that it is in a warm water area makes it easier .
It takes time to figure out exactly how to fix the problem and clean up is a matter of getting enough equipment there to get it cleaned up .
Please also do not forget that a pipeline owned by a BP subsidiary exploded near Bellingham , WA in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="1999">1999</TIMEX3> and killed 3 people .
It could have been even worse than it was .
The subsidiary was found at fault .
BP appears to have a systemic problem with managing and mitigating risk .
<TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-04-27">Today</TIMEX3> 's article in the Wall Street Journal -LRB- 4 - 29 - <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> -RRB- summed up the problem here in the US .
Apparently Norway and Brazil require the use of an acoustic switch on the blow out preventer valve in addition to the cable from the control room on the drilling rig .

The acoustic switch which can be activated remotely as a back up system to close the valve .
It costs about $ 500,000 which is about 0.10 % of the cost of the drilling rig that was lost and <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PT2H" mod="APPROX">about 2 hours</TIMEX3> worth of clean - up reported to <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> be $ 6,000,000 per day .
My 13 year old grand daughter read the WSJ article and said ` ` It was a poor decision not to have the acoustic switch installed to shut off the blowout valve on the rig '' .
I wonder why the US Mineral Management engineers could not come to the same conclusion ?
Could it be the decisions in all US Government Agencies are made by industry lobbyists based on saving a few dollars and are not based on good engineering practices to protect life , property and the environment ?
