NEW YORK | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-09-30">Sep 30 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-09-30T19:09">7:09 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - University researchers said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-09-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> they <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> found alarming levels of cancer - causing toxins in an area of the Gulf of Mexico affected by BP 's oil spill , raising the specter of long - lasting health concerns .
Oregon State University -LRB- OSU -RRB- researchers found sharply heightened levels of chemicals including carcinogens in the waters off the coast of Louisiana in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> , the last sampling date , even after BP successfully capped its runaway Gulf well in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> .
Near Grand Isle , Louisiana , the team discovered that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -LRB- PAHs -RRB- -- which include carcinogens and chemicals that pose various risks to human health -- remained at levels 40 times higher than before the area was affected by the oil spill .
The compounds may enter the food chain through organisms like plankton or fish , a researcher said .
` ` In a natural environment a 40 - fold increase is huge , '' said Oregon State toxicologist Kim Anderson , who led the research .
` ` We do n't usually see that at other contamination sites . ''
The PAH chemicals , which are often linked to oil spills , are most concentrated in the area near the Louisiana Coast , but levels have also jumped 2 to 3 fold in other spill - affected areas off Alabama , Mississippi and Florida , Anderson said .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-08">last month</TIMEX3> , PAH levels remained near those discovered while the oil spill was still flowing heavily , Anderson said .
The team will continue to sample for chemicals in months to come .
Although BP has sealed its well , experts are still cataloging the environmental and health hazards left in the wake of the spill .
Scores of research teams , including Anderson 's , are working with Federal Superfund grants to measure how the spill affected the environment .
Also on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-09-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Arizona Congressman Raul Grijalva told Reuters he would press for a congressional investigation into whether estimates of the oil spill volume and its related environmental risks were misrepresented in a federal report from <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> .
BP 's ill - fated Macondo well spilled a total of up to 4.9 million barrels before it was capped , the report said .
But it also suggested that most of the oil had been dispersed naturally or removed by clean - up efforts at the time .
Grijalva , who chairs a subcommittee that oversees some wetlands damaged by the spill , said it was unclear whether the Federal report was peer - reviewed and whether its estimates remain accurate .
` ` I do n't want to let BP off the hook , and my suspicion is that the numbers may be wrong and that the oil is still a danger , '' Grijalva said in an interview .
BP representatives were not immediately available for comment .
