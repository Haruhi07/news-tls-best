An oil sheen is seen on the water at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">May 27 2010</TIMEX3> .
WASHINGTON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11">Jan 11 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2011-01-11T17:42">5:42 pm</TIMEX3> EST WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - A White House panel probing BP 's massive oil spill called for an overhaul of a regulatory system that was ` ` entirely unprepared '' for disaster and outlined stringent , new oversight , a plan sure to face opposition from Republicans reluctant to expand government involvement .

The White House oil spill commission said in its final major report that the U.S. government needs to expand its drilling regulations , as well as set up an independent drilling safety agency .
` ` None of the major aspects of offshore drilling safety -- not the regulatory oversight , not the industry safety standards , not the spill response practices -- kept pace with the push into deepwater , '' said commission co - chair Bill Reilly .
` ` In effect , our nation was entirely unprepared for an inevitable disaster , '' he said .
Many of the recommendations would require Congressional approval , however , and Republicans have been critical of extensive new regulations , saying they would further slow the exploratory pace following <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010">last year</TIMEX3> 's drilling moratorium that was imposed in response to the spill .
Republican lawmaker Fred Upton , who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee , blasted the commission 's findings , saying they failed to clearly identify the root cause of the ` ` unprecedented disaster . ''
` ` Neither this nor any investigation should be used as political justification for a pre - determined agenda to limit affordable energy options for America , '' Upton said in a statement .
Oil companies have voiced concerns that onerous new regulations could hamper offshore exploration and drive up oil prices .
U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production fell by 70,000 barrels per day in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-Q4">fourth quarter of 2010</TIMEX3> , with further drops expected <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011">this year</TIMEX3> and in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012">2012</TIMEX3> .
But Reilly said it was time for Congress ` ` to exercise serious oversight '' in a regime that has not kept pace with the industry 's push into deeper and deeper waters .
As a first step , he demanded that Congress provide the funding to hire additional government inspectors for drilling operations .
Following the BP accident , the Interior Department restructured the agency responsible for overseeing drilling and has instituted a raft of new safety rules .
` ` We have already implemented several of the key reforms the commission has made clear are necessary , and we will use the commission 's report and the findings of other investigations to inform future actions to strengthen safety and oversight , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .
The seven - member commission also pushed for the oil industry to create a self - regulating entity to help enforce standards and called on Congress to raise liability limits on offshore drilling operators .
Modeled on the nuclear industry 's Institute of Nuclear Power Operations , a self - regulatory group would allow offshore drillers to hold their counterparts more accountable , the commission said in its final report .
While not calling for a halt to drilling in the Arctic , the commission said there is need for more study of the intense physical conditions and Interior should ensure that companies have adequate plans and resources to handle a spill there .
The commission was created by President Barack Obama after an <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion ruptured BP 's underwater Macondo well , killing 11 workers in the Gulf of Mexico and leading to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history .
The commission is the first government - sanctioned group to wrap up its probe of the causes of the BP accident .
Its report contains few surprises , as it mirrors many statements and reports released by the panel <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P6M" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past six months</TIMEX3> .
Although the commission lacks the authority to establish drilling policies or punish companies , its findings could influence future court proceedings and energy policy .
Paul Sankey , an analyst with Deutsche Bank Oil , said he thinks U.S. offshore activity will be lower in the aftermath of the spill .
` ` The broadness of these recommendations and lack of specifics will delay activity , '' Sankey said .
Still , despite these concerns from the industry , Chevron Corp greenlit plans to invest nearly $ 12 billion in two major deepwater Gulf projects <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010" mod="END">late last year</TIMEX3> .
The American Petroleum Institute criticized the panel 's report for casting doubt on the entire oil industry based on a single accident .
` ` This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety , '' said API Upstream Director Erik Milito .
The PHLX oil service index jumped 2.3 percent on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-01-11">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , outperforming the tepid gains of 0.5 percent in the broader S&P 500 index .
The sector , which has largely been on a climb since <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-09" mod="START">early September</TIMEX3> , is nearing the highest point since <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2008-09">September 2008</TIMEX3> .
Cameron International Corp , which made the blowout preventer on the BP well , drove the equipment sector index higher with gains of more than 4 percent in afternoon trading .
BP added nearly 3 percent , while Halliburton gained 3.2 percent and Transocean rose 2.3 percent .

` ` There is ... a profound problem with federal government limits on liability .
That is central planning gone mad .

The liability for environmental damage should be 100 % at least .
Such a system would match a company 's policies to the actual risk of doing damage .
Lower limits would inspire companies to be less concerned about damage to others than they should be , in the same way that a company with a bailout guarantee faces a moral hazard to be less efficient than it would be in a free market . ''
