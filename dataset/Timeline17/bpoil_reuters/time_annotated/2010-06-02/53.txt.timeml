HOUSTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Jun 2 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-02T14:42">2:42 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP CEO Tony Hayward , on the front lines of his company 's battle to contain the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill , apologized on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-02">Wednesday</TIMEX3> for saying he wants ` ` my life back . ''
Hayward , who has been thrust into a media spotlight since an <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> rig explosion that killed 11 workers and caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history , said in a statement he was appalled when he read his comment .
The BP chief had remarked ` ` I want my life back , '' to several news organizations , including Reuters , in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` I made a hurtful and thoughtless comment , '' Hayward said in a statement .
` ` I apologize , especially to the families of the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident .
Those words do n't represent how I feel about this tragedy . ''
` ` My first priority is doing all we can to restore the lives of the people of the Gulf region and their families - to restore their lives , not mine , '' he added .
Hayward 's ` ` life back '' gaffe was not the first by the plain - speaking and press - shy geologist at the helm of the oil giant .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-18">May 18</TIMEX3> , he told Britain 's Sky News : ` ` I think the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to have been very , very modest . ''
Hayward and BP executives have been challenged with the comment -- made before oil hit the Gulf shore -- regularly since in television interviews in the United States , where the spill is dominating the national news .
As much as 19,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 800,000 gallons or 3 million liters -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> has been pouring into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana , threatening fisheries , wildlife and beaches along a coastline that stretches to Florida .
In an interview with the Guardian newspaper published on <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-14">May 14</TIMEX3> , Hayward said : ` ` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' ''
That remark was typical of the technically accurate comments Hayward makes , which -- particularly when abbreviated -- have led critics to charge that BP is trying to play down the environmental damage .
An abbreviation of the Guardian quote , where Hayward simply refers to the spill as ` ` tiny , '' also regularly features in news reports .
BP is beefing up its public relations effort to deal with the spill .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-W22">This week</TIMEX3> a former campaign press aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney started as BP 's U.S. spokesperson .
That hire raised some eyebrows , given critics of Cheney -- a one - time chief executive of oil field services firm Halliburton -- associate the former vice president with what they see as excessively close ties between the government and Big Oil under former Republican President George W. Bush .
