Hollywood Reporter -RRB- -
In the midst of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by BP drilling rig , Deepwater Horizon , a number of news outlets got a bunch of yuks with news that Kevin Costner was the potential savior for the crisis -- that his company , CINC -LRB- ` ` Costner in Nevada Corporation '' -RRB- , had developed a technology that separated oil from water .
In a new lawsuit filed in Louisiana District Court on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-12-22">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , actor Stephen Baldwin and a friend named Spyridon Contogouris claim they were tricked into selling shares of the company that marketed CINC 's technology .
According to the complaint , Contogouris was approached in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="200" mod="START">the early 2000s</TIMEX3> by Costner 's representatives to market the actor 's technology to various customers .
He says he entered into an agreement in which he would receive a commission on sales of units .
Flash forward to <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-04-17">April 17 , 2010</TIMEX3> .
Costner and Contogouris had a meal together in Biloxi , Mississippi , where Costner 's band , Modern West , was playing a gig .
By that time , says the complaint , Costner 's attempts to market his technology had proven unsuccessful , and he sold all his rights and ownership in CINC to a man named Bret Shelton .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P3D">Three days</TIMEX3> after Costner and Contogouris had gotten together , Deepwater Horizon exploded , which would eventually lead to the leak of nearly 5 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before the wellhead was capped .
Contogouris knew it was a big opportunity for CINC .
He says he attempted to contact Costner , but could n't , because the actor was filming a movie in Canada .
Instead , Contogouris spoke to one of Costner 's friends , who advised him that the actor 's stock in the company had already been sold .
So Contogouris spoke with Shelton , and then tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with BP .
<TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> , Baldwin enters the picture .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , Contogouris and Baldwin got together in New Orleans with a local attorney , John Houghtaling , and discussed making a documentary film based on the BP oil spill .
Costner 's technology was then discussed .
Houghtaling mentioned he could make an introduction to BP , and before long , a joint venture agreement was confected between Baldwin , Contogouris , Houghtaling , and others to market the CINC technology to BP .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">May 13</TIMEX3> , the joint venture , Ocean Therapies Solutions -LRB- OTS -RRB- , signed an agreement with CINC , whereby Contogouris got a 28 percent ownership and Baldwin got a 10 percent ownership in the new company .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-13">That same day</TIMEX3> , BP agreed to test the CINC technology for possible use in cleaning up the Deepwater Horizon spill .
Members of the joint venture , OTS , began disagreeing about how to license the technology to BP -- whether it should be a long - term relationship or a one - time sale for a ` ` quick kill '' of the Gulf of Mexico disaster .

Plus , there was said to be a falling out over the failed documentary about the oil spill , which soon resulted in a separate lawsuit .
The disagreements threatened to blow up OTS , until Costner got involved again , testifying before Congress on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-09">June 9</TIMEX3> about his technology .
Soon after that , BP agreed to meet .

But Contogouris and Baldwin claim in their new lawsuit that they were purposefully excluded from the meeting with BP , which resulted in an $ 18 million deposit for a larger purchase price of the technology .
Contogouris and Baldwin say they were kept out of the loop about this money and were instead told that BP had placed no such order .
Having believed that OTS had failed , Contogouris says he sold his interest in CINC 's new partner company .
It 's alleged that the money that came from BP was used by Costner and one of his associates to buy Contogouris and Baldwin out of their interest in the venture .
The deal was executed on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-06-11">June 11</TIMEX3> in a ` ` Transfer , Withdrawal , Release and Indemnity Agreement '' whereby Contogouris gave up his 28 % share and Baldwin gave up his 10 % share in OTS for about $ 2 million total .
<TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P1D">A day</TIMEX3> later , BP purchased 32 units of the CINC technology for a gross price alleged to be in excess of $ 52 million .
<TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="P2D">Two days</TIMEX3> after that , Costner and his associates\/co - defendants ` ` clandestinely , secretly and wrongfully caused an unauthorized bank account to be opened '' without the knowledge of Contogouris and Baldwin .
The account was allegedly used by Costner and an associate as ` ` their own personal piggy bank . ''
The plaintiffs say they did n't discover what had happened , how they had been supposedly tricked out of their involvement in OTS , until mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> .
They are <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> suing for securities fraud and misrepresentation .
Contogouris claims $ 10.64 million in damages .
Baldwin claims $ 3.8 million in damages .

I like Stephan Baldwin !
He 's the good Baldwin !
But this is a non - story .
Even if everything said here is true ; and seems unlikely .
Baldwin and his greek friend should be , and probably are embarrassed about making bad business decisions .
When you make snap business decisions like the ones described here you risk everything -- you 're all in .

And you can lose .
If this goes forward and they lose they should have to pay legal expenses .
