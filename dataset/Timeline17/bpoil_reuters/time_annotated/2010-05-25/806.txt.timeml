The Trans - Alaska Pipeline , partly owned by BP , shut down on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> after spilling several thousand barrels of crude oil into backup containers , drastically cutting supply down the main artery between refineries and Alaska 's oilfields .
The accident comes at a difficult time for BP -- the largest single owner of the pipeline operator , holding 47 percent -- as it struggles to plug a gushing Gulf of Mexico oil well .
The shutdown followed a series of mishaps that resulted from a scheduled fire - command system test at Pump Station 9 , about 100 miles south of Fairbanks , said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co , the operator of the 800 - mile oil line .
The power outage triggered opening of relief valves , causing an unspecified volume of crude oil to overflow a storage tank into a secondary containment .
There were no injuries , but the approximately 40 people at the work site were evacuated , Alyeska spokeswoman Michele Egan said .
North Slope oil producers have cut their flow into the pipeline 's Prudhoe Bay intake station to 16 percent of their normal rates , Egan said .
There is enough storage capacity to allow the line to be shut down for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P2D">48 hours</TIMEX3> as long as producers maintain the 16 percent flow rate , she said .
It is unclear how long the shutdown will last .
` ` We 're going to take as long as we need to make sure the site is safe before we start back up , '' Egan said .
Supply problems in the pipeline potentially disrupt tanker shipments to refineries .
The volume of spilled oil is unknown .
` ` We ' ve estimated the spill is several thousand barrels , '' she said .
All has been held within the secondary containment , which has capacity to hold 104,500 barrels , she said .
The amount spilled is ` ` nowhere near '' the containment area 's capacity , she added .
Alyeska is a consortium owned by five oil companies .
Major owners are BP , ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil .
Unocal and Koch hold minor shares .
The Trans - Alaska Pipeline , which runs from Prudhoe Bay to the tanker port of Valdez , normally ships about 667,000 barrels of oil daily .

Never mind that the pipeline has 5 owners other than BP , and none of the owners , including BP , operate the pipeline .
Then again , ` ` Alyeska Pipeline Service Co operated Alaska oil pipeline shut after spill '' would n't have gotten as many clicks , would it ?
