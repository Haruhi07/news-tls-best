The scientists said the ` ` most likely flow rate of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">today</TIMEX3> '' ranges from 35,000 to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million and 2.52 million gallons\/5 .57 million and 9.54 million liters -RRB- per day .
That is a significant jump from the last estimate issued by the Flow Rate Technical Group on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-10">June 10</TIMEX3> and pegging the well 's flow at 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day .
And those figures were considerably higher than the previous ` ` best estimate '' of 12,000 - 19 , 000 bpd issued by the flow rate group on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-27">May 27</TIMEX3> .
` ` This estimate brings together several scientific methodologies and the latest information from the sea floor , and represents a significant step forward in our effort to put a number on the oil that is escaping from BP 's well , '' said Energy Secretary Steven Chu .
The team of scientists said they may revise the estimates again as they gather new data on the well , one mile beneath the ocean surface .
Even at the minimum estimated rate of 35,000 bpd , the ruptured well has dumped nearly 2 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> -- nearly eight times the amount that the Exxon Valdez spilled into Prince William Sound in Alaska in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
At the U.S. government 's direction , BP is boosting its oil capturing capacity to up to 53,000 bpd by <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06" mod="END">the end of June</TIMEX3> and to 80,000 bpd by mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-07">July</TIMEX3> from about 18,000 bpd .
The new estimates come from detailed pressure data taken by instruments inside BP 's oil - containment device on the sea floor <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last 24 hours</TIMEX3> , the government said .
` ` This estimate , which we will continue to refine as the scientific teams get new data and conduct new analyses , is the most comprehensive estimate so far of how much oil is flowing one mile below the ocean 's surface , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a statement .
