WILMINGTON , Delaware | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-10-10">Oct 10 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-10-10T11:42">11:42 am</TIMEX3> EDT WILMINGTON , Delaware -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Four attorneys from Texas , Louisiana and Florida were appointed on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-10-08">Friday</TIMEX3> to a committee to lead the hundreds of oil spill - related lawsuits against BP Plc and its partners , according to court documents .
The committee will coordinate the activities of the 15 - member plaintiffs ' steering committee that was also appointed on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-10-08">Friday</TIMEX3> by Judge Carl Barbier .
Hundreds of lawsuits have been brought by fishermen , restaurant owners , hotels and injured workers stemming from the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which set off the biggest oil spill in U.S. history .
A federal judicial panel sent most of the spill - related lawsuits from around the country to Barbier , a federal judge based in New Orleans .
The executive panel is made up of Jim Roy and Steve Herman , Louisiana lawyers who had already have been acting as the plaintiffs ' co - liaison counsel , which can be a largely administrative role coordinating with the court .
Joining them will be Texas attorney Scott Summy of the Baron and Budd law firm based in Dallas and Brian Barr of Levin Papantonio
Thomas Mitchell Rafferty & Proctor , which is based in Pensacola , Florida .
The 15 - member steering committee includes Elizabeth Cabraser , a California attorney who led the fight against Exxon over the company 's Valdez spill in Alaska .
She is also playing a lead role in lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp over claims its cars raced out of control .
The committee also includes Mike Espy , the Agriculture Secretary for former U.S. President Bill Clinton .
Espy is <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a Mississippi lawyer .

A seat on the committee gives the lawyer the power to shape the direction of the case as well as command a larger slice of the settlement .
Attorneys left off the committee essentially lose control of the lawsuits they have filed against BP and others .
More than 100 attorneys applied for the steering committee , and several notable applicants were excluded .
David Boies , who represented Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case that decided the disputed <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2000">2000</TIMEX3> presidential election , was not appointed .
Nor were heavyweights among plaintiffs attorneys such as Mark Lanier , a Texas attorney , or Joseph Rice of the Motley Rice law firm in South Carolina .
The steering committee also excluded a group of mostly Texas attorneys who dubbed themselves the ` ` Deepwater Horizon Casualty Coalition '' that represented most of the workers who were injured or killed in the rig explosion .
The coalition clashed with other plaintiffs ' attorneys by pushing for an aggressive schedule that included trials on key issues in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-03">March</TIMEX3> .
The judge eventually set <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2012-02">February 2012</TIMEX3> for trying the main issues in the consolidated lawsuits , including how to parse blame for the spill among BP and its partners in the well .
The case in U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Louisiana is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig ` ` Deepwater Horizon '' in the Gulf of Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20 , 2010</TIMEX3> , No . 10 - MDL-2179 .
