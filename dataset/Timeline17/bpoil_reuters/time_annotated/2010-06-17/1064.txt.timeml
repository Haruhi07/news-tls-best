BP CEO Tony Hayward testifies about the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico at the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">June 17 , 2010</TIMEX3> .
WASHINGTON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Jun 17 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-06-17T17:45">5:45 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Lawmakers accused BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward of evasion and ducking responsibility for the worst oil spill in U.S. history when he appeared before them on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> to answer charges his company cut corners on its blown - out Gulf of Mexico well .
In his first appearance before Congress since the start of the 59 - day - old crisis , a tired - looking Hayward sat alone at the witness table as lawmakers took turns during <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT3H" mod="MORE_THAN">more than three hours</TIMEX3> of questioning to lambaste the British energy giant .
` ` Under your leadership BP has taken the most extreme risks , '' Democratic lawmaker Henry Waxman told Hayward , who sat impassively during the lawmakers ' barrage .
` ` BP cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">a few hours</TIMEX3> or days there , '' Waxman said , his comments reflecting public anger over BP 's handling of the crisis .
Hayward , a 53 - year - old geologist with a reputation for blunt speaking , kept largely to a well - rehearsed brief and repeatedly declined to go into detail pending the results of investigations into the spill .
He said it was too early to conclude the company had cut corners .
Waxman snapped back , saying , ` ` You are not taking responsibility .
You are kicking the can down the road . ''
Several lawmakers grew visibly annoyed by Hayward 's answers , accusing him of evasion and telling him they were less interested in his expressions of regret and more concerned about finding out what had gone wrong .
The Briton said he had seen no evidence of reckless behavior and repeatedly said he was not involved in the decision - making about the methods used to dig the well .
` ` I am not stonewalling , '' Hayward said at one point .
Hayward 's careful replies may have been a reflection of the fact that company still faces a criminal investigation and lawsuits that could lead to it paying out billions of dollars .
Investors welcomed the deal BP reached with the White House on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> setting up a $ 20 - billion fund for compensation claims arising from the spill .
It gave them a clearer picture for the first time of the potential costs facing BP .
But equity analysts and credit ratings agency Standard & Poor 's downgraded BP on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> , citing growing liabilities and the White House deal as a competitive disadvantage .
BP might try to sell $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in bonds <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">next week</TIMEX3> -- not because it needs the money but to boost investors ' confidence by showing it can pull off a big deal even amid the political storm , CNBC reported .
BP declined to comment on the report .
Hayward 's opening statement to the hearing , in which he said he was ` ` deeply sorry '' for the spill , was interrupted by a protester with her hands painted black and who yelled , ` ` You need to be charged with a crime , Tony .
You need to go to jail . ''
She was hustled out of the chamber by police .
Hayward told lawmakers BP was doing everything possible to contain the spill .
It was triggered by an explosion on an offshore rig on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> that killed 11 workers and ruptured its well , unleashing a torrent of crude into the Gulf .
The Obama administration 's point man for the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , told reporters BP was ahead of schedule in drilling a relief well to permanently cap the blown - out well .
But he said he could not guarantee it would be finished before its scheduled completion date in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The spill has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , threatened multibillion dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , dolphins and other sea life .
Lawmakers have said BP ignored warnings from contractors and their own employees and chose faster and cheaper drilling options that increased the danger of the well rupturing .
Executives from other major oil companies distanced themselves from BP at an earlier congressional hearing <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">this week</TIMEX3> , saying BP had failed to adhere to industry standards in the construction of its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico .
Under harsh questioning from lawmakers on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> , Hayward urged them to await the outcome of an investigation into the spill and defended his <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DURATION" value="P3Y">three years</TIMEX3> as CEO .
He said he had made dramatic safety improvements but conceded more could be done .
As he spoke , a live video feed on BP 's website showed black crude continuing to gush into the Gulf from under a containment cap that has been placed on top of the leak to try to siphon off the oil and channel to a ship on the surface above .
Environmentalists worried that the political theater playing out on Capitol Hill was taking the focus off the disaster confronting Gulf Coast communities .
` ` This oil is already into the wetlands and more is coming up <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> .
You can not clean it out of there .
The impact of the spill are going to be felt for decades , '' John Hocevar , a marine biologist with Greenpeace , told Reuters in Louisiana .
During <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> 's hearing , Republican congressman Joe Barton of Texas , the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , stunned fellow lawmakers when he apologized to Hayward for the $ 20 billion escrow account the White House pressured the company to agree to .
` ` I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion , that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . ''
Hours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as ` ` outrageous '' and Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them .
In London , the company 's stock closed up nearly 7 percent , catching up with gains notched in the U.S.-listed shares on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after BP 's deal with the Obama administration gave investors enough clarity on liabilities to offset disappointment about a suspended dividend .
The stock lost some of those gains in New York trading , dropping about 1 percent as lawmakers questioned Hayward .
` ` Investors need to think of it as a speculative investment at this point , '' Brian Youngberg , energy analyst at investment firm Edward Jones said of BP 's shares .
` ` You 're getting no income , and you 're hoping things go better . ''
Financial analysts BofA Merrill Lynch and Seymour Pierce downgraded BP from their top ratings following the announcement about the escrow account .
While Hayward was testifying in Washington , BP continued to siphon off oil from its ruptured well in the Gulf .
BP is boosting its oil - containment effort after activating a new oil - burning system on <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
Siphoning capacity will hit 28,000 barrels per day ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-W25" mod="START">early next week</TIMEX3> , '' versus the 18,600 barrels that BP trapped on <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , Allen said .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
This will not fix everything BP has screwed up or the devastation this has caused and will continue to cause for years to come .
They should have been fined a billion dollars <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> from day 1 ! ! ! ! !
Paragraph 3 , ` ` little people '' !
Sell BP and see how soon Mr. Svanberg becomes ` ` small '' !
Coming from goverment , that is a shocker !
Of course they will need more !
I am certain there will be claims of ` ` emotional damage '' from people who saw oil on a beach .
Does anyone want to bet we will see claims from people who do not even live within 5000 miles of the gulf of Mexico ?
