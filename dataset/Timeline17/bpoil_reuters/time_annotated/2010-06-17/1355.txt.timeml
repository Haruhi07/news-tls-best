WASHINGTON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Jun 17 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-06-17T17:18">5:18 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - A Republican U.S. representative apologized to BP CEO Tony Hayward on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> , saying BP was victim of a White House ` ` shakedown '' by having to set up a $ 20 billion Gulf oil spill fund , a comment that angered both Democrats and Republicans .
Joe Barton of Texas , a major recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions , received such ridicule for his unusual apology to the oil giant that he later retracted his statement .
At the start of a congressional hearing featuring testimony from Hayward , Barton said it was ` ` a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown , a $ 20 billion shakedown . ''
` ` I ' m speaking totally for myself , I ' m not speaking for the Republican Party ...
but I ' m ashamed of what happened in the White House <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">yesterday</TIMEX3> , '' Barton told Hayward .
Hours later , Barton retracted his statement , after Vice President Joe Biden condemned the comments as ` ` outrageous '' and the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives issued a joint statement denouncing them .
` ` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' with regard to <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">yesterday</TIMEX3> 's actions at the White House in my opening statement <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="TIME" value="2010-06-17TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> , and I retract my apology to BP , '' Barton said .
He added : ` ` I regret the impact that my statement <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2010-06-17TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident . ''
Barton 's statement had put his own Republicans on the defensive and gave hope to Democrats searching for any way to fend off expected losses to Republicans in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-11-02">November 2</TIMEX3> congressional elections .
At the White House , President Barack Obama shook his head in response and said , ` ` I do n't know why anyone would say that , '' said spokesman Robert Gibbs .
Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> pressured BP to set up the compensation fund for the Gulf spill during a meeting at the White House .
` ` I find it incredibly insensitive , incredibly out of touch , '' Biden told reporters .
` ` There 's no shakedown .
It 's insisting on responsible conduct and a responsible response to something they caused . ''
Barton 's position was politically perilous because Americans largely blame BP for the devastating spill and want the huge company to pay for it .
His stance was bound to be unpopular in the Gulf region , where the spill is wreaking havoc on the economy -- fishermen are out of work and hotel and restaurants are struggling in an area heavily dependent on tourism .
Republican House leaders John Boehner , Eric Cantor and Mike Pence disassociated themselves from Barton .
` ` Congressman Barton 's statements <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="TIME" value="2010-06-17TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> were wrong .
BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion dollars for that purpose , '' they said .
Even Hayward disagreed with Barton 's description of the escrow account as a ` ` slush fund . ''
` ` I certainly do n't think it was a slush fund , '' he told the hearing .
The White House 's Gibbs said Republicans should ask themselves whether Barton should be their party 's leading representative on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce .
There was some talk of Barton losing his position .
But Barton was not alone among Republicans who question the $ 20 billion fund .
Georgia Representative Tom Price , chairman of the Republican Study Committee , a group of conservative House members , issued a statement arguing the same point .
Price said BP 's willingness to go along with the White House 's new fund suggests that the Obama administration is ` ` hard at work exerting its brand of Chicago - style shakedown politics . ''
And former Texas Republican Representative Dick Armey , who was House majority leader and is a leading voice in the conservative Tea Party movement , told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-W24">this week</TIMEX3> that Obama lacks the constitutional authority to set up such a fund .
In addition , conservative Republican Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota told the Heritage Foundation think tank that the escrow account was a ` ` redistribution - of - wealth fund . ''
Barton is the biggest recipient of oil and gas industry campaign contributions in the House of Representatives , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Its data showed that Barton has collected $ 1,447,880 from political action committees and individuals connected with the oil and gas industry since <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
