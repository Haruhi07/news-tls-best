Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc Chief Executive Tony Hayward said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was preventable .
` ` I believe that all accidents are preventable , '' Hayward told a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in response to a question from a lawmaker .
We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
All accidents stem from management breakdown .
What I would like to know is whether the compensation package Hayward received included a portion of his bonus that depended on BP 's safety record .
That would be a clear signal from the Board that establishment of a ` ` safety culture '' at BP was important .
Hayward did testify that he made a lot of changes in how the company operated once he took over .
BP has been responsible for half of the major leaks before this one .
They did n't follow procedure , nor did they use safety precautions as those would hinder the speed and cost of drilling .
BP also made a worst case scenario clean up promise to get the permit , which was 4 times the amount spilling <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and yet can not contain it .
Sounds like willful negligence , not safety concerns and certainly not a desire to have a safety culture .
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
