WASHINGTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-26T24:13">12:13 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc told congressional investigators on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-25">Tuesday</TIMEX3> that pressure tests on a drill pipe showed a fundamental mistake hours before the deadly explosion that caused the Gulf of Mexico oil leak , a memo released by two congressmen showed .
The memo by Representatives Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak , who were briefed by BP about the progress of its internal investigation , also said problems were found in equipment meant to provide fail - safe protection against a blow out .
A BP investigator indicated to the lawmakers that the fundamental mistake may have been made because heavy pressure on the drill line of 1,400 pounds per square inch -LRB- 98 kg per square cm -RRB- was an ` ` indicator of a very large abnormality . ''
The memo did not indicate who made decisions after the problem was found .
BP and Transocean , the owner and operator of the rig , had supervisors on the rig when it exploded .
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT2H" mod="APPROX">About two hours</TIMEX3> before the explosion that killed 11 workers and caused the leak that is still gushing oil , the rig team was satisfied a test on another line was successful , the BP investigator said .
BP would not comment on the memo .
A Transocean spokesman blamed BP for the disaster , saying , ` ` A well is constructed and completed the same way a house is built -- at the direction of the owner and the architect .
And in this case , that 's BP . ''
The congressional memo said BP data showed there were numerous problems with production equipment .
<TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT5H" mod="LESS_THAN">Nearly five hours</TIMEX3> before the explosion , an unexpected loss of fluid was observed in the well 's riser pipe .
That suggests ` ` there were leaks in the annual preventer , '' a rubber gasket in the blowout preventer , the memo said .
Waxman and Stupak chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's investigative subcommittee , which has reviewed over 105,000 pages of internal documents from BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd , Halliburton Co , and blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron .
The memo said the BP investigation has also raised concerns about the maintenance history , modification , and inspection of the blowout preventer .
Officials from BP and Transocean are scheduled to testify before congressional panels on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-05-20">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
According to BP , there also were three warning signs of problems with unwanted flow in the well starting <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PT51M">51 minutes</TIMEX3> before the explosion .
<TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="PT18M" mod="APPROX">About 18 minutes</TIMEX3> before the explosion abnormal pressure leaks of the fluids known as mud meant to keep oil and gas capped were observed and the pump was shut down .
` ` The data suggests that the crew may have attempted mechanical interventions at that point to control the pressure , but soon after , the flow out and pressure increased dramatically and the explosion took place , '' the memo said .

It was 13,000 at the bottom of the well .
Again , where was it measured ?
What 's a ` ` drill line ? ''
