HOUSTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">May 26 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-26T19:46">7:46 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc said an ambitious deep - sea operation to choke off a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was proceeding as planned on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-26">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , while President Barack Obama cautioned Americans there was no guarantee it would work .
BP is under intense pressure from Obama to bring a swift end to the five - week - old leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe and a blow to Obama 's crisis - manager image .
Undersea robots were helping to inject heavy fluids and ultimately cement pumped down about a mile to the sea - bed well , while BP chief executive Tony Hayward and U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu monitored operations together in Houston .
` ` The operation is proceeding as we planned it , '' Hayward said in a media briefing <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> after launching the ` ` top kill '' strategy to stanch the leak .
` ` It will be another <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1D">24 hours</TIMEX3> before we know whether or not this has been successful , '' he added .
The embattled CEO stood by BP 's 60 - 70 percent odds of success .
But top kill , a routine procedure on the surface , has never been attempted at such depths , prompting one industry expert to put the odds of success at less than 50 percent .
` ` You have got some of the smartest guys in the business trying to figure this out , but it has never been done before , '' David Pursell , partner at Houston investment bank Tudor , Pickering , Holt & Co , told Reuters Insider .
` ` I think the odds have to be 50 percent or less , '' he added .
Obama said that if successful , BP 's plan to cap the well should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of hundreds of thousands of gallons -LRB- liters
-RRB- of crude billowing into the Gulf .
If it fails , ` ` there are other approaches that may be viable , '' he said on a trip to California .
Obama , who has told aides to ` ` plug the damn hole , '' will head to Louisiana on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-05-28">Friday</TIMEX3> for the second time since the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> rig blast that killed 11 and unleashed the oil .
BP says the next approach would be to install a containment device over the broken blowout preventer , a structure at the top of the well on the ocean floor , to try to stop the oil flow .
It would attempt this in the next <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P3D">three</TIMEX3> or <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> .
It is still unclear how much oil is flowing from the well , but it is already shaping up to be the worst oil spill in U.S. history and a long - term threat to a rich ecosystem .
The oil 's destruction of critical habitats continued to spread , with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal saying that more than 100 miles of the state 's 400 - mile coastline were <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> affected .
A BP statement said the top kill action began at <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="TIME" value="2010-04-20T13:00">1 p.m.</TIMEX3> CST after the U.S. Coast Guard approved the operation , the most ambitious effort to date to cap the well .
PIVOTAL DAYS FOR OBAMA , BP These days may be critical for the London - based energy giant and Obama .
BP 's reputation and its big presence in the United States is at stake and investors , who have wiped $ 50 billion off BP 's market value since the start of the spill , will watch closely to see whether the latest attempt to seal the well works .
BP shares seesawed in London trading , with investors boosting the share price about 2.6 percent at one point before it closed up 1.4 percent .
BP 's announcement that it had launched the new operation came after London markets had closed .
If the effort fails , Obama may have no choice but to take charge of the response .
He has so far deflected calls for the government to take a more direct role and said BP has legal responsibility for fixing the mess .
What he can do is unclear because the government does not have its own deepwater tools and technology and will have to rely on BP .
But even with Obama applying constant pressure on the company , polls show that nearly half of Americans are unhappy with how he has handled it .
That sentiment could play into the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> elections that are widely expected to erode his Democratic Party 's control of the U.S. Congress .
Florida Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said if BP failed to plug the leak <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-W21">this week</TIMEX3> , Obama must seize personal control of the effort immediately .
` ` If this thing does n't work then the president ought to turn this over to the military .
It has the command structure to bring in all the civilian agencies , '' said Nelson .
Residents of the Gulf region are particularly concerned about the impact of spreading oil on wildlife and area shorelines , home to a lucrative fishing and tourism business .
Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the worst affected Louisiana coastal districts so far , sharply criticized BP executives and Coast Guard leaders , saying they had no comprehensive plan to defend the coast from the oil .
` ` We will lose more coastline from this catastrophe than from all four hurricanes -- Katrina , Rita , Gustav and Ike , '' said Nungesser .
Commercial fishing , shrimping and oyster harvests have been shut down for weeks along much of the Gulf coast , home to a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry .
BP said it had appointed an independent mediator to oversee damage claims .
More than 26,000 claims have been submitted so far , resulting in payments of more than $ 36 million .
BP has estimated that about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\/795 , 000 liters -RRB- have been leaking <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> , although some scientists have given much higher numbers for the size of the leak -- up to 20 times more .
The head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Jane Lubchenco , told a congressional hearing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would provide a new estimate within <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> on the amount of oil leaking from the well .
` ` It 's only been in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last couple of days</TIMEX3> that we have gotten video that was high enough resolution , long enough length and fast enough shutter speed to really do credible calculations , '' Lubchenco said .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

Yet , nobody actually says what he should do .
What we 're seeing in the Gulf , is exactly what the GOP , Conservatives , Libertarians , etc , have been whining for , for decades -- - sparse Federal regulation , with Corporations monitoring themselves .
Just like the financial meltdown , we 're seeing the result of that ideology .
Yet , <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> they 're whining for Obama to do more -- - for more Federal intervention .
The hypocrisy , kind of makes one 's mind explode .
And sadly , due to the Corporate influence of the Federal Government , the Government is n't prepared to do anything .
They do n't even have submersibles capable of working at that depth .
Maybe Obama can dive down there himself , and pump all the GOP hot - air into the well , to equalize the pressure ...
Several people need to go to jail for this but sadly no one will .
