The Q4000 multi - purpose oil field intervention vessel -LRB- L -RRB- and the drillship the Discoverer Explorer -LRB- C -RRB- burn off material from the Deepwater Horizon wellhead near the disaster site <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-06-24">June 24 , 2010</TIMEX3> .
The oil spill , which began on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , has caused an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , threatening fisheries , tourism and wildlife .
Tropical depression Alex moved into the southwestern gulf , prompting the closure of two key Mexican oil ports , and was likely on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">Monday</TIMEX3> to regain tropical storm status , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said .
Forecasters expect Alex to make landfall again as a hurricane early on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-06-24">Thursday</TIMEX3> between Brownsville , Texas , and Tuxpan de Rodriguez Cano in Mexico , sparing BP 's oil collection efforts in the Gulf .

The British newspaper the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> Times reported that BP 's drilling of relief wells , intended to plug its leaking deep - sea well , is going more quickly than expected and the company could stop the flow of oil in mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-07">July</TIMEX3> .
That would be <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06-13" mod="APPROX">about two weeks earlier</TIMEX3> than BP 's <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> public projection of <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-08" mod="START">early August</TIMEX3> .
The newspaper cited sources with knowledge of the operation .
A BP spokesperson declined to comment on the report and referred to a company statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-25">Friday</TIMEX3> that the two relief wells -- begun on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-05-02">May 2</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">May 16</TIMEX3> -- were estimated to take <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="APPROX">approximately three months</TIMEX3> to finish .
Louisiana 's fragile wetlands have been hardest hit by the oil but Mississippi had escaped damage until <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-06-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> , although some oil had tainted its barrier islands .
Oil has also come ashore in Alabama and Florida 's Gulf coast .
Oil from the spill hit two tourist beaches at Ocean Springs , about 10 miles east of Biloxi , Mississippi , and a beach used by fishermen close to an inland marsh .
Mississippi state officials and the U.S. Coast Guard , who said they expect more oil to arrive , were waiting on BP contractors to start cleaning up .
` ` We can not clean up or catch the oil until BP gets here .
They have all of our people , '' said Earl Etheridge , a spokesman for Mississippi 's Department of Environmental Quality .
Alex , the first named storm of the <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> Atlantic hurricane season , had sustained winds of 35 mph and was about 55 miles south - southwest of Campeche .
The system was moving west - northwest at 9 mph .
Even if it misses the spill area , large waves could hamper clean - up efforts from Louisiana to Florida from the spill .
Shell Oil Co evacuated nonessential workers from production platforms and drilling rigs in U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf oil fields on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-06-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> , anticipating Alex 's impact , and on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-06-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> shut subsea production at two platforms .
Meteorologists predict a very active Atlantic hurricane season , which runs from <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-06-01">June 1</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-11-30">November 30</TIMEX3> .
The U.S. government estimates that up to 60,000 barrels of oil -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- per day are spewing from BP 's damaged well on the seabed about a mile below the surface .
While awaiting the completion of the relief wells to finally plug the leak , BP has been using two oil collection systems to prevent some of the oil from its ruptured well from spewing into the sea .
BP said on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-06-27">Sunday</TIMEX3> its crews had collected or burned off 22,750 barrels of oil on <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-06-26">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Equipment going to the leak site <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">this week</TIMEX3> could raise daily collection to 53,000 barrels , officials say , and a review is scheduled of a system that may boost it to 80,000 barrels .
The oil spill was a topic at <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P1WE">a weekend</TIMEX3> meeting in Canada of leaders of the Group of 20 world 's biggest economies .
G20 sources said the summit communique included a reference to the spill and urged the sharing of best practices to protect marine life , prevent accidents and deal with the consequences when accidents occur .
Shares of BP have been savaged since the crisis started and fell another 6 percent to a 14 - year low on <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2010-06-25">Friday</TIMEX3> .
The costs to BP include but are not limited to a $ 20 billion compensation fund it set up under U.S. pressure .
BP said it has paid out $ 2.35 billion so far in clean - up and compensation costs .

Going to any beach with oil on it is like chewing razor blades !
The oil is loaded with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons -LRB- PAHs -RRB- .
The introduction of chemical dispersants increases the amount of carcinogens in the oil .
The federal government should be passing out Material Safety Data Sheets -LRB- MSDS -RRB- .
They are designed to provide both workers and emergency personnel or people on the beach picking up or walking on tar balls with the proper procedures for handling hazardous material .
The oil is a toxic material .
Some people who have breathed or touched mixtures of PAHs and other chemicals for long periods of time have developed cancer .
Some PAHs have caused cancer in laboratory animals when they breathed air containing them -LRB- lung cancer -RRB- , ingested them in food -LRB- stomach cancer -RRB- , or had them applied to their skin -LRB- skin cancer -RRB- .
We know this from an oil spill <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DATE" value="2002">eight years ago</TIMEX3> in Buzzards Bay , Massachusetts .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2003-04-27">April 27 , 2003</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2002">eight years ago</TIMEX3> the Bouchard Barge B-120 hit an obstacle in Buzzards Bay , creating a 12 - foot rupture in its hull and discharging an estimated 100,000 gallons of No . 6 oil .
The oil is known to have affected an estimated 90 miles of shoreline , numerous bird species , and recreational use of the bay , such as shell fishing and boating .
Why are all the efforts aimed at collecting oil from the well instead of just sealing it ?
Additionally , the public has been told for weeks that ` ` all that can be done is being done , '' if that is the case , how are the efforts <TIMEX3 tid="t48" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being ramped up ?
Does n't that imply they were not actually doing all they could to stop or contain the oil ?
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
