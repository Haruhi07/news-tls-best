LONDON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-10-07">Oct 7 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-10-07T07:41">7:41 am</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - U.S. oil explorers are talking about forming a new insurance fund that would cover the costs of any future oil spill , to avoid a scenario where smaller companies are unable to drill offshore , a senior industry executive said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-10-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
BP 's oil spill is expected to rack up an over $ 30 billion bill for shutting the leak , cleaning up the oil and compensating those affected .
This has prompted concerns about what would have happened if a company without BP 's massive resources had been operating the blown - out well .
Jim Farnsworth , Chief Executive of Cobalt International , a small explorer focused on the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico , said his company was in talks on a solution to avert such fears .
` ` It is likely and probably desirable for a combination of us to come together and insure against these types of accidents , '' he told the Finding Petroleum conference in London .
` ` Cobalt is actively in discussions along those lines , '' he added .
Some analysts have predicted that the oil spill could cause a shakeout with smaller companies being forced to sell up because new regulations force them to seek insurance cover which may be either unobtainable or unaffordable .
In the wake of Exxon 's Valdez oil spill , companies formed a $ 1 billion fund to pay for future oil spills .
Farnsworth , a former BP executive , said he expected the new fund to be bigger .
Cobalt 's market capitalization has dropped by $ 1.5 billion , or 30 percent , since the oil spill began , Farnsworth said .
The CEO added that he expected it would take a long time for drilling to resume in the Gulf of Mexico even if a drilling moratorium , installed in the wake of the oil spill , is lifted in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-11">November</TIMEX3> , as expected .
` ` The real moratorium ends when they start issuing permits again and that could take a long time , '' he said .
Some analysts predict permitting may remain paralyzed until <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2011" mod="END">late 2011</TIMEX3> .

In very simple term , the proposition of building up new Insurance Fund is definitely a good and welcoming step for any exigencies that may arise during the operation of drilling .
It must be ensured that the in the process of doing it small oil companies are not put out of business .
The smaller oil companies if need be may raise insurance fund within its capacity without winding up the business .
If required merge with as many small companies as possible to form a bigger oil company .
