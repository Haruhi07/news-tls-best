HOUSTON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Jul 1 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-07-01T19:46">7:46 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Tropical storm Alex slowed oil spill clean - up and containment work in the Gulf of Mexico and drove more petroleum into fragile Gulf wetlands and beaches on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> , with any permanent fix to BP Plc 's ruptured deep - sea well still <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="PXW">several weeks</TIMEX3> away .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10W" mod="MORE_THAN">More than 10 weeks</TIMEX3> into the crisis , oil continued spewing into the Gulf , clean - up success remained limited and a proposal by the Obama administration to halt all deep - water drilling for <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the next six months</TIMEX3> remained in limbo .
Washington 's attention has also been distracted by the <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> firing of U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan and the fate of a huge financial reform bill .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">This week</TIMEX3> nature added to the problems as Alex crossed the Gulf .
The storm made landfall as a hurricane over northeastern Mexico well to the west of the spill site , but its high winds and rough seas thwarted plans by BP to expand the volume of oil it is siphoning from the well .
The bad weather also pushed more oil - polluted water onto the shoreline of the U.S. Gulf Coast and forced the halt of skimming , spraying of dispersant chemicals and controlled burns of oil on the ocean surface .
` ` It has brought in oil , unfortunately , from the panhandle of Florida to Louisiana , <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , at a higher rate than it has been <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">over the last few days</TIMEX3> , '' Robert Dudley , chief of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration efforts , said of the storm 's effect in a live PBS online interview .
He said the storm had spawned waves of 8 to 12 feet in some parts of the Gulf .
The worst oil spill in U.S. history , entering its 73rd day on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> , has unleashed an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions along the Gulf Coast , idling much of the region 's fishing and tourism industries , soiling its beaches and marshlands and killing wildlife .
Millions of barrels of crude oil have gushed nonstop from the floor of the Gulf , about 50 miles off Louisiana , since an <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion that demolished the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and killed 11 crewmen .
BP says the target date for two relief wells to intercept and plug the blown - out well remains early to mid - <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010-08">August</TIMEX3> .
The British energy giant drew harsh criticism earlier in the crisis , but some of the political heat has cooled since President Barack Obama pressured the company to set up a $ 20 billion fund for damages and lawmakers hammered BP executives at congressional hearings .
In Washington on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to give families of those killed in the oil rig explosion greater latitude to sue for damages .
And the House Transportation Committee met to negotiate proposed legislation to hold vessels and facilities more accountable for oil spills .
The White House , meanwhile , said it expected to release details of a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> .
A federal court order <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">last week</TIMEX3> blocked the government 's initial ban on drilling exploratory and development wells in waters more than 500 feet deep , and a revised plan could still face legal challenges .
In an interview with Reuters , International Energy Agency head Nobuo Tanaka said a moratorium ` ` makes sense '' while a presidential commission investigates the spill 's cause .
But he said the world still relied on oil and gas , and that rigs idled in the Gulf should leave to search for resources elsewhere .
BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began .
But shares have shown signs of stabilizing .
They closed nearly 2 percent higher in New York on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> , after ending the day up almost 3 percent in London .
Pacific Investment Management Co. -LRB-
PIMCO -RRB- , which manages the world 's biggest bond fund , said on <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> it is buying more debt of some of the companies involved in the oil spill disaster , though it did not cite specific corporations .
Separately , Mark Kiesel , head of the PIMCO corporate bond portfolio management group , wrote in an article that BP had hefty amounts of cash on hand , strong operating cash flow and could sell assets to raise money if needed .
In the Gulf of Mexico , seas were still too rough on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> to allow skimming to resume , and Coast Guard officials said they doubted it would be calm enough on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-07-02">Friday</TIMEX3> , either .
` ` The weather <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">today</TIMEX3> , unfortunately , looks much the same as <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-06-30">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
Operations will likely be curtailed , '' Coast Guard Commander Charles Diorio said on a conference call .
` ` We expect the seas to start to calm down as we get into <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2010-06-25">Friday</TIMEX3> and further into <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-W25-WE">the weekend</TIMEX3> , '' Diorio said .
In bays and estuaries , work crews were replacing boom dislodged or damaged by the storm , but the Coast Guard had no estimate on the extent of damage .
The storm surge from Alex also pushed oil more toward the northwest , in the direction of Mississippi and Louisiana , after <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> in which the slick had crept mainly toward the northeast , washing up on Florida Panhandle beaches .
The weather delayed BP plans to boost containment capacity at the undersea well , but relief well drilling continued .
A government spokeswoman said on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-07-01">Thursday</TIMEX3> a massive ship converted into a ` ` super skimmer '' had arrived in the Gulf to assist with the cleanup .
The 1,100 - foot -LRB- 335 meter -RRB- vessel , dubbed the ` ` A Whale , '' was provided by its owner , TMT Shipping of Taiwan , officials said .
Government officials estimate 35,000 barrels -LRB- 1.47 million gallons\/5 .56 million liters -RRB- to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- of oil pour from the ruptured wellhead <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
BP 's containment systems can handle up to 28,000 barrels daily and its planned addition could raise that to 53,000 .

As we enter one of the most aggressive hurricane seasons on record , I can not even imagine what a hurricane would do with oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
Dealing with oil on the beach is one thing , but what if we had to deal with it in our streets , in our businesses , in our homes ?
What if we had to rescue humans covered in oil ?

What if this is no longer isolated to just the Gulf Coast but found its way up the great rivers to our inner cities ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> imagine if you will , the dispersants mixed with oil which could possibly cause untold diseases and catastrophic health hazards of a biblical proportion .
It staggers the imagination , or is it prophetic ?

What if we are dealing with the wrath of God ?
