S. Coast Guard\/Petty Officer 3rd Class Patrick Kelley\/Handout ROBERT , Louisiana | Sat <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">May 8 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-05-08T17:29">5:29 pm</TIMEX3> EDT ROBERT ,
Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc suffered a setback on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> in an attempt to contain oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico with a metal box when crystallized gas filled the structure , a blow to hopes of a quick , temporary solution to a growing disaster .
BP engineers have moved the four - story containment dome -- which was seen as the best short - term way to stem the flow from a ruptured oil well -- off to the side on the sea floor and will take <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> trying to come up with a solution , Doug Suttles , chief operating officer , told reporters .
The problem is with gas hydrates , essentially slushy methane gas that would block the oil from being siphoned out the top of the box .
As BP tries to solve it , oil keeps flowing unchecked into the Gulf in what could be the worst U.S. oil spill .
` ` I would n't say it 's failed yet .
What I would say is what we attempted to do <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2010-05-07TNI">last night</TIMEX3> did n't work because these hydrates plugged up the top of the dome , '' Suttles said .
` ` What we 're <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> doing , and I suspect it will probably take <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the next 48 hours or so</TIMEX3> , is saying , ` Is there a way to overcome this problem ? ' ''
The company , under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage to the Gulf and coastlines of four states , expected hydrates , but not the volumes encountered after a crew lowered the dome nearly a mile to the sea floor .
Possible solutions may involve heating the area or adding methanol to break up the hydrates , Suttles said .
Officials had already warned there was no guarantee that the technology would work at such water depth .
BP had spent <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">the previous day</TIMEX3> or so lowering the 98 - ton contraption to the well site with the aid of sensors , video cameras and undersea robots .
It hopes to attach a pipe to the chamber to start pumping oil up to a tanker , with the aim of capturing about 85 percent of the leaking oil .
The spill threatens an economic and ecological disaster targeting beaches , wildlife refuges and fishing grounds in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
It has forced President Barack Obama to rethink plans to open more waters to drilling .
BP suffered another blow on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> when ratings agency Standard & Poor 's lowered its outlook on the British oil giant to negative from stable .
It has said it will pay all legitimate costs , a bill that is likely to run into the billions of dollars .
The company gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> .
Suttles said BP may <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> try to plug up the existing preventer or attach a new one on top of it .
It also is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P3M" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to three months</TIMEX3> to complete .
In the initial blast , a natural gas cloud enveloped the rig and exploded just as visiting BP officials were celebrating seven accident - free years in the rig 's crew quarters , according to accounts by survivors of the blast .
According to transcripts of interviews obtained by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , a giant methane bubble rushed up the drill pipe and filled the air above the deck of the drilling platform with flammable gas , followed by a scalding flood of crude that spilled onto the drill deck and ignited .
Nine workers on the drill deck were killed , along with two others working in the nearby mud storage room , Bea said .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> of calm weather , winds began to pick up on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> , preventing controlled burns of the thickest concentrations of oil .
Crews conducted five burns on <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Nearly 200 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2010-05-08">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Crews have laid almost 900,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant .
In Bayou La Batre , the heart of Alabama 's seafood industry , the docks were largely quiet as thousands of shrimpers and seafood processors remained idled by fishing restrictions prompted by the oil spill .
About 30 oyster - processing plants have run out of product and shut down , putting as many as 900 people out of work , said Wayne Eldridge , owner of J&W Marine Enterprises and an oyster plant operator himself .
` ` I ' m screwed , '' Eldridge said .
` ` The biggest thing is I ' ve got 35 people unemployed there . ''
BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said a $ 75 million legal cap on the companies ' liabilities for economic damages under federal law , which some U.S. lawmakers <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> want to raise , would not be a limit and renewed promises to meet all ` ` legitimate '' claims .
Standard & Poor 's , in announcing BP 's negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely .
Moody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project .
S&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill - fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is ` ` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean - up . ''
Other companies involved are Transocean , owner of the rig ; Cameron International , which supplied the failed blow - out preventer for the well ; and Halliburton , which helped cement in place the blown - out well .
An estimated 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\/795 , 000 liters -RRB- have poured into the Gulf <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> since the well ruptured .

But Ian MacDonald , a biological oceanographer at Florida State University , said the estimate was much too conservative .
The real flow rate from the undersea well , based on aerial images of the oil slick and estimates of the thickness of the oil itself , is probably closer to 25,000 barrels -LRB- 1.05 million gallons\/4 million liters -RRB- per day , MacDonald told Reuters .
A sheen of oil has engulfed much of the Chandeleur Islands , barrier islands that are part of Louisiana 's Breton National Wildlife Refuge , the first confirmation of the oil slick hitting land .
Some oiled birds have been found in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
BP contractors and commercial fishermen worked feverishly in waist - deep water to anchor booms around tiny uninhabited barrier islands as thousands of birds watched , according to a Reuters photographer .
The Breton refuge was closed to the public after a silver sheen and emulsified oil reached the shoreline , the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said .
Altogether , crude from the spill could hit 24 national wildlife refuges .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Obama was too busy playing stand up comic to even bother with this situation for nearly TWO WEEKS !
Then , instead of sending the world 's best engineers to save our shorelines , he sent LAWYERS to see who could be SUED .
How much money will bring back the coral reefs , the white beaches , the sea ?
Obama is utterly useless .
To the last poster : Where do you get your ` ` facts '' ?
The administration declared it an emergency within a couple days and had already directed coast guard officials and the DOD to act expeditiously in containing the leak .
The answer to your question is Billions , with a a B , it will cost BILLIONS to fix the problem .
This is exactly why we should n't be risking our waters and beaches with offshore oil drilling , instead we should be creating thousands of jobs by implementing off shore wind farm .
Let us all hope and pray that they are successful in placing this dome and that it works .
Do everything we can to help the effort to stop this leak !
