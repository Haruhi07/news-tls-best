WASHINGTON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Jun 16 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2010-06-16T14:59">2:59 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's chairman apologized on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to the American people for the catastrophic oil spill on the Gulf coast .
The company also said it would forgo paying dividends to its shareholders <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> .
Emerging from a meeting with President Barack Obama , BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg promised to look after people affected by the spill and to repair damage to the environment .
` ` We have agreed <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">today</TIMEX3> with the president a framework that should assure the American people that we mean what we say , '' Svanberg told reporters .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Perhaps Obama should also apologize for his administration 's role -LRB- or lack of -RRB- .
BP was always concerned about ` ` bottom - line - profits '' & expediency NOT the health and welfare of their lowly employees nor the ecology of this Earth !
That just hurts more innocent people who have invested in the company and worked for them .
There are 23 thousand USA employees working for BP as well as all the contractors .
I was one of them but cuts and the economy forced me out .
The bottom line is ` ` it sucks '' but its done and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we need to prepare for the next spill .
It will happen again that is for sure .
I also think all the people complaining should stop joy riding in there F150 's or Harleys .
We made these Oil Monsters and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we cry about them .
This discussion is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> closed .
