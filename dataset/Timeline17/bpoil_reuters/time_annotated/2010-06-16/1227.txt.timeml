BP cuts dividend and capex to pay for oil spill LONDON | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Jun 16 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2010-06-16T16:59">4:59 pm</TIMEX3> EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil giant BP said it would not pay three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to fund a planned $ 20 billion fund to pay for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
The commitments , outlined in a statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , are harsher penalties than most investors had expected and follow BP chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg 's meeting with President Obama on <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
BP said it would cancel the previously declared first - quarter dividend scheduled for payment on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">June 21</TIMEX3> , and said no interim dividends will be declared for the second and third quarters of <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
The payouts had been expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent quarters</TIMEX3> .
Investors had expected the suspension of BP 's dividend , or payment in shares for <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="PXQ">a couple of quarters</TIMEX3> , and had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment by 10 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> -- moves that will curb BP 's growth .
When quizzed by analysts on a conference call about what BP had received in return for such major concessions , Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote said the agreement reflected the rising anger toward BP . ''

It -RRB- will certainly allow us to progress our business more effectively than would have otherwise been the case , '' he said .
The decisions to cut investment and sell assets come despite the fact BP is committed to putting only $ 5 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> into the new fund , which will be administered by a body independent from BP .
The company said it would generate over $ 30 billion from operations <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2010">this year</TIMEX3> , while it also has massive credit lines .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2011">2011</TIMEX3> and beyond , BP will make payments into the fund of $ 1.25 billion per quarter , until the fund amounts to $ 20 billion .
Grote said the $ 20 billion was not a cap on BP 's liability , but that he expected it would cover the bulk of claims .
Until $ 20 billion has been added to the fund , BP 's commitments will be assured by the setting aside of U.S. assets with a value of $ 20 billion , the company said .
U.S.-listed BP shares finished 46 cents higher , or 1.5 percent , at $ 31.85 on the New York Stock Exchange .
