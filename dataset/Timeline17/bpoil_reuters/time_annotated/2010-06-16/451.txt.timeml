Reuters -RRB- - Under intense pressure from President Barack Obama , BP Plc agreed on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> to set up a $ 20 billion fund for damage claims from its huge Gulf of Mexico oil spill and suspended dividend payments to its shareholders .
The deal gave Obama his most tangible success since the crisis began <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2010-04-19">58 days ago</TIMEX3> and came after weeks of criticism of his handling of the disaster .
It also eased U.S. pressure on BP , whose share price has withered amid uncertainty over the spill 's cost to the British energy giant .
Obama announced the agreement after White House officials held <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="PT4H">four hours</TIMEX3> of talks with BP executives , who emerged to offer an apology to the American people for the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
` ` I do thank you for the patience that you have during this difficult time , '' BP Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg said .
` ` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies who do n't care .
But that is not the case in BP .
We care about the small people . ''
Svanberg promised to make sure damage claims are handled swiftly and fairly .
Chief Executive Tony Hayward , the public face of BP 's response to the disaster , will appear on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Thursday</TIMEX3> at a congressional hearing where he will face intense scrutiny over events leading up to the spill and BP 's cleanup of the mess .
An <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion on an offshore rig leased by BP killed 11 workers and ruptured a deep - sea well .
The ensuing spill has fouled 120 miles of U.S. coastline , imperiled multibillion - dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds , sea turtles and dolphins .
While Obama stressed the agreement would not cap BP 's total liabilities , Wall Street appeared to cheer the small dose of clarity the deal provided , driving up the company 's share price by 1.5 percent in New York .
Under the agreement , BP committed to pay $ 20 billion into an independently managed fund <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over four years</TIMEX3> , suspend dividend payments for the rest of the year and pay $ 100 million to workers idled by the six - month moratorium on deep - sea drilling that the Obama administration imposed after the spill .
The $ 20 billion figure is roughly equal to BP 's average annual profits <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P4Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past four years</TIMEX3> .
` ` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable , '' Obama said at the White House .
` `
And I ' m absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . ''
The fund will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration official who oversaw compensation for executives at companies that received federal bailout funds .
Obama had pressed BP to set up a fund administered by a third party after hearing first - hand complaints from Gulf Coast residents that BP 's claims process was too complicated and the company was paying out too little money .
With thousands of Gulf Coast commercial fishermen largely idled by the spill , Louisiana shrimper Clifton Bartholomew , 21 , wondered whether $ 20 billion would be enough .
` ` If you add it all up together -- everybody in shrimping , fishing , the whole industry -- by the time this is all gone I think they 'll need more than $ 20 billion , '' Bartholomew said .
BP said in a statement it would cut three quarters of dividends , significantly reduce its investment program and sell $ 10 billion of assets to create the fund .
The commitments are harsher penalties than most investors had hoped for .
They had not expected BP to be forced to sell assets and cut investment -- moves that would curb its growth .
BP said it would cancel the first - quarter dividend due for payment on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-06-21">June 21</TIMEX3> and would not declare interim dividends for the second and third quarters of <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> .
The payouts were expected to be about $ 2.6 billion per quarter , in line with <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent quarters</TIMEX3> .
Obama stressed BP was ` ` a strong and viable company , and it is in all of our interests that it remain so . ''
The oil giant represents a large part of investment portfolios in Britain .
Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron talked about the issues around the spill <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="2010-W23-WE">last weekend</TIMEX3> .
BP 's shares gyrated in volatile New York trading , dropping as much as 5 percent before swinging to positive territory on news of the agreement on the fund , known as an escrow account .
` ` It 's a step in the right direction for BP but unfortunately I can not say the same for Tony Hayward because it is going to get tougher for him , '' said Fadel Gheit , managing director of oil and gas research at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co in New York ` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2010-06-17">Tomorrow</TIMEX3> he 's going to be in the hot seat under glaring lights and tremendous animosity and criticism '' at the hearing .
The BP chief executive will tell lawmakers the entire oil and natural gas industry needs to be better prepared for deepwater accidents , according to his prepared testimony .
That is an apparent response to attempts by rival oil companies to distance themselves from BP 's disaster at a hearing on <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2010-06-15">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
As BP stock saw some relief , shares in Anadarko fell 3.69 percent and Transocean lost 3.09 percent in New York .
Anadarko is part owner of the blown - out well and Transocean owned the rig that blew up .
Back in the Gulf , BP said it started a second system to siphon oil from the leak on <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="2010-06-16">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> after a team of U.S. scientists raised their high - end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 percent to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day .
