HOUSTON\/GALLIANO , Louisiana | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">May 16 , 2010</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2010-05-16T19:59">7:59 pm</TIMEX3> EDT HOUSTON\/GALLIANO , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP marked a limited success at containing the oil that is gushing unabated into the Gulf of Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> and said it may be able to stop the flow permanently in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="APPROX">about a week</TIMEX3> .
But reports of huge oil plumes in the Gulf -- including one as large as 10 miles long , three miles wide and 300 feet thick -- underscored the spill 's environmental impact as the crisis moved into its 24th day .
Crude oil has been gushing unchecked from a ruptured well about a mile under the ocean 's surface , threatening an ecological and economic calamity along the U.S. Gulf Coast .
After other attempts to contain the spill failed , BP Plc succeeded in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas .
The underwater operation used guided robots to insert a small tube into a 21 - inch -LRB- 53 - cm -RRB- pipe , known as a riser , to funnel the oil to a ship at the surface .
` ` It 's working as planned and we are very slowly increasing the rate that is coming from the riser tool up to the surface , '' BP senior executive vice president Kent Wells told reporters at BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston .
` ` So we do have oil and gas coming to the ship <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> . ''
Not all of the oil was being trapped , however .
Wells said it was too early to say how much had been siphoned .
` ` This is a good step forward , '' said Satish Nagarajaiah , professor in civil and mechanical engineering at Rice University in Houston , but he said the siphon tool is unlikely to capture more than 15 - 20 percent of the oil .
The Obama administration downplayed the significance of BP 's latest breakthrough .
` ` This technique is not a solution to the problem , and it is not yet clear how successful it may be , '' Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said in a joint statement .
Preparations for a maneuver to inject mud into the well to stop the leak for good were ongoing and would be completed in seven to <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P10D">10 days</TIMEX3> , Wells said .
Undersea robots are preparing pipes and hoses around the well to pump up to 40 barrels -LRB- 1,680 gallons -RRB- per minute of mud into the well .
BP 's best near - term hope of stopping oil from pouring from the well is ` ` kill mud , '' a heavy mixture of synthetic materials that technicians will attempt to shoot into the well to form a barrier to prevent oil and gas from escaping .
` ` Ultimately it is a winning game that we outpump the well , '' Wells said .
If the mud fails to seal the well , BP will attempt to inject golf balls , tire fragments and other materials into the well to clog it up , known in the industry as a ` ` junk shot . ''
The success on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">Sunday</TIMEX3> followed a previous setback , when a cord taking the oil to the surface became entangled .
BP 's earlier attempts to contain the leaking well have been stymied by the technical difficulties of working in the sea floor 's cold , dark conditions .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2010-05-07">May 7</TIMEX3> , BP tried to lower a containment dome over the leak , but the 100 - tonne device was rendered useless by a slush of frozen hydrocarbons that clogged it .
The spill began after an <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers .
It threatens to eclipse the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska as the worst U.S. ecological disaster .
POTENTIAL RISK TO THE EAST , FLORIDA KEYS So far , winds have pushed the giant slick westward and toward shore .
But according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the southern edge of the spill could make its way into a powerful ocean <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> that could carry oil eastward toward the Florida Keys and up the U.S. Eastern Seaboard .
` ` The southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the southwest and potentially into the Loop <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> , '' NOAA said on its website , referring to the deep ocean stream that transfers heat from the tropics to higher latitudes and becomes the Gulf Stream .
Officials have stressed the spill has had minimal impact on the shoreline and wildlife , but oil debris and tar balls were washing up on barrier islands and outlying beaches in at least a dozen places in Louisiana , Alabama and Mississippi .
` ` As nasty as they are , they are more manageable than a slick .
They can be collected .
They can be cleaned and we have crews doing that , '' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Luke Pinneo , referring to the tar balls found on Grand Isle , Louisiana .
Scientists and residents of the Gulf Coast say a greater concern is the anticipated encroachment of oil into the environmentally fragile bayous and marshes teeming with shrimp , oysters , crabs , fish , birds and other wildlife .
The New York Times and other media reported scientists had detected huge oil plumes -- large columns of concentrated oil moving beneath the ocean surface -- in the Gulf , indicating the leak could be worse than estimates by BP and the government .
Estimates of the rate of escaping oil range widely from the official BP figure of 5,000 barrels per day -LRB- 210,000 gallons\/795 , 000 liters -RRB- , adopted by the government , to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- per day .
BP said it had no confirmation of such undersea oil plumes and its spokesman , Andrew Gowers , appeared to dismiss the reports as scientifically unlikely .
` ` It is my observation as a layman that oil is lighter than water and tends to go up , '' Gowers told reporters .
BP is facing growing political pressure to prove it will pay for all of the costs related to the spill .
Salazar and Napolitano demanded in a letter to BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward that the company make clear its commitment to ` ` redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill . ''
The letter was released on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2010-05-15">Saturday</TIMEX3> and amid concerns about the implications of a U.S. law that limits energy companies ' liability for lost business and local tax revenues from oil spills to $ 75 million .
BP spokesman David Nicholas said : ` ` What they are requesting in the letter is absolutely consistent with all our public statements on the matter .
President Barack Obama 's administration wants to raise the liability limit retroactively .

To all the morons yelling ` ` drill baby drill '' <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is the time for you idiots to all move down to the gulf coast and buy some real estate .
<TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> is the time put your money where your mouth is and demonstrate to the nation what ` ` patriots '' you really are .
Afterall , this is the price we must all pay so we can continue to drive gas guzzling SUVs , right ?
It 's just to much of a sacrifice to do the right thing for our planet and all those -LRB- fisherman , local businesses , and really everybody living on the coast -RRB- living in gulf coast communities .
This country has become a nation full of spoiled , destructive children .
Go see the world <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> folks , there is n't going to much left in <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">20 years</TIMEX3> .
Well , if they do n't drill , are you prepared to pay $ 7 gallon of gas or 3 - 5x more for your ` ` green '' energy ?

Or see costs for everything from tires to toothpaste go up 10 - 30 % ?

If so , then let 's stop drilling <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="2010-05-16">today</TIMEX3> .
Beware what you wish for ... .
sabotage ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
sabotage ! ! ! !
SUV 'S RULE -- climate crisis is false .
You are so stupid .
I will make a travel plan for <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2030">2030</TIMEX3> with confidence .
