LONDON | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2011-01-06">Jan 6 , 2011</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="TIME" value="2011-01-06T24:01">12:01 pm</TIMEX3> EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Shares in BP and Transocean rose on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2011-01-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> as investors bet a new Presidential panel report that spreads the blame for the country 's worst - ever oil spill means the companies will avoid a highly costly gross negligence charge .
BP 's London - listed shares were up 1 percent at 504 pence at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2011-01-06T14:49">1449 GMT</TIMEX3> , while Transocean 's U.S.-listed shares were up 1.8 percent at $ 74.57 .
The STOXX 600 European oil and gas sector index was up 1 percent , on higher oil prices .
The report blamed the rig blast and subsequent spill on bad decision - making by BP , drilling contractor Transocean and well cementer Halliburton , which it said highlighted bad industry practice and regulatory shortcomings .
Haliburton shares traded down 1.4 percent at $ 38.86 after the report accused the company of using an unproven cement mix to seal the well , which subsequently blew out .
The company denied the accusation .
Investors and analysts said the fact that the blame for the blowout was shared so widely suggested BP and Transocean were less likely to be pinned with a allegation of gross negligence .
Under U.S. law , BP faces fines of $ 5 billion because the spill happened on its exploration block .
However , the fines could rise above $ 21 billion if Europe 's second - largest oil company by market value was found to have been grossly negligent in the run - up to the blast .
Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon , said comments made in the report that the management failure which caused the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig reflected industry - wide flaws , also made BP appear less culpable .
And while the report was damning , Richard Griffith , analyst at Evolution Securities said it could also mean BP can offload some of the costs of cleaning up the spill onto its contractors .
` ` The report may provide grounds for BP to claw back monies from license partners and possibly Transocean and Halliburton , '' he said in a research note .
BP shares have gained over 60 percent since falling below 300 pence at the height of the crisis in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-06">June last year</TIMEX3> .
Halliburton and Transocean 's shares have also recovered , although their performance has lagged that of rivals since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-11">November</TIMEX3> when the Presidential panel began making statements that shifted the focus of blame away from BP alone and toward its contractors .
Shares in BP 's partner in the well , Anadarko Petroleum , were also hit since it stands liable for 25 percent of the spill costs but the explorer 's shares have <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> been buoyed by takeover speculation .
Meanwhile BP has selected a new director of communications , sources familiar with the matter said on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2011-01-06">Thursday</TIMEX3> , as it seeks to rebuild its image in the wake of the spill .
Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .
Just look at their track record .
They are pointing fingers every way but theirs by trying to pass the buck onto the contractors !
BP as Operator -LRB-
well owner -RRB-
and their engineers are in total control of all well operations .
This is the industry standard It s the Well Operator engineer s responsibility to evaluating and ensure the job , equipment , procedures and personnel meet all company , local , state , and federal regulations .
As Operator BP had the responsibility and they failed ! !
Do n't know about the rest of you , but I am sure the Voters of Texas are proud of Joe Barton for his apology to BP for being held to account for this disaster .
His ` ` serving '' as a Senator from Texas does not seem to get in the way of his shilling for the Oil Industry .
As expected , Obama has found the way to insure his financial supporters are n't hurt no matter how badly they damage America .
His financial buddies destroyed the world economy and nothing was done about it .
His corporate oil buddies destroyed billions of dollars of citizen value and nothing will happen .
Fascist America protects its own -LRB- ers -RRB- .
