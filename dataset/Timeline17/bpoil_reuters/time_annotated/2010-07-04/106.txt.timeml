Reuters -RRB- - A supertanker adapted to scoop up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico began tests <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2010-07-03">Saturday</TIMEX3> amid a report that some major investors expect the energy giant to replace its top executives .
The vessel named ` ` A Whale '' and dubbed a ` ` super skimmer '' is operating just north of the blown out well as part of a two - day test watched by the U.S. Coastguard , said Bob Grantham , spokesman for TMT Shipping Offshore , which owns the ship .
If all goes to plan TMT hopes to sign a clean - up contract for the ship , which can remove up to 500,000 barrels -LRB- 21 million gallons -RRB- of oil and water mix from the sea surface <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> , according to crew members .
Efforts by BP to contain the damage returned to normal after a hurricane and the British company said its oil - capture systems at its leaking well collected or burnt off 25,290 barrels of oil during operations <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2010-07-02">Friday</TIMEX3> .
The storm passed through the spill area off the coast of Louisiana without doing major damage .

But the corporate fall - out from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history appeared far from over .
The Financial Times newspaper reported BP investors expected to see a change in the company 's leadership , possibly once the leak is capped , with both Chief Executive Tony Hayward and Chairman Carl - Henric Svanberg in jeopardy .
` ` When this is over there will be a full investigation , and we would expect some action to replace the top team , '' the British newspaper quoted a top 10 UK shareholder as saying in its <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2010-07-03">Saturday</TIMEX3> edition .
Without steps to steady the ship , BP could become a takeover target of companies like ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell or PetroChina , the FT said , citing a source working on BP 's strategy .
A BP spokesman declined to comment .
BP 's market capitalization has shrunk by about $ 100 billion -LRB- 65.7 billion pounds -RRB- and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began .
Company executives have been under intense pressure since an <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2010-04-20">April 20</TIMEX3> rig explosion killed 11 workers and unleashed the torrent of oil <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> threatening wildlife and the tourist and fishing industries in the Gulf region .
The Obama administration has also criticized the company 's response to the crisis , <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its 75th day .
The U.S. Interior Department , one of the departments spearheading Washington 's response to the spill , could issue a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium for U.S. waters in the <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming week</TIMEX3> .
A federal court <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2010-W25">last week</TIMEX3> lifted a six - month drilling ban imposed by the Obama administration as a result of the spill .
The new moratorium is expected to be more flexible and could be adjusted to allow drilling in certain subsea fields .
The supertanker works by allowing polluted water to enter 12 horizontal slits near its port and starboard bow .
The liquid then enters a series of tanks where the oil is decanted and then stored for later transfer to a separate vessel .
Test results are due <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-06-28">Monday</TIMEX3> , Grantham said , but crew members are confident of success because of a previous test off the coast of Portugal where the ship was fitted out and because the process follows established principles of physics .
The total amount of oil and water mix from the spill remains unknown but the ship could in theory greatly boost the amount being collected <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EACH">each day</TIMEX3> .
Apart from economic damage , the spill is seen as an environmental catastrophe for the Gulf coast .
Whale sharks , the biggest fish in the sea , may be the latest victims .
Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2010-W26">this week</TIMEX3> that four of the polka - dotted creatures , stretching about 40 feet -LRB- 12 metres -RRB- in length , had been spotted swimming in oily water in search of food .
Since whale sharks are filter feeders -- scooping up plankton and small fish as they swim just beneath the surface -- scientists are concerned they could be harmed or killed from swallowing large amounts of oil .
` ` The problem is that these are surface feeding animals and if they digest the oil they will sink and we will not know how many are dying , '' said Dr. Eric Hoffmayer of the University of Southern Mississippi .
` ` I do n't think there is any question we 're going to lose whale sharks to this oil spill .
That 's why we need to tag these sharks so that we can determine how they are impacted by the oil , '' Hoffmayer told Reuters <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2010-07-02">Friday</TIMEX3> .
