Reuters -RRB- - About 25,000 British fans are expected to descend on Las Vegas for Ricky Hatton 's IBO light - welterweight title defense against Filipino Manny Pacquiao on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> , despite the global economic downturn .
` ` For Ricky Hatton to be able to bring 25,000 Brits to Las Vegas because he has a fight , even when most of them do n't have tickets , is incredible , '' promoter Bob Arum told Reuters on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Around 4,500 fans crammed into the MGM Grand 's Garden Arena for <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">Friday</TIMEX3> 's weigh - in while many more were turned away .
` ` It was probably the biggest weigh - in we ' ve ever had , '' said Richard Sturm , president of sports and entertainment for MGM Mirage .
According to former middleweight and light - heavyweight champion Bernard Hopkins , the huge turnout gave further proof that boxing was still in excellent shape .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Today</TIMEX3> showed that boxing is n't going anywhere , '' Hopkins told Reuters .
` ` The pay - per - view numbers are going to show , I believe , that boxing is alive as long as people are getting something they can be excited about . ''
Hopkins , who is <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a partner with Golden Boy Promotions who look after Hatton , said the struggling economy had placed an extra burden on organisers to produce competitive bouts .
` ` We ' ve got to take risks because <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> people are choosing wisely with their dollars , '' he said .
` ` They 're not going to buy tickets just because your name is Bernard Hopkins if you 're fighting Donald Duck . ''
Boxing experts are eagerly anticipating <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> 's 12 - round bout because of its competitiveness and unpredictability .
Although Pacquiao is widely regarded as the best pound - for - pound fighter in the world , he has never fought at light - welterweight where Hatton is unbeaten after 44 bouts .
However Sturm said the popularity of the two fighters in their respective countries had been another significant factor in the fight 's huge interest .
` ` Both of these fighters have tremendous fan bases , '' he said .
` ` They 're icons and they both have the same number of fans .
` ` The British fans may be louder but Pacquiao has a fan base here -LRB- in the U.S.
-RRB- that is n't all from the Philippines .
He has a history of great fights in the States . ''
Ultimately , Hopkins argued , the sport will withstand the economic downturn in the same way it has overcome previous obstacles .
` ` Boxing has survived the Depression , it survived the Mob , '' he said .
` ` It 'll survive everything , including the swine flu . ''
