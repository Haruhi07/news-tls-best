Reuters -RRB- - Travelers quarantined in a Hong Kong hotel for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> after a Mexican guest tested positive for H1N1 flu expressed frustration on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> at the tough steps and a medical expert said authorities had over - reacted .
Police wearing surgical masks sealed off the Metropark hotel on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="TIME" value="2009-05-01TNI">Friday night</TIMEX3> after test results on the 25 - year - old Mexican man were confirmed .
They ordered the approximately 200 guests and 100 staff to stay in the hotel for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P7D">the next seven days</TIMEX3> .
The measures taken by the authorities in Hong Kong underscore the concern here about the new flu and the confirmed case , Asia 's first .
Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P1DE" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a decade</TIMEX3> .
` ` As this is the first confirmed case in the Greater China region and there is still little information about the severeness of the influenza , we need to be very cautious in dealing with the situation .
We decided to take comprehensive and stringent measures to prevent any massive outbreak in Hong Kong , '' a government spokeswoman said .
Officials said no one would be allowed to leave the hotel in the Wanchai district , an area popular with tourists .
` ` It just feels surreal because you are trapped , '' said Juliet Keys , who arrived from Singapore on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> to attend and planned to leave on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-04-26">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
` ` I ' m fine but it is a bit frustrating because I have a three - and - a - half year old daughter -LRB- and husband -RRB- in Singapore . ''
Keys , speaking to Reuters by telephone , said she was given a health check and a 10 - day course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu .
Health officials held a briefing for those inside , Keys said .
` ` People are pretty good .

A few are emotional , frustrated at not being able to get out because of things like work commitments , '' Keys said , adding guests had been given rice and some side dishes to eat .
A frustrated Australian man in the hotel told local television by telephone he wanted to leave .
Brice Chevallereau , a French tourist , checked into the hotel on <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="TIME" value="2009-05-01TAF">Friday afternoon</TIMEX3> but did not stay the night .
When he returned to the hotel on <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> , he was told by authorities he would have to be quarantined .
` ` Why do I have to go inside ? ''
` ` I just stayed <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DURATION" value="PT2M">two minutes</TIMEX3> in the lobby .
It 's not fair . ''
PASSENGERS URGED TO COME FORWARD
The Mexican man arrived in Hong Kong from Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> following a stopover in Shanghai .
He developed a fever after arriving and took a taxi to a hospital on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="TIME" value="2009-04-30TEV">Thursday evening</TIMEX3> .
He is in a stable condition , officials said .
Authorities appealed for 142 passengers and crew on the same flight as the Mexican to report to health officials .
Lo Wing - lok , an infectious disease expert , said the government was over - reacting .
` ` He would have been infectious starting from the time he was on the plane .
Think about all the people around him on the plane , while he was going through customs , waiting for baggage , in the taxi , in the hotel and when he got to hospital , '' Lo said .
` ` So how can it be effective if the government is just trying to isolate people in the hotel , it is a mission impossible . ''
Health officials said the ` ` essential needs '' of those inside the hotel would be looked after .
They would also get regular medical check - ups and psychologists were on standby .
News of the infected traveler caused jitters in Hong Kong and some people were taking no chances .
In subways , buses , ferry terminals and on the streets , more people went about their business on <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-05-02">Saturday</TIMEX3> wearing surgical masks , although some had masks fashioned out of cloth .
At the checkout counters in a supermarket , residents rifled through masks and sterilizers .
A sign nearby said : ` ` Prevent flu infection . ''
