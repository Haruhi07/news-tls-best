Most H1N1 patients do not need drugs to recover : WHO GENEVA | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">May 12 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2009-05-12T13:47">1:47 pm</TIMEX3> EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Most H1N1 flu patients do not require antiviral therapy to recover , but it remains important to develop a pandemic vaccine as there is a risk of future drug resistance , a World Health Organization expert said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
Nikki Shindo , a medical officer with the WHO 's global flu program , said the U.N. agency would soon publish new guidance about how to treat patients with the virus that has caused mainly mild symptoms outside of Mexico .
Given most patients can recover with rest and hydration , Shindo said there did not appear to be a need to treat all people infected with the strain with Tamiflu , Relenza , and similar antiviral drugs .
Saving such stockpiles for pregnant women and patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes may prove most prudent , she told a news conference .
` ` We will recommend to consider the use of antivirals for high risk groups , '' Shindo said , while allowing that because little is known about the new strain , it was possible antiviral drug use could be reducing its impact in Europe and elsewhere .
` ` It could be the reason why we are seeing less severe cases in Europe , '' she said in response to a journalist 's question .
But comparisons between regions were difficult due to a lack of control studies .
Shindo told reporters that about 10 percent of people known to have been infected with the strain known popularly as ` ` swine flu '' in Mexico and the United States required to be admitted to hospital -- far more than seen in regular seasonal flu .
` ` That I think has rightly urged the development and delivery of pandemic influenza vaccine , '' she told a news conference .
` ` We are also facing the risk of having resistant viruses , '' she said , noting that antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza have varying effectiveness against flu viruses as they mutate .
` ` Given that we will have <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">winter</TIMEX3> in southern American countries and also other parts of the southern hemisphere , there will be a risk of having viruses that will be highly resistant to antivirals , '' Shindo said .
