The new H1N1 flu virus could still mutate into a more virulent form and spark an influenza pandemic that could be expected to circle the globe up to three times , the World Health Organization said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The impact of any pandemic would vary , as a virus that causes only mild illness in countries with strong health systems can become ` ` devastating '' in those with weak health systems , shortages of drugs and poorly equipped hospitals , it said .
The new virus , commonly referred to as swine flu , ` ` appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza '' and nearly the world 's whole population lacks immunity to the new disease , the WHO said in a document issued overnight entitled ` ` Assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic . ''
` ` It attempts to explain different aspects of severity , not just the pathogenicity of the virus but its impact on health and social systems , '' WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham told Reuters .
` ` It is in response to questions from the public and media . ''
The United Nations agency 's pandemic alert level is at 5 , its second - highest level on a scale of 1 to 6 , he said .
This means that the virus shows no signs of sustained person - to - person spread outside North America .
Some 5,251 people have been infected in 30 countries , according to WHO 's tally on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-05-12">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , which includes 61 deaths .
Hardest hit are Mexico with 2,059 cases , including 56 deaths , and the United States with 2,600 cases including three deaths .
So far , with the exception of the deadly outbreaks in Mexico , the virus has tended to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people , it said .

But influenza viruses mutate frequently and unpredictably and ` ` the emergence of an inherently more virulent virus during the course of a pandemic can never be ruled out , '' the WHO said .
CIRCLING THE GLOBE IN WAVES ` ` The overall severity of a pandemic is further influenced by the tendency of pandemics to encircle the globe in at least two , sometimes three , waves , '' the WHO said .
` ` For many reasons , the severity of subsequent waves can differ dramatically in some or even most countries , '' it said .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> influenza pandemic -- which killed tens of millions of people -- began mild and returned within <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> in a much more lethal form , it said .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> pandemic began relatively mild , with sporadic cases prior to the first wave , and remained mild in its second wave in most , but not all countries , it said .
The new virus appears to be more easily spread than seasonal flu .
Regular seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent .
Seasonal flu has a so - called ` ` secondary attack rate '' -- the percentage of contacts who catch it from an infected person -- of between 5 and 15 percent , according to the WHO .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22 to 33 percent , '' it said .
Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness and all deaths have been in people with underlying chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease , asthma and diabetes , according to WHO which has consulted widely with experts in affected countries .
In Mexico and the United States -- the two largest and best documented outbreaks to date -- a younger age group has been affected than during seasonal epidemics of influenza , it said .
` ` Though cases have been confirmed in all age groups , from infants to the elderly , the youth of patients with severe or lethal infections is a striking feature of these early outbreaks , '' it said .
WHO acting assistant director - general Keiji Fukuda said on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">Monday</TIMEX3> it was not possible to produce a scientific assessment of the severity of the outbreak , on the lines of a hurricane warning , because of the unpredictable nature of the disease and the fact that different people and different countries experience the flu in different ways .
