An outbreak of the new strain , known as swine flu , that has killed at least 53 people -- mainly in Mexico -- has prompted some countries to ban pork from countries reporting human cases , even though officials have said there is no risk of spreading the virus by eating pork .
However , some pork producers are unsure how the virus could affect their animals .
The 22 piglets infected with the new virus showed flu - like symptoms between <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P4D">four days</TIMEX3> after infection and were shedding virus -- meaning they could spread it -- <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after infection , the researchers said .
None of the animals , also infected with the less dangerous H3N2 subtype , died , Roongroje Thanawongnuwech and colleagues from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok reported .
` ` The results of this study may assist in the prevention and control of swine influenza virus in Thailand , '' the researchers wrote in BioMed Central 's Virology Journal .
The new virus is a complex mix of swine viruses with avian and human bits , though nobody knows exactly where the new infection that first emerged in Mexico originated .
Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once .
The team found that all infected pigs developed respiratory symptoms such as nasal discharge , coughing , sneezing and conjunctivitis .
They also developed lung lesions large enough to be seen by the naked eye .
The lesions were characterised by dark plum - coloured , areas on the lung and were most severe <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> after infection .
This was especially the case in the H1N1 - infected pigs , where about a third of the lung was covered .
` ` The results demonstrated that both swine flu subtypes were able to induce flu - like symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs .
However the severity of the disease with regard to both gross and microscopic lung lesions was greater in the H1N1 - infected pigs , '' Thanawongnuwech said in a statement .
