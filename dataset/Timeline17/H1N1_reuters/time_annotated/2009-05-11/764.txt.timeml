The new strain of H1N1 flu that has killed 56 people in Mexico and has been carried around the world by travelers acts more like a pandemic strain than regular seasonal flu , researchers reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">Monday</TIMEX3> .
They said it was transmitted more easily and affects young adults more often than annual flu strains , justifying the World Health Organization 's stepped - up level of pandemic alert , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> a 5 , one step down from a full pandemic .
As many as 23,000 Mexicans were likely infected with the swine flu virus , Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and colleagues reported in the journal Science .
They also found evidence to support the theory that the outbreak originated in the village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz , which had been the subject of intense speculation .
` ` The dating -LRB- of the outbreak -RRB- was consistent with that , '' Christophe Fraser of Imperial College London said in a telephone interview .
The World Health Organization Rapid Pandemic Assessment Collaboration looked at both the pattern of disease spread and the early genetic analysis of the virus .
` ` I think the most important thing we found was the rate of spread and the extent of spread is similar to what has been seen in previous pandemics , '' Fraser added .
` ` Our estimates suggest that 23,000 individuals had been infected in Mexico by <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> , giving an estimated case fatality ratio of 0.4 percent based on confirmed and suspect deaths reported to that time , '' they wrote .
` ` Thus while substantial uncertainty remains , clinical severity appears less than that seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> but comparable with that seen in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> . ''
The <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic was the worst of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="19">the 20th century</TIMEX3> , killing anywhere between 25 million and 100 million people , depending on estimates .
It was the first appearance of the H1N1 virus .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> pandemic of H2N2 killed an estimated 2 million people globally .
Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent .
Looking at the pattern in La Gloria , the researchers said it looked as if the virus was transmitted human to human over 14 to 73 generations -- meaning one person infected another , who infected another , up to 73 times .
` ` Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than seasonal flu , '' they wrote .
The first case was seen in La Gloria around <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-02-15">February 15</TIMEX3> , they wrote , citing reports and not hard evidence .
But quick genetic analysis suggests the virus may have first infected someone around <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2010-01-12">January 12</TIMEX3> .
` ` As the epidemic spreads further , it is likely that severity will vary from country to country depending on health care resources and the public health measures adopted to mitigate impact , '' they added .
Globally , WHO has confirmed 4,694 infections in 30 countries .
Sixty deaths have been confirmed , most in Mexico with three in the United States and one in Canada .
While it is widespread across the United States , WHO said the new H1N1 virus shows no signs of sustained person - to - person spread outside of North America .
