Reuters -RRB- - A new gene map of Mexicans show they are as diverse as their history suggests and could benefit from having their own , unique analysis when it comes to testing drugs and assessing disease risks , researchers reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">Monday</TIMEX3> .
They studied 300 mestizos -- people of mixed ethnic heritage -- and found many different genetic variations that pointed to Indian , European and African ancestry .
They also compared these sequences to those found among 30 ethnic Indians .
` ` This study makes clear that Latin Americans with mixed ancestry are different enough from other people worldwide that a full - scale genomic mapping project would be wise both scientifically and economically , '' said Dr. Julio Frenk of the Harvard School of Public Health , a former Mexican minister of health .
` ` It would allow doctors to analyze fewer genetic markers when diagnosing the risk that a patient will develop a disease that depends on complex factors . ''
Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers said they found 89 common gene variations that could not be found in the so - called HapMap Project -- an international collaboration cataloging genetic similarities and differences among human beings .
` ` This effort will contribute to the design of better strategies aimed at characterizing the genetic factors underlying common complex diseases in Mexicans , '' wrote Gerardo Jimenez - Sanchez and colleagues at Mexico 's National Institute of Genomic Medicine .
` ` In addition , this information will increase our knowledge of genomic variability in Latino populations . ''
The findings apply more broadly than only Mexico , Jimenez - Sanchez and colleagues said .
` ` More than 560 million people live in Latin American countries , and according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population reached 45.5 million in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , representing the largest and fastest - growing minority group in the United States , '' they wrote .
The study may shed light on why the new H1N1 swine flu virus killed so many people in Mexico -- 56 , at last count , compared to three in the United States and one in Canada .
` ` It is not possible <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">today</TIMEX3> to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 influenza A mortality rate in Mexico , '' Jimenez - Sanchez said in a statement .
` ` However , knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases , including infections such as the flu . ''
