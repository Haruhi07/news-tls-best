Reuters -RRB- - Testing whether a person has swine flu is not easy and it can take days to confirm that suspected cases are actually caused by the virus , a health expert said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The World Health Organization has confirmed 79 cases of a virus it said has spread from Mexico -- where it has killed up to 149 people -- into the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Europe , raising fears of a pandemic .
But officials suspect more than 1,600 people may have the infection -- a disparity explained in part because there is no quick test , said Andrew Easton , a virologist at the University of Warwick in Britain .
` ` Many countries <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> will have several labs to carry this out , '' he told Reuters in a telephone interview .
` ` You ca n't do this in the field . ''
WHO officials only report cases that have been confirmed by their own staffers , in their own labs , at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a few other places .
Mexico , for instance , ships samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta or Winnipeg in Canada for testing .

While testing for seasonal flu is relatively simple , doing the same for H1N1 is far more complicated and none of the three techniques are widely available .
One way to confirm swine flu is with a test that involves growing a virus culture in a lab and then sequencing its genetic material .
Testing increases of antibodies and a technique called real - time PCR are the other approaches .
The PCR technique -- which researcher Easton called the most efficient -- uses a device to amplify copies of genes so researchers can easily compare a sample taken from a sick person to the genetic material of the potentially pandemic infection .
` ` You start with a small number of copies of the virus genes and the technique multiplies them up in a test tube to give them many hundreds of thousands of copies of the virus genes which are easy to measure , '' Easton said .
The first step for doctors and health officials is often collecting a sample at a local clinic or hospital and then sending it on to a more well - equipped lab for analysis .
This can produce some of the biggest delays .
Next researchers must purify the sample to get rid of natural compounds that may interfere with a reading -- something that also takes time , Easton said .
` ` Once you know the genetic makeup of the virus , the machine can tell whether the -LRB- genetic -RRB- sequence is that of the suspected infection , '' Easton said .
` ` If everything was optimized and there were plenty of people around to handle the result you could easily get a result that day . ''
The PCR device itself can within <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PTXH">a few hours</TIMEX3> compare the genetic makeup of the sample with that of a pandemic virus , Easton said .
But a challenge for researchers is designing a test that health officials can conduct in the field , he added .
` ` It is technology that is stopping us from doing that at the moment , '' Easton said .
