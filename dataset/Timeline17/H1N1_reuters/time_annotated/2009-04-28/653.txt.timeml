What 's in a name ?
U.S. pork producers are finding that the name of the virus spreading from Mexico is having an impact on their business , prompting U.S. officials to argue for changing the name from swine flu .
At a press briefing , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack took pains to repeatedly refer to the flu as the ` ` H1N1 virus . ''
Israel has rejected the name swine flu , and opted to call it ` ` Mexico flu . ''
Jewish dietary laws forbid eating pork .
The Paris - based World Organization for Animal Health also objected to the name , saying the virus contains avian and human components and no pig so far has been found ill with the disease .
And there is growing sentiment in the farm sector to call it the North American virus .
For U.S. pork producers the swine flu name has hurt , forcing government officials into the position of stressing that American pork is safe to eat and that other countries should not ban imports .
Pork , soybean and corn prices have fallen in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2D">the last two days</TIMEX3> , ` ` and if this continues , obviously you have significant potential , which is why it 's important to get this right , '' Vilsack said .
` ` This is not a food - borne illness , virus .
It is not correct to refer to it as swine flu because really that 's not what this is about , '' he said .
