Virtually all cases of the most common strain of flu circulating in the United States <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> resist the main drug used to treat it , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-03-02">Monday</TIMEX3> .
CDC researchers said 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to Roche AG 's Tamiflu , a pill that can both treat flu and prevent infection .
Four patients infected with the resistant strain have died , including two children .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009">This year</TIMEX3> , H1N1 is the most common strain of flu in the United States , although the flu season is a mild one so far , and still below the levels considered an epidemic .
Few doctors even test patients for flu , and Tamiflu is not widely prescribed .
But the news is sobering because the pill , known generically as oseltamivir , is one of the few weapons against influenza , which kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States in an average year .
It is also considered a key weapon against a potential pandemic of a new type of influenza , and this study suggests the virus can rapidly evade its effects .
This season , nine children have died from influenza , most apparently healthy before they got infected , the CDC reports .
Last flu season , only 19 percent of H1N1 viruses tested were Tamiflu - resistant , Dr. Nila Dharan and colleagues at the CDC reported .
` ` As of <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-02-19">February 19 , 2009</TIMEX3> , resistance to oseltamivir had been identified among 264 of 268 -LRB- 98.5 percent -RRB- U.S. influenza
A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- viruses tested , '' the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
They interviewed 99 patients and found 30 percent of them had been vaccinated against flu but became infected anyway .
The vaccine is known not to fully protect against infection .
` ` Two patients died on the way to the hospital or in the emergency department .
One patient was 4 years old and previously healthy , and one patient was 4 years old with neurological problems , '' Dharan 's team wrote .
Dr. David Weinstock of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Gianna Zuccotti of Brigham and Women 's Hospital , both in Boston , said the quick spread of Tamiflu - resistant flu had surprised doctors .
` ` Undoubtedly , new surprises await in the perpetual struggle with influenza as one thing is certain -- the organism will continue to evolve , '' they wrote .
` ` For <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , the best tools to mitigate influenza infection are tried - and - true -- vaccination , social distancing , hand washing , and common sense . ''
GlaxoSmithKline , which makes the rival flu drug Relenza , said there was no indication influenza viruses were resistant to its drug .
Relenza , known generically as zanamivir , is inhaled and is used even less commonly than Tamiflu .
Flu already resists two older drugs , rimantadine and amantadine .
There is no indication the two other types of season flu <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> circulating , H3N2 and influenza B , resist the effects of Tamiflu and the CDC recommends using a cocktail of flu drugs in patients <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
` ` Hundreds of thousands of flu patients continue to be treated with Tamiflu this season , '' Roche said in a statement .
` ` Treatment with antivirals such as Tamiflu can lessen the duration and severity of illness and can help curb the spread of flu , especially in crowded settings like households , schools and nursing homes . ''
