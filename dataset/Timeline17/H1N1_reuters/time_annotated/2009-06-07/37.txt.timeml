The gun battle , near tourist hotels in the Pacific Ocean resort , was a further blow to Mexico 's tourism industry , already reeling from cancellations by foreigners scared away by the swine flu epidemic .
Gunmen battled troops from a cartel safe house , throwing hand grenades at soldiers who had surrounded them and spraying gunfire into military vehicles and nearby homes .
The shooting began late on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-06-06">Saturday</TIMEX3> and went on until after midnight .
` ` There were grenade and rocket explosions , and weapons like AK-47s , '' said an employee of a neighboring hotel .
` ` The fight lasted <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT2H" mod="LESS_THAN">almost two hours</TIMEX3> . ''
Sixteen suspected members of the Beltran Leyva drug gang were killed as well as two soldiers , including a captain .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has staked his presidency on crushing drug gangs whose turf wars have killed about 2,300 people <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> .
Some 45,000 troops and federal police have been deployed across the country .
While the clash was several miles away from the main area where foreign tourists stay in high - rise hotels , a resurgence of violence in Acapulco is bad news for the tourism industry .
Rival drug gangs fought over territory in Acapulco , home to around a million people , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">several years ago</TIMEX3> , but the resort has been relatively free of drug violence in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> .
Tourism , a key industry for Mexico , took a hit in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-04" mod="END">late April</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-05" mod="START">early May</TIMEX3> when the H1N1 flu virus spread through Mexico and scared off travelers .
Violence associated with drugs across Mexico has damaged investor sentiment and the U.S. government is concerned about instability in Mexico , an ally and big oil supplier .

Drug violence has also hurt Mexican beach resorts , like Cancun and Ixtapa .
The Beltran Leyva gang , rivals of the powerful Sinaloa cartel , is believed to dominate the drug trade around Acapulco , a popular destination for vacationing U.S. college students .
