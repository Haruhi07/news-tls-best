HONG KONG | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-04-15">Apr 15 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2009-04-15T05:56">5:56 am</TIMEX3> EDT HONG KONG -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Scientists in Hong Kong and the United States have identified a synthetic compound which appears to be able to stop the replication of influenza viruses , including the H5N1 bird flu virus .
The search for such new ` ` inhibitors '' has grown more urgent in <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> as drugs , like oseltamivir , have become largely ineffective against certain flu strains , like the H1N1 seasonal flu virus .
Experts <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> question how well and how long the drug would stand up against the H5N1 , should it unleash a pandemic .
Researchers in Hong Kong and the Unites States screened some 230,000 compounds that were catalogued with the U.S. National Cancer Institute , and found 20 that could potentially restrict the proliferation of the H5N1 .
The experts told a news conference on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-04-15">Wednesday</TIMEX3> one of the compounds , compound 1 or NSC89853 , showed promise .
` ` We have found a compound that is different from oseltamivir but which acts in the same way , '' said Leo Poon , a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong .
` ` An analogy would be like we have a door with a keyhole , but the hole has changed , and the key , in this case oseltamivir , ca n't lock the door anymore , '' he told the news conference .
` ` But we have discovered another keyhole and another key which can lock the door . ''
Their finding was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry .
In their experiment , the researchers infected separate batches of cultured human cells with seasonal flu virus and H5N1 and found that compound 1 prevented the replication of both types of viruses effectively .
` ` Given the problems with drug resistance , this compound can be used to develop a new drug , '' said Allan Lau , professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Hong Kong .
But he cautioned it would take as much as <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P8Y">eight years</TIMEX3> for such a drug to be available on the market .
Many advanced countries stock up on oseltamivir and zanamivir , two varieties of the same class of drugs that stops the H5N1 virus from multiplying .
But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> that 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to oseltamivir , which is manufactured by Roche AG and marketed under the brand Tamiflu .
Viruses and bacteria are sturdy organisms that fight hard to survive and adapt swiftly to drugs that are used to kill them , quickly becoming resistant to them .
