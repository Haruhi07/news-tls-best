The man , traveling with his family from the United States via Amsterdam , was diagnosed after arriving at Istanbul 's Ataturk Airport en route to Iraq on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">Friday</TIMEX3> , Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag said at a news conference .
Six family members traveling with the man were also quarantined at a Turkish research hospital , where they were being given anti - viral medication , Akdag said .
Tests showed the man 's mother was also infected with the H1N1 virus , Harun Celik , the Health Ministry 's spokesman , told Reuters .
Local media had reported earlier the man 's wife was suffering from the disease , but Celik denied those reports .
` ` His mother also tested positive for swine flu .
None of the other family members have any health issues , '' Celik said .
The entire family will be held for observation until <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-05-21">May 21</TIMEX3> to determine whether they may have contracted swine flu , because the virus takes <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1W" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to a week</TIMEX3> to manifest itself , Akdag said .
India on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> also reported its first victim of the H1N1 virus .
The spread of the disease has led the World Health Organisation to declare a pandemic is imminent .
India and Turkey are the 37th and 38th countries to confirm cases of H1N1 virus .

The WHO said on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-05-16">Saturday</TIMEX3> 72 people had died from the disease or its complications .
The Iraqi - American family was traveling on a KLM aircraft to Istanbul that was carrying 163 passengers , most of whom are <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> being monitored for signs of the flu , Akdag said .
` ` We know of the existence of a few -LRB- passengers -RRB- whom we ' ve been unable to contact , '' Akdag said .
` ` They need to be alert so that they can be given preventative medicine and in order to protect others . ''
Thermal cameras set up at the Istanbul airport had detected the man had a high fever , and tests at the national laboratory revealed he was carrying the H1N1 virus , Akdag said .
` ` Everything is under control , '' Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told reporters when asked about the diagnosis of the country 's first H1N1 case .
` ` Everything is being monitored closely . ''

The WHO has said there were 8,451 confirmed cases of infections with the influenza strain that is a mixture of swine , bird and human viruses .
