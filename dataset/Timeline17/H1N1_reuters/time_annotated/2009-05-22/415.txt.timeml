Reuters -RRB- - Countries should be ready for more serious H1N1 flu infections and more deaths from the newly discovered virus , World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-05-22">Friday</TIMEX3> .
The highly contagious strain must be closely monitored in parts of Asia , Africa and South America where <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">the winter</TIMEX3> season is beginning in case it mixes with seasonal flu and mutates in ` ` unpredictable ways , '' Chan told the closing session of her United Nations agency 's annual congress .
` ` In cases where the H1N1 virus is widespread and circulating within the general community , countries must expect to see more cases of severe and fatal infections , '' she said .
` ` We do not at present expect this to be a sudden and dramatic jump in severe illness and deaths . ''
In the WHO 's latest tally , the strain has infected more than 11,000 people in 42 countries and killed 86 .
Chan told the end of the week - long World Health Assembly that poorer countries need to quickly improve their monitoring for the new flu , which has caused mainly mild symptoms in most patients but could become more serious as it spreads .
` ` This is a subtle , sneaky virus , '' she said .
` ` We have clues , many clues , but very few firm conclusions . ''
Another senior WHO official , Keiji Fukuda , later told a news conference the United Nations agency was rethinking its criteria for declaring a full H1N1 pandemic is underway to factor in its severity as well as its geographical spread .
` ` What we are looking for and what we will be looking for is something , events , which signify a really significant increase in risk of harm to people , '' said Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director - general .

The WHO 's global flu alert is <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> at level 5 out of 6 , meaning that a pandemic is ` ` imminent . ''
Officials from the WHO 's 193 member states have been pushing <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-W21">this week</TIMEX3> for an altered definition of a Phase 6 pandemic to reduce the risk of unnecessary public panic .
` ` The bottom line here is we are trying to walk a very fine line between not raising panic but also not becoming complacent , '' Fukuda said , adding that criteria would be reviewed <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that the assembly had ended .

The WHO 's <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> rulebook requires a full pandemic to be declared once the air - borne virus is spreading in a sustained way in two regions of the world .
The H1N1 strain has been most prevalent in North America and has also caused growing pockets of infection in Japan , Spain and Britain .
Chan said there was little real difference between the WHO 's <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> pandemic alert level of 5 and the highest of 6 in terms of preparedness measures taken , and she would consult experts before opting to raise it again .
` ` The decision to declare an influenza pandemic is a responsibility and a duty that I take very , very seriously , '' she said .
` ` I will consider all the scientific information available .
I will be advised by the emergency committee . ''
The WHO expects that by <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-05" mod="END">the end of May</TIMEX3> , laboratories will be able to send candidate viruses to drug companies to be tested as vaccine viruses , according to Fukuda .
` ` We are hopeful that by <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-06" mod="END">the end of June</TIMEX3> , by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-07" mod="START">the beginning of July</TIMEX3> , this will be the time when commercial companies will be in the position of beginning to , or being able to make H1N1 vaccine , '' he said .
While the new flu virus dominated their meeting , officials also passed resolutions on the need to improve treatment of multi - drug - resistant tuberculosis and prepare for a surge in diseases including mosquito - borne malaria due to global warming .
