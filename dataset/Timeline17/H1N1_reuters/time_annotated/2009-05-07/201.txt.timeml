Nigeria is Africa 's most populous country with a population of more than 140 million .

Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord , and can be caused by viral or bacterial infections .
It spreads mainly through kisses , sneezes , coughs and in close living quarters .
The meningitis death toll in Nigeria since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-12">December</TIMEX3> is almost 50 times the number of people killed worldwide by the H1N1 swine flu virus .

But the speed with which it has spread underscores the potential dangers if swine flu reaches Africa .
