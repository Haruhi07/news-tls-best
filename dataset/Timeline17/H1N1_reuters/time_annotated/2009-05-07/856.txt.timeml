Flu hygiene hard in slums as Mexico scrubs off flu CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico | Thu <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">May 7 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2009-05-07T16:26">4:26 pm</TIMEX3> EDT CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- -
The water dribbling from the tap is not enough for Miriam Guerrero to clean her fingernails , let alone wash down her hair salon in a Mexico City slum as the country fights a deadly flu virus .
With 44 people dead from the new H1N1 flu virus -- many of them in the sprawling capital of 20 million -- the government has urged Mexicans to scrub up as often as they can .
But while the wealthy hose down storefronts with disinfectant and squirt hand sanitizer gel abundantly , impoverished families in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl -- a vast , grimy slum on the northeast edge of the capital -- barely have running water .
Low rainfall has left Mexico City 's already strained reservoirs badly depleted , and taps are driest in the poorest areas .
Even though city officials have patched up leaky pipes several times , poor neighborhoods still suffer chronic shortages .
` ` When the water 's running short it 's not easy to keep washing your hands like they say , and there 's not enough to disinfect all the furniture , '' said Guerrero , who often fills her metal bucket from a water truck to clean her small salon .
Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl , known as ` ` Neza , '' and other poor neighborhoods like nearby Iztapalapa , largely rely on the trucks that come around sporadically .
Countries around the world are taking measures to halt the spread of the virus , which has infected more than 2,000 people in 24 countries .
After grinding almost to a halt for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> , Mexico and its capital were getting back to normal on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> , reopening schools , bars , churches and restaurants as health officials said the worst of Mexico 's outbreak was over .

But the government warned it was too early to stop taking hygiene measures .
Many people still wore face masks and Mexico City restaurants sanitized diners ' hands as they arrived .
Home to around 1 million people , Neza is infamous for being next to a huge open - pit garbage dump .
` ` We are worried about colds , the flu , especially being so close to the dump , '' said Alicia Soto , a vendor of sunflower seed snacks who took her daughter to the doctor <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">two weeks ago</TIMEX3> , alarmed by her flu - like symptoms .
Local health officials say they can not solve the water problem , but they are carting boxes filled with bottles of hand sanitizer to as many health clinics as they can .
