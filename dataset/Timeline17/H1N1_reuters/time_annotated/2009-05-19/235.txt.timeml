Mexico is sinking deeper into recession due to plunging demand for its exports from the United States and many analysts expect the economy will contract about 6 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> .
` ` It is a very deep crisis , '' Carstens said , referring to the global recession , which weighs especially heavily on exporting powerhouses like Mexico .
Mexico reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-05-18">Monday</TIMEX3> that industrial output fell 6.7 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> , in the eighth straight month of contraction .
Industrial production accounts for about 40 percent of the economy .
` ` These are readings that we will continue to see for some more months , '' said Carstens , speaking at an insurance conference .
At the same time , economists in the United States , where Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports , have increasingly pointed to signs that the U.S. recession is moderating .
` ` The sharp economic contraction and the sensation that demand is in freefall are abating , ''
Carstens said .
` ` It is likely that we will start <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> in a clear recovery , '' he said .
A rally in Mexico 's peso currency and in global equity markets are signs that investors are betting on recovery , he said .
The peso MXN = MEX01 rose to its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-11">November</TIMEX3> on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-19">Tuesday</TIMEX3> and the local stock market .
MXX hit its highest level since <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-10" mod="START">early October</TIMEX3> on optimism that the U.S. banking sector may be in recovery .
The outbreak in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> of the H1N1 influenza virus that forced the temporary shutdown of parts of Mexico 's economy is expected to further compound the economic problems .
Carstens reiterated his forecast that the flu outbreak would shave 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product .
Central bank Governor Guillermo Ortiz said on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-05-18">Monday</TIMEX3> the flu would likely cost 0.5 percent of GDP .
