MEXICO CITY | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-03">May 3 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2009-05-03T19:36">7:36 pm</TIMEX3> EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Mexico announced on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> that its swine flu epidemic had passed the worst and experts said the new H1N1 virus might be no more severe than normal flu , although it could still impact on world health .
Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the flu was easing but warned that it was too early for Mexico -- the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread to 19 countries -- to let down its guard .
The mayor of Mexico City , Marcelo Ebrard , said the capital of 20 million inhabitants was likely to resume normal activities on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> , observing certain health precautions , after a five - day partial shutdown to limit the virus ' spread .
Cordova said the H1N1 flu outbreak appeared to have peaked in Mexico between <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-04-23">April 23</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">28</TIMEX3> and fewer people had gone to hospitals with serious flu symptoms in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> .
` ` The evolution of the epidemic is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in its phase of descent , '' he told a news conference in Mexico City , where millions of people heeded government advice to stay at home .
After days of alarm that had kept streets eerily quiet , the atmosphere in Mexico City appeared more relaxed on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> , with some people venturing out on bikes or running .
Many no longer wore the surgical masks that have been almost obligatory in the city in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">the last week</TIMEX3> as residents feared infection .
But millions of Catholics stayed away from churches , watching <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> mass on television instead .
Mexican authorities have scaled back their estimate of deaths from the flu strain to over 100 , down from 176 .
Only 19 deaths in Mexico are confirmed as being caused by the new flu .

But new cases of the virus , which mixes swine , avian and human flu strains , still were being tracked across the world , keeping alive fears of the threat of a pandemic .
The World Health Organization said its laboratories had identified a total of 898 H1N1 flu infections in 18 countries , including one case in Italy .
Its toll lags national reports but is considered more scientifically secure .
The flu has spread to 30 U.S. states and infected 226 people , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .
It appears to be hitting mostly younger people , with very few cases reported in those over 50 years old .
CDC acting director Richard Besser said there were ` ` encouraging signs '' that the new strain was not more severe than what would be seen during normal seasonal flu .
But he still expected the virus to have a ` ` significant impact '' on people 's health .
` ` We 're not out of the woods , '' Besser told ` ` Fox News <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-05-03">Sunday</TIMEX3> . ''
The U.S. government said it hoped to have a vaccine ready for the new flu strain by <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> .
In Britain , Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the spread of the new flu strain had been contained there .
A World Health Organization spokesman said in Geneva its emergency committee had no meeting scheduled to review its global alert for the H1N1 flu , which it set <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">last week</TIMEX3> to 5 , one notch below pandemic level .
Health officials and scientists from around the world have been focusing on how the new mutated , mongrel flu strain may be passed between animals and humans .
The WHO said flu surveillance should be increased in both humans and animals <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> that the latest H1N1 strain was found to have infected pigs in Canada .
Canadian health officials said a traveler carried the virus from Mexico to Canada and infected his family and a pig herd .
Mexico has seen a stabilization of serious cases in <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> , bringing some relief to its population , millions of whom have stayed indoors in line with a government order for non - essential businesses to remain closed through <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> .
` ` We ' ve been indoors since <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-05-01">Friday</TIMEX3> .
So <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> we ' ve come out to enjoy some fresh air , '' cyclist Silvia Rodriguez told Reuters , relaxing on the grass of a central park in Mexico City .
Others were more wary .
` ` I ' m not totally convinced that the worst is over , '' said Juan Antonio Hernandez , 48 , a caretaker .
A Mexican Embassy official in China said Chinese authorities were quarantining more than 50 Mexican business people and tourists after some showed flu symptoms .
Asia 's trade and tourism could be hit by the latest flu outbreak but lessons learned from the SARS epidemic in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> would boost efforts to counter the effects .
SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , killed more than 800 people around the world in <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> after first appearing in southern China .
