UPDATE 1 - GSK says Asia Pacific sales could double in 5 yrs \ * Will lower prices in some Asian countries to boost sales \ * Says Australia , NZ , Taiwan , Singapore have bought Relenza -LRB- Recasts with Asia - Pacific sales forecast -RRB- SINGAPORE , <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">June 29</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline -LRB- GSK .
L -RRB- said its Asia - Pacific sales could double in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P5Y">five years</TIMEX3> as growing prosperity boosts demand for better healthcare and as it cuts prices in some Asian countries .
GSK Asia Pacific chief Christophe
Weber said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> the company aimed to boost sales in countries such as China , Indonesia and the Philippines by selling drugs and vaccines for less than it typically charged in developed countries .
` ` Clearly there will be a very high demand in the future because the economic development of the countries in the region and people want more healthcare , ''
Weber told Reuters on the sidelines of a regional media workshop in Singapore .
GSK Asia Pacific <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> chalked up 1.18 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2 billion -RRB- in sales <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> , accounting for just under 5 percent of the company 's total sales .
GSK estimates its Asia - Pacific pharmaceutical market share at 5.3 percent , making it the region 's fourth largest player .
Highlighting the region 's potential , GSK said Asia Pacific had twice the number of newborns compared with North America or Western Europe , but mortality rates for mothers were 12 times higher than in Europe .
For children under five , the mortality rate was 3 times higher than in the Americas .
A lot of the deaths in children in the region could have been prevented by vaccination had they been more accessible and affordable , Weber said .
` ` Price is one dimension , but it is a vital one .
You need to have an affordable vaccine , that 's one of the strategies we are accelerating , '' he said .
GSK opened a $ 411 million plant in Singapore <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-06">this month</TIMEX3> , its second site producing vaccine against pneumonia - causing bacteria .
It will take <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P2Y" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">up to two years</TIMEX3> to test the new plant before commercial production starts .
The other site is in Belgium .
Since the H1N1 outbreak began in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> , the governments of Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan and Singapore have bought GSK 's Relenza flu treatment , Weber said .
GSK said it has advised governments to buy and stock more of Relenza , which is used to treat flus such as the H1N1 virus that is spreading across the globe , for a more effective response in dealing with a viral outbreak .
` ` There have been some publications showing that there is some level of resistance developed for Tamiflu , '' Weber said of the product made by competitor Roche -LRB- ROG .
` ` In case there will be more resistance to Tamiflu , Relenza will be a good alternative . ''
GSK is also developing vaccine against the H1N1 flu virus , which is reported to have killed 306 worldwide and infected at least 67,000 as of <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-06-26">June 26</TIMEX3> .
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-06" mod="START">earlier this month</TIMEX3> declared the first flu pandemic of <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="20">the 21st century</TIMEX3> and advised governments to prepare for a long battle against H1N1 .
