As the confirmed number of Japanese infected with the H1N1 flu virus rises , the growing question among many is : Where can we buy face masks ?
Disposable masks have become an essential accessory in the worst - affected areas of western Japan , while a growing number of Tokyo commuters are wearing them .
The government has recommended use by those who suspect infection , but some businesses are ordering employees to wear them , especially if they have face - to - face client interaction .
And Japan 's upper house of parliament is requesting that everyone , including lawmakers , wear a mask when entering the chamber .
Not surprisingly , some pharmacies and drug stores have run out of stock , while shares of medical mask makers Shikibo and Daiwabo have shot up since the first case was confirmed in Tokyo .
Osaka - based Shikibo says orders in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2010-04">April</TIMEX3> alone exceeded by 25 percent the volume of the previous business year , and TV footage shows lines outside stores .
My cousin in Himeji , Hyogo Prefecture , says more than half the people on the street are wearing masks <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and the only reason she is n't is because there are no masks to buy .
Japan auction site , one box of 100 surgical face masks was auctioned at around $ 280 , compared with the original price of $ 20 .
One listed on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-15">Friday</TIMEX3> was offered at $ 5,000 for a box of 50 .
Masks are popular with Japanese who want to avoid passing on a cold or who have allergies , but flu - related demand <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> seems to be spreading to Tokyo , where ` ` Sold Out '' signs are becoming more common , along with a rising number of masked commuters .
Somewhat belatedly , perhaps , public broadcaster NHK stressed that wearing a mask does not provide full protection from catching flu , and once again reminded people to wash their hands .

Before moving to my <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> position , I specialised in Japan 's economic policy and macroeconomic news for <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="APPROX">about 10 years</TIMEX3> , with a concentration in reporting daily policy developments at Ministry of Finance , the Bank of Japan and other economic agencies .
