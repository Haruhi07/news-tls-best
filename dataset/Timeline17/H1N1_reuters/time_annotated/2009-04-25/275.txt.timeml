Experts agree another flu pandemic is overdue .
Here are some facts about past flu pandemics and pandemic threats : \ *
The <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> Spanish influenza pandemic is the benchmark by which all modern pandemics are measured .
Some 20 to 40 percent of the worldwide population became ill and more than 50 million people died .

The virus that caused the <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> Asian flu pandemic was quickly identified , and vaccines were available by <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1957-08">August 1957</TIMEX3> .

\ *
In <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="1976">1976</TIMEX3> , a strain of swine flu started infecting people in Fort Dix , New Jersey , and worried U.S. health officials because the virus was thought to be related to the <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> Spanish flu virus .
Forty million people were vaccinated but the program was halted after several cases of Guillain - Barre syndrome , a severe and sometimes fatal condition linked to some vaccines , were reported .
