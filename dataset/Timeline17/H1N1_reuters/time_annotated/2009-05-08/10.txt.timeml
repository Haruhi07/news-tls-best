Though Mexican officials said they were over the worst , Besser said the country still had significant transmission .
A THIRD OF THE WORLD More than 2,000 people in 24 countries have been infected with the virus , the World Health Organization said .
The WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda urged Asian governments to stay alert for a possible wider pandemic that ` ` could infect a third or more of the world 's population in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the next several months</TIMEX3> , in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2010">the next year</TIMEX3> .

According to a draft statement on <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-05-08">Friday</TIMEX3> , the Asian health ministers were concerned that most of the production capacity for vaccines was located in North America and Europe and it was inadequate for a global pandemic .
The 13 countries will look at screening people leaving affected areas but are not planning travel bans .
Evidence showed that ` ` imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading , but would be highly disruptive to the global and regional communities and pose major negative impacts on the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> global economic downturn '' , the statement said .
In a series of reports rushed into the New England Journal of Medicine on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-05-07">Thursday</TIMEX3> , researchers said influenza viruses from animals are an ongoing threat and doctors need to keep a lookout for them .
