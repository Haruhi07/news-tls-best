\ * Sees 2009 profits ` substantially less ' than previous view \ * Says all other businesses performing in line \
* Shares slump 30 percent -LRB- Recasts lead , adds share price , CEO , analyst comment -RRB- LONDON , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-08">May 8</TIMEX3>
-LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Emerging markets lender International Personal Finance -LRB- IPF .
L -RRB- said soaring loan default rates in recession - hit Hungary would eat into its profits <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> , knocking almost a third off the company 's share price .
IPF , which offers small loans to consumers in central Europe , Romania and Mexico , risked breaching its debt covenants if loan impairment rates worsened further , an analyst said , but the firm 's CEO denied this would happen .
` ` It is likely , as a result of the underperformance in Hungary , that the -LRB- profit -RRB- outcome for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> will be substantially less than our expectations , '' the company said on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-05-08">Friday</TIMEX3> .
Impairments in the country rose sharply in the first <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P4M">four months</TIMEX3> of the year , causing it to miss pretax profit targets by 8 million pounds .
Hungary 's government expects the economy , which has been hit by falling exports and weakening domestic demand , to contract by up to 6 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> , while the forint currency has fallen sharply in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the past six months</TIMEX3> , making it harder for local borrowers to repay loans taken out in hard currencies .
Analyst Nitin Arora at Noble said his clients had ` ` lost faith '' in IPF 's management team , and he believed bad loans as a proportion of the firm 's loan portfolio had risen to 31 percent .
` ` We estimate that if that ratio goes to 34 percent , they will breach the interest covenants , '' he said .
` ` Given the deteriorating macro environment and the uncertainty in all the economies in which IPF operates , we would not be surprised to see the 34 percent being hit . ''
IPF , which closed its Russian operations at <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-04" mod="END">the end of April</TIMEX3> , said it experienced a sharp downturn in loan collections in Poland , Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary , as the global recession hits consumers and unemployment rises .
But Chief Executive John Harnett told Reuters he did not expect impairments to rise to 34 percent and the firm would continue to operate within its covenants .
He said that , after a lull at the start of the year , collections in its largest markets of Poland and the Czech Republic improved in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> , a trend that was set to continue for the rest of the year .
Rates had stabilised in Hungary , albeit at a low level .
` ` We ' ve seen off the worst , '' he said .
IPF , which split from UK parent Provident Financial -LRB- PFG .
L -RRB- in <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2007-07">July 2007</TIMEX3> , said its operations in Mexico had not been affected by the outbreak of swine flu
and it was still on track to break into profit there for the first time .
Shares in IPF , which <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-03">two months ago</TIMEX3> reported a 40 percent rise in full - year pretax profit , tumbled 31 percent to 98.5 pence at <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="TIME" value="2009-05-08T13:04">1304 GMT</TIMEX3> , having hit a record low of 94 pence at <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-04" mod="START">the start of April</TIMEX3> .
