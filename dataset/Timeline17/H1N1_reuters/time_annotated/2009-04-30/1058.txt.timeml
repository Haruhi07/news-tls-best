Reuters -RRB- - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG will use data from a study on its pre - pandemic bird flu vaccine Aflunov and adjuvant MF59 to help develop a vaccine against the swine flu virus , it said on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Adjuvants are additives that help boost the effectiveness of vaccines .
A study showed that when MF59 was added to Aflunov it can provide a broadly - cross reactive immune response covering all known H5N1 antigenic variants , even when that booster dose is administered <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P6Y">six years</TIMEX3> after the initial dose .
Manufacturers have started to take the first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus that is being linked to the deaths of as many as 176 people in Mexico .
Ten countries have reported cases of the H1N1 strain .
` ` These data reinforce the potentially broad applicability of the MF59 adjuvant and the role it can play in pandemic preparedness efforts around the world , '' said Andrin Oswald , chief executive of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics .
` ` We will use these new insights , as well as our strong leadership position in cell based flu manufacturing , as part of our efforts to develop a vaccine against the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> swine flu outbreak , '' Oswald said .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="2009-04-30T07:18">0718 GMT</TIMEX3> , shares in the group had risen 1.3 percent to 43.28 , largely in line with the European pharmaceuticals sector .
Novartis said <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , meaning that it could start work on evaluating production and it hoped to get the actual virus in its laboratories in the near future .
The group also said on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> a Phase II study had shown that Aflunov provided a protective immune response in children from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DURATION" value="P17Y">17 years</TIMEX3> , making it the first and only pre - pandemic avian vaccine with a good safety profile and which is effective in building an immune response as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DURATION" value="P6M">6 months</TIMEX3> .
