SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">May 25 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2009-05-25T21:19">9:19 pm</TIMEX3> EDT SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Puerto Rico on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-05-25">Monday</TIMEX3> reported its first confirmed case of H1N1 swine flu -- a 39 - year - old man who had returned from <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> - long eastern Caribbean cruise .
The Dominican Republic said it was stepping up testing of people with flu symptoms after a Russian tourist who had spent <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P12D">12 days</TIMEX3> at Punta Cana , the country 's premier beach resort , was detected with the virus after he returned home .
The authorities in Puerto Rico , a U.S. Caribbean territory , said they were checking on the persons with whom the Puerto Rican man confirmed with the virus had been in contact after he came back from the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-10">May 10</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-17">17</TIMEX3> cruise .
They did not give details of the cruise ship he had been traveling on .
` ` This isolated case should not be cause for panic , '' Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortuno told a news conference .
Dominican Republic 's public health secretary , Bautista Rojas Gomez , said although none of the Caribbean state 's citizens had so far been diagnosed with swine flu , the case of the Russian indicated the virus was present in the country .
` ` The virus is circulating .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="PXW">the last few weeks</TIMEX3> the number of tourists in the zone has increased enormously and although this is good for the country economically , this increases the possibility of the virus circulating further , '' Rojas said .
Two Chileans and a Peruvian student who had spent time at Punta Cana were diagnosed with swine flu after leaving the Dominican Republic , according to media reports .
Caribbean countries ' tourist industries have been hit by the global economic downturn and fears of H1N1 contagion could deal a further blow to economies that look to foreign visitors to earn valuable hard currency .
Mexico remains the epicenter of the H1N1 outbreak , which the World Health Organization says has been detected in 46 countries and has killed more than 90 people globally .
