The death toll from a fire at <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> - care center in northern Mexico rose to 35 children with at least 40 more hospitalized , many with life - threatening burns , Mexican authorities said on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-06-06">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said he has ordered an investigation into <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-06-05">Friday</TIMEX3> 's fire at the ABC day - care center in the northern city of Hermosillo to find who is to blame .
As flames blocked the center 's doorway , employees and neighbors used cars to punch holes through a wall and stumbled over unconscious infants and toddlers as they tried to rescue them , witnesses said .
Smoke inhalation killed many children before rescuers could reach them , with the victims ranging in age from a few months old to about 3 years old , authorities said .
It was unclear where or how the fire started , although it may have broken out in a nearby warehouse or a tire workshop , the government said .
` ` According to what our people saw , there was an explosion followed immediately by flames , '' Daniel Karam , head of the Mexican agency responsible for health care and social security , said at a news conference in Hermosillo .
The city of about 700,000 people is located about 170 miles south of the border with the U.S. state of Arizona .
Calderon said he was rushing medical assistance to overwhelmed medical staff in Hermosillo , including air ambulances and specialists in reconstructive surgery .
` ` I have ordered the attorney general , along with local authorities ... to investigate <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">as soon as possible</TIMEX3> to find out exactly what happened and identify whoever may be responsible , ''
Calderon said in a speech during an event in the state of Quintana Roo .
More than 140 children were in the ABC day - care center when the fire broke out , Karam told reporters .
Karam said the center had passed its last government inspection in <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-05">May</TIMEX3> .
The previous death toll given by the government was 31 children , but four more died in the hospital overnight .
In addition , at least 40 more children remained hospitalized , authorities said .
About 20 were in ` ` extremely grave '' condition , some with burns covering more than 70 percent of their bodies , the government said .
Six adults also were hospitalized in less serious condition following the fire , authorities said .
At a government auditorium , parents waited silently for their children 's bodies to be turned over to them .
At least one child was being flown to the Shriners children 's hospital in Sacramento , California , which specializes in burns and has been consulting with Mexican doctors , the hospital said .
` ` Our burn team here has been working all night with the medical professionals in Mexico to triage these patients , on the phone , '' Shriners hospital spokeswoman Catherine Curran told Reuters .
