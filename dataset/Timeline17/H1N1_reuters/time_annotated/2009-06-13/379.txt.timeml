The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06-11">Thursday</TIMEX3> and advised governments to prepare for a long - term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus .
The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six - point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> is under way .
` ` With <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06-13">today</TIMEX3> 's announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer - term response .
Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION" value="PXM">some months</TIMEX3> , if not years , to come , '' WHO Director - General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters .
People aged 30 - 50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference .
The virus has killed 109 people in Mexico , where it was first detected in <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> before spreading to the rest of the world , prompting the Mexican government to temporarily shut schools and businesses in an effort to slow its spread .
Countries from Australia to Chile to the United States are reporting that the new swine flu virus is ` ` crowding out '' seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said .
For <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> the virus was ` ` pretty stable , ''
but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry .
