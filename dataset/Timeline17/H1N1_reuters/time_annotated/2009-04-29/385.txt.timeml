By Niu Shuping and Ken Wills Nevermind that the H1N1 ` ` swine '' flu , which has killed more than 150 people in Mexico , is not directly caused by pigs and has so far not led to any outbreaks among pigs .
Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork .
Nevermind that the influenza - A virus contains DNA from avian and human as well as swine H1N1 viruses , but unfortunately -LRB- for the pork industry -RRB- has been tagged as ` ` swine flu '' by global health authorities and therefore by the media .
The net result is that , amid the confusion and potential risks of appearing unprepared , at least six countries have decided to panic over pigs , imposing import bans on live pigs and pork products from Mexico and the United States .
Indeed , the country with the largest pig population in the world -- China -- is going full - bore on a perceived threat to the domestic pig industry .
China 's quaratine authority took immediate action by banning pork imports from Mexico as well as 3 states in the United States , vowing to destroy any pigs that arrived at its borders .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , in a meeting hosted by Premier Wen Jiabao , China 's cabinet worked out an 8 - point flu prevention strategy , including one to strengthen inspection to detect any outbreaks of swine flu among pigs and to strictly supervise trade of live pigs as well as some pig breeding areas .
Why all this attention to pigs ?
Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai said the possibility of the virus spreading to pigs can not be ruled out , although there was no mention that the avian portion of the virus 's DNA might also lead to an outbreak among poultry .
To be fair , screening of people arriving at China 's airports has also been stepped up , though so far no human cases of the flu have been announced in the country .
What is clear is that when the world 's most populous nation raises concerns about a staple food in the country 's diet , it most certainly will affect prices .
Early signs are that consumers have begun to avoid pork , much to the dismay of breeders and others in the industry .
In fact many farmers want to avoid publicity at all costs for fear that any further news coverage even to correct the misimpressions -- will hurt business .
The Beijing News on <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> reported that pork prices in the capital have dropped significantly .
It cited a pig breeder in a Beijing suburb , Li Wei , as saying he worries that consumers might shift to mutton or beef if the ` ` swine '' flu scare keeps spreading .
<TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2007">Two years ago</TIMEX3> , China 's pork industry was racked by blue ear disease , which decimated pig numbers and caused prices to spike skyward .

Since the start of the year , prices have been falling in response to subsidies Beijing offered to replenish supplies .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> they 're dipping faster , this time in part due to government efforts to protect the sector .
Hopefully , when we look back , the sudden <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> dip in pork prices will turn out to have been the worst of China 's casualties from the global flu scare .

REUTERS\/China Daily I think the Chinese government should act more tactfully in this politcal PR game .
You ban Mexican pork and flights , they already reprised tit - fot - tat in kind .

But if we as an integrated world community tender aid and relief to each other to irradicate such borderless virus , would n't we live with more mutual accommodation and less discrimination ?
Swine flu originates from humans , not pigs .
Never lay blame on ranch farmers .
They are already going broke .
I am in travel industry which is already battered by <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008">last year</TIMEX3> 's financial tsunami until <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Admittedly , this flu scare is over - exaggerated by mass media .
The USA records just one death , whereas its total flu deaths amount to more than 200,000 <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> is just another rock dropped on us in a trapped pit .
carrier and quarantine him merely because he presents a Mexican passport is simply ` ` racial profiling '' and is of course , downright discrimination which should be condemned by our civilized world .
