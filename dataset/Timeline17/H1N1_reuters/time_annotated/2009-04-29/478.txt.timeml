Reuters -RRB- - Using a new tracking tool , search engine giant Google said on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> it saw a spike in searches for information about flu among people in Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">last week</TIMEX3> even before news of the outbreak became widely known .
Google said it has put together a flu trends tracking system for Mexico based on the U.S. Google Flu tool launched <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-FA">last fall</TIMEX3> that is used by U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out where influenza is heating up .
It is based on Google 's observation that people who are sick with flu tend to search for the same types of information on the Internet , and these searches can be used to predict where an outbreak may be occurring .
` ` We have seen evidence in Mexico that Google users also search flu - related topics when they are experiencing flu - related symptoms , '' Jeremy Ginsberg , lead engineer for Flu Trends at Google , said in a telephone briefing .
Studies show that between 35 and 40 percent of all visits to the Internet are started by people looking for health information .
Ginsberg said the Mexican data have not been cross - checked with years of data on actual flu cases in Mexico like the U.S. flu tracker has , so the data may not be reliable .
But he said the company is optimistic that the system , which generates maps based on peaks in flu - related searches , ` ` may reflect actual flu activity . ''
` ` We did see a small increase in many parts of Mexico before major news coverage began <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">last week</TIMEX3> , '' he said .
Ginsberg said people search for different things when they are sick -- like the word thermometer -- than they do when they are looking for news about flu outbreaks .
Ginsberg said the group has also seen a spike in U.S.-related flu searches that correspond with increases in U.S. cases being reported .
He said the hope is that the tool might offer one more way to predict hot spots in an outbreak as they happen .
` ` If it spreads quickly , it may give public health officials the chance to respond quickly , '' he said .
