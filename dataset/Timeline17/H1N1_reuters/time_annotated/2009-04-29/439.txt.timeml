ROME | We d <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Apr 29 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2009-04-29T15:58">3:58 pm</TIMEX3> BST ROME -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy 's first family soap opera was back on the front pages <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's wife said his party 's selection of women to run in European elections was a ` ` shamelessly trashy '' process .
Veronica Berlusconi , who has publicly lamented her husband 's eye for younger women in the past , also accused him of going to the birthday bash of an 18 - year - old woman in Naples but not attending the coming - of - age - parties of his own children .
Veronica , 52 , who rarely appears with her husband , said she agreed with Italian newspapers ' descriptions of her husband 's party 's choice of female candidates as ` ` entertainment for the emperor , '' in what newspapers saw as a reference to him .
The latest public clash between the Berlusconis , which dominated mainstream newspaper front pages along with swine flu and Fiat 's rescue of Chrysler , follows a media debate over ` ` starlets in politics . ''
` ` Women in Politics -- Veronica 's Wrath , '' was the way La Stampa of Turin put it .
In an e - mail to Italian news agency Ansa , she praised politicians such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then added : ` ` But what 's happening <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">today</TIMEX3> -LRB- in Italy -RRB- behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave . ''
She added that it offended all women and particularly those who had fought in the ` ` frontline '' for women 's equality .
Her 72 - year - old husband , speaking to reporters during a trip to Warsaw , said he was sorry his wife had apparently believed ` ` what she read in the papers '' and added that it was all ` ` a campaign -LRB- against him -RRB- hyped by the leftist press . ''
The controversy exploded <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> when an on - line magazine close to Berlusconi 's main conservative ally , lower house speaker Gianfranco Fini , criticised how centre - right women candidates were being chosen for the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2008-06">June</TIMEX3> European elections .
That article , seen by some media as a reference to Berlusconi 's party , said women politicians could not be used like ` ` pieces of costume jewellery '' to attract votes .
Berlusconi 's People of Freedom party is considering a number of former actresses and television personalities as possible candidates in the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> European election , media reports say .
As party leader , he has a powerful voice in who makes the list .
` ` Some have written that it is all part of entertainment for the emperor .
I agree , '' Veronica said .
` ` What is emerging from newspapers is shamelessly trashy , all in the name of power . ''
Berlusconi told reporters in Warsaw it was ` ` absurd '' that women who speak several languages and have several degrees should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business .
Veronica Berlusconi also took her husband to task for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> dropping in at the birthday party in Naples of an 18 - year - old woman whose father is a political acquaintance .
` ` That surprised me very much too , '' Veronica said , ` ` Even because he never came to the 18th birthday parties of his children , even though he was invited . ''
Berlusconi has three children with Veronica and two by his first marriage .
He has been in hot water with her several times in the past in a very public way .
<TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">Two years ago</TIMEX3> , she criticised him for flirting with young starlets at a party .
He later issued a syrupy public apology in the press , saying : ` ` I beg you to forgive me . ''
