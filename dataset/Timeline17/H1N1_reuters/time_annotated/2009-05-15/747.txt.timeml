The new flu strain that emerged in Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-04">last month</TIMEX3> has brought Japanese TV shows , newspapers and government ads out in a rash of demonstration s of the art of proper hand - washing to avoid the spread of germs .
` ` First , you clean the palms , then rub the dirt off the back of the hands .
Make sure you wash between fingers and finger tips .

And yes , do n't forget your thumbs and wrists ! ! ''
Even for the Japanese , who wear flu and hay fever masks by the million , sometimes when they 're not even sick , washing hands thoroughly for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="PT15S" mod="EQUAL_OR_MORE">at least 15 seconds</TIMEX3> requires extra effort , as not many of us are well - versed in proper thumb - washing techniques .
The government also has a ` ` cough etiquette '' campaign calling on people to cover their mouths with a tissue when in the act , adding the rather obvious need to face away from other people .
The guideline says post - cough dirty tissues must be thrown away immediately , although it does n't say where - a slight drawback in a country that is occasionaly trashcan - challenged .
Japan reported its first confirmed cases of the new flu <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has four patients , detected at Narita international Airport and sent directly to a hospital nearby to limit the spread of H1N1 .
The government continues to have health officials board planes from Mexico , the United States and Canada to check passengers , including using portable thermal sensors to find people with fever .
A Reuters colleague went through on - board medical checks lasting <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="PT1H" mod="MORE_THAN">more than one hour</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-W19">last week</TIMEX3> .
` ` In the U.S. , everything was more relaxed , '' she told me the other day .
` ` Some people were getting irritated by the wait on the plane but no one was angry .
As we had to wait for all passengers to be inspected , a flight attendant announced results of the NBA playoffs to take our minds off our frustration . ''
Handed a mask to wear when leaving the plane , she got a call <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">a few days later</TIMEX3> from a local public health center that took down her contact numbers , travel history and health conditions after the flight .
Despite these efforts , it seems like it 's just a matter of time before the disease spreads around the country , whether or not we wash our hands and cough correctly .

Before moving to my <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> position , I specialised in Japan 's economic policy and macroeconomic news for <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="APPROX">about 10 years</TIMEX3> , with a concentration in reporting daily policy developments at Ministry of Finance , the Bank of Japan and other economic agencies .
