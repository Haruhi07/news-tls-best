The other fatalities have been in the United States , where 10 people have died , and Costa Rica and Canada which have reported one death each .
The WHO said that the airborne virus has <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> been detected in all regions of the world except for Africa , which has yet to report an H1N1 infection .
The biggest pockets outside of North America so far are in Japan , Britain and Spain .
There has been one case confirmed in Taiwan , a self - ruled island claimed by China that is not a WHO member .
