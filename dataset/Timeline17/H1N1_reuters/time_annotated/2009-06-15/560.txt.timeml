NEW YORK | Mon <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">Jun 15 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME" value="2009-06-15T19:05">7:05 pm</TIMEX3> EDT NEW YORK -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co -LRB- JPM .
N -RRB- and a group of hedge funds could wind up with the lion 's share of Six Flags Inc SIXF .
OB if a proposal by the theme park operator is approved in bankruptcy court .
In a securities filing <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">Monday</TIMEX3> , Six Flags said it would give secured lenders a 92 percent equity stake in the company .
They will also own $ 600 million of the company 's debt .
That leaves the company 's unsecured creditors with just 8 percent of the company -- a markedly different stake than was previously outlined in an out - of - court plan .
Talks with bondholders started <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2008" mod="END">late last year</TIMEX3> , but hit a number of roadblocks along the way .
` ` By the bondholders dragging it out with us over <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DURATION" value="P6M">the six months</TIMEX3> , your business takes on more uncertainty , you get more risk factors and you find yourself having to do a bank deal , '' said Chief Executive Mark Shapiro in an interview with Reuters .
Shapiro said he hoped the company would emerge from bankruptcy in <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> , healthier with significantly less debt .
Under an out - of - court plan in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> , one class of unsecured creditors was to get an 85 percent stake in the company .
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> plan , that class would get a mere 1 percent .
Another class of unsecured creditors would get 7 percent .
` ` If the bank lenders can get the plan through as <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> contemplated , that will be an extraordinary deal for them , '' said CRT Capital Group analyst Joseph Stauff .

A spate of interest payments and the H1N1 flu virus were among the factors that constrained Six Flags ' liquidity and drove the company into the arms of the bank lenders , Shapiro said .
Six Flags was also facing a $ 300 million payment to preferred stock holders due in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2008-08">August</TIMEX3> that it said it could not pay .
Shapiro said filing in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> versus <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-08">August</TIMEX3> saved the company between $ 45 million and $ 50 million in interest payments .
Six Flags has not posted an annual profit since <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , but drew more than $ 1 billion in revenue in <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> .
New York - based Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="TIME" value="2009-06-13TMO">Saturday morning</TIMEX3> , a move that was widely expected by analysts and industry experts .
The filing followed a failed attempt to convert debt to equity .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-06-13">Saturday</TIMEX3> , the company said its restructuring plan had been unanimously approved by its steering committee , which includes firms like Silver Point Capital and Eaton Vance Management .
But many experts said the bankruptcy proceedings will likely be bumpy , as unsecured creditors try to get a larger piece of the pie .
This group includes bondholders represented by the Bank of New York Mellon Corp -LRB- BK .
N -RRB- and the Lake County , Illinois Convention and Visitor 's Bureau , which is owed more than $ 180,000 .
` ` The unsecured holders would get far less recovery than they would have expected , '' said Christopher Snow , an analyst with CreditSights .
` ` The management team put forth a plan that arguably serves to benefit the management and secured lenders at the expense of the unsecured lenders . ''
On <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">Monday</TIMEX3> , one creditor , Avenue Capital Management LLC filed an objection to , among other things , Six Flags ' use of cash collateral .
Shapiro had no comment on the objection .
Analysts expect the company 's management to survive the Chapter 11 proceedings .
` ` Since the bankruptcy is the result of capital structure issues rather than operating issues , it 's likely that the existing management will stay , '' said Mike Simonton , a credit analyst with Fitch .
Much of the company 's $ 2.4 billion debt load was amassed from <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2005">2005</TIMEX3> , when the company bought parks and built roller coaster rides .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> management team was installed by Washington Redskins football team owner Daniel Snyder , who will continue as Six Flags ' chairman .
