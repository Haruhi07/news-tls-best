The first H1N1 infection found to be resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu represents an isolated case with no <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> implications for public health , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-06-30">Tuesday</TIMEX3> .
The United Nations agency has declared a global pandemic is underway from the virus known as swine flu which has so far been treatable with Tamiflu , made by Roche .
WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said that the discovery of a patient in Denmark whose infection did not respond to the drug , revealed by the Swiss company and Danish officials on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> , did not amplify the severity of the virus .
` ` This is an isolated case .
At this time , there is no public health implication .
But we must remain alert as the virus can change at any time and we must not be complacent , '' he told Reuters .
Officials say the patient is <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> well and no further contagion with the resistant virus was detected .
Resistance to Tamiflu has been previously documented in the deadly bird flu virus H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 flu , Thompson said .
` ` We need to monitor the virus -LRB-
H1N1 -RRB- continuously , '' he said , adding that the WHO 's global influenza surveillance network linking laboratories in 97 countries would keep monitoring it .
` ` WHO is not changing its recommendations for the use of antivirals , '' Thompson added , referring to the global body 's advice to its 193 member states .

The WHO has previously said that the H1N1 virus is sensitive to a class of antiviral drugs which includes Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , and Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline , known generically as zanamivir .
Denmark 's State Serum Institute said , when making the announcement on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> , that it was expected that the strain would at some point show resistance to Tamiflu .
It said that while the patient was found to be infected with a virus strain that had mutated to a form resistant to Tamiflu , the alternative drug Relenza , which is inhaled , remained an effective treatment .
The WHO on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-06-11">June 11</TIMEX3> raised its pandemic flu alert to its highest level of 6 , signifying that the first influenza pandemic since <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> was under way -LRB- ID : nLC321991 -RRB- Flu viruses mutate regularly and can develop resistance to drugs at any time .

The WHO has said Tamiflu was working against strains of the new H1N1 flu but some health experts have expressed concern that it might be less effective than Relenza , since there have been widespread reports in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008">the past year</TIMEX3> of resistance to Tamiflu by seasonal H1N1 flu , a distant cousin of the new swine flu virus .
David Daigle , a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that the isolated case in Denmark did not merit a change in the recommended use of Tamiflu .
` ` The resistance has not changed the capability of the virus to transmit or cause disease , and the assessment is still that this is a relatively mild influenza , '' he said on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> .
At least 20 companies make flu vaccines , including Novartis , Sanofi - Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Solvay , Australia 's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> part of AstraZeneca .
French drugmaker Sanofi - Aventis , which has estimated it makes 40 percent of the world 's supply of flu vaccine , said <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-06">this month</TIMEX3> that it had begun large - scale production of a H1N1 vaccine through its Sanofi - Pasteur unit .
Novartis has said it expects a vaccine to be available by <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">autumn</TIMEX3> and Baxter International has said it is in full - scale production of a vaccine that could be ready for commercial use as early as <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-07">July</TIMEX3> .
