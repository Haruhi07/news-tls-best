Swine flu followed route map By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Tue <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2009-06-30">Jun 30 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME" value="2009-06-30T04:18">4:18 am</TIMEX3> IST WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - Health experts are fond of saying any new disease is just a flight away from anywhere , and a report published on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> shows the new strain of H1N1 flu followed the airline route map as it spread around the globe .
The swine flu virus spread first and quickest in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> in the United States and Canada -- where 80 percent of airline passengers traveled in <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April of 2008</TIMEX3> , researchers at St. Michael 's Hospital in Toronto found .
Dr. Kamram Khan of St. Michael 's and colleagues used International Air Transport Association data for their study .
They said travel patterns were also similar in <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> and therefore likely to be similar in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> .
` ` This work provides the world with a potent early warning system for emerging infectious diseases , '' Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion said in a statement .
` ` Our analysis showed that in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2008-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April 2008</TIMEX3> , a total of 2.35 million passengers flew from Mexico to 1,018 cities in 164 countries , '' Khan and colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine and published at h1n1 .
Los Angeles had the most travelers , with 221,494 passengers arriving from Mexico in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2009-03">March</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April of 2008</TIMEX3> .
New York followed with 126,345 .
The first non - U.S. city was Toronto , No . 12 , with 44,854 passengers arriving from Mexico .
The World Health Organization has confirmed 70,893 cases of the new H1N1 swine flu pandemic , with 311 deaths .
However , U.S. health officials <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="2009-W26">last week</TIMEX3> said there were likely at least 1 million cases there alone .
Iraq , Lithuania , Monaco and Nepal all confirmed their first cases on <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009-06-29">Monday</TIMEX3> .
The first cases were detected in two California children in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> , but tests showed the first known infections were in Mexico .
By the time they had identified a new virus , U.S. officials said it had spread too far and too fast to try to stop it .
Other countries tried measures to slow its spread , but WHO declared a pandemic -- a global epidemic -- <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009-06">this month</TIMEX3> .
` ` For the first time , we can quickly integrate information about worldwide air traffic patterns with information about global infectious disease threats , '' Khan said .
` ` What this means is that cities and countries around the world can <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> respond to news of a threat earlier and more intelligently than ever before . ''
The researchers said the United States receives more than 76 million international visitors from around the world <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> and the United States and Canada together generate and receive about one - sixth of the global volume of international air traffic .
