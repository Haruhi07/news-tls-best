Reuters -RRB- - Pharmacists in the United Arab Emirates have ignored regulations on the sale of Tamiflu to satisfy ` ` panic '' demand for the drug following a flu outbreak .
` ` We ran out of stock <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="APPROX">about a week ago</TIMEX3> .
When the news came out about the cases in Mexico we had people flooding into the pharmacy asking for Tamiflu , '' one pharmacist said .
Tamiflu is one of the medicines recognized by the World Health Organization as effective in treating the H1N1 flu that has spread across the world after an outbreak in Mexico .
Ali Al - Marzouki , director of public health affairs in the UAE emirate of Dubai , said pharmacies had been reminded that Tamiflu should be sold only on prescription .
` ` We have to protect the stocks that we have <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> and we can not allow people 's panic to eat through our supplies , '' he said .
` ` There is no reason for people to panic , the UAE is safe . ''
Pharmacies are selling a box of Tamiflu with 10 tablets meant to last <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DURATION" value="P5D">five days</TIMEX3> for around 180 dirhams -LRB- $ 49 -RRB- .
New stocks of Tamiflu and face masks are expected in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> , the pharmacist said .
<TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-05-04">Monday</TIMEX3> , the World Heath Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said its laboratories have identified a total of 985 H1N1 flu infections in 20 countries , including 590 people infected in Mexico and 226 people in the United States .
Marzouki said Dubai alone has 1 million Tamiflu capsules , imported <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2005">four years ago</TIMEX3> during the avian flu outbreak .
The UAE , most of whose population of 4.5 million are foreigners , is a commerce and tourism hub which has a large number of travelers transiting through its airports .
` ` The reason I want to buy Tamiflu is because I 'll be traveling to New York in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P2D">two days</TIMEX3> and I ' m worried about the situation there , '' said a French businessman based in Dubai .
