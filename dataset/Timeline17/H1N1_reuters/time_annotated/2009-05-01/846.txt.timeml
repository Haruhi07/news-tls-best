Reuters -RRB- - Humans have it .
At least not yet , and U.S. pork producers are doing everything they can to make sure that the new H1N1 virus , known around the world as the ` ` swine flu , '' stays out of their herds .
` ` That is the biggest concern , that your herd could somehow contract this illness from an infected person , '' said Kansas hog farmer Ron Suther , who is banning visitors from his sow barns and requiring maintenance workers , delivery men and other strangers to report on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> travels and any illness before they step foot on his property .
` ` If a person is sick , we do n't want you coming anywhere on the farm , '' Suther said .
Those sentiments were echoed by producers around the nation <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">this week</TIMEX3> as fears of a possible global flu pandemic grew , with more than 200 people sickened , including more than 100 in the United States , and at least 177 dead , all but one in Mexico .
` ` There is no evidence of this new strain being in our pig populations in the United States .

And our concern very much is we do n't want a sick human to come into our barns and transmit this new virus to our pigs , '' said National Pork Producers chief veterinarian Jennifer Greiner .
` ` If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs .
We do n't have antivirals .
We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , '' said Greiner .
The World Health Organization on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> officially declared it would stop calling the new strain of flu ` ` swine flu , '' because no pigs in any country have been determined to have the illness and the origination of the strain has not been determined .
The never - before - seen H1N1 flu virus has elements of swine , avian and human varieties .
Still , U.S. hog farmers said flu fears have hit them hard in the wallet as hog prices plummeted <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">this week</TIMEX3> in response .
Many countries reacted to the outbreak <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-W18" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> by banning pork or meat from U.S. states that have human cases of the flu .
And Egypt ordered the slaughter of all pigs in the country as a precaution .
U.S. hog producers have already been struggling financially for <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="P1Y" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a year</TIMEX3> due to poor prices and high feed costs .
If the new flu strain does hit their herds , it could spur further price declines , and could potentially spread broadly through herds .
To try to protect against such a scenario , industry groups and veterinarians <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">this week</TIMEX3> warned farmers to step up their biosafety protocols , keeping pigs in barns behind security fences with access by any outsiders extremely limited .
Purdue University veterinarian Sandy Amass said farmers should keep an eye on pigs for ` ` coughing , runny nose , fever and a reduction in feed intake , '' and to have the animals tested immediately if they exhibit such flu symptoms .
` ` Pigs get flu just like people get flu , '' Amass said .
` ` We 're want to do everything possible so the pigs do n't get infected . ''
For Carroll , Iowa , producer Craig Rowles that means if any of his workers feel sick , they are ordered to take time off work -- paid -- to keep them away from the pigs .
` ` It 's a real issue , '' Rowles said .
` ` If the pigs get it , there is n't much we can do .
Water , aspirin , and bed rest , that 's all we ' ve got . ''
