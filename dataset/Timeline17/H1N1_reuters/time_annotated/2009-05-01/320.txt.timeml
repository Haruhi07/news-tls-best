The new virus that has killed as many as 177 people and spread globally is a mongrel that appears to have mixed with another hybrid virus containing swine , bird and human bits , U.S. researchers reported on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
Raul Rabadan and colleagues at Columbia University in New York analyzed the published genetic sequences from the H1N1 virus that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic .
` ` The closest relatives to the virus we have found are swine viruses , '' Rabadan said in a telephone interview .
` ` Six segments of the virus are related to swine viruses from North America and the other two from swine viruses isolated in Europe\/Asia , '' they wrote in the online journal Eurosurveillance .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-W17">last week</TIMEX3> after discovering this virus in two U.S. children that it had four virus types -- two swine , an avian and a human component .
It may be even more complex than that .
Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once .
Rabadan 's team said this particular strain looked partly like another hybrid , or what scientists call a reassortant , virus .
` ` The North American ancestors are related to the multiple reassortants , H1N2 and H3N2 swine viruses isolated in North America since <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> , '' they wrote .
` ` In particular , the swine H3N2 isolates from <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1998">1998</TIMEX3> were a triple reassortment of human , swine and avian origin . ''
Scientists can study those genetics to try to track the origin of the new virus .
Mexican officials have denied it came from pigs in Mexico and pork producers have been battling rumors it could have come from pig farms there .
Rabadan said the findings did not show the virus came directly from pigs .
` ` We do n't know how long this virus has been in humans , '' he said .
Many different influenza strains are circulating at any given time and pandemic strains -- the ones that cause global outbreaks from a whole new strain -- are believed to have come from animals .
` ` We know that with the two pandemics in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> they were coming from a mixture of human and avian viruses , '' Rabadan said .
The H1N1 strain that caused the far more serious <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic appears to have been virtually a pure avian strain , according to published analyses .
