At the world famous Florida theme park , which is run by Walt Disney Co and visited by millions <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> , enthusiastic crowds filled the avenues and rides , apparently unworried by the warnings of a possible pandemic of a new strain of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus .
The United States has declared a health emergency and in Mexico , where up to 176 people have died following the outbreak there of the virus originally termed ` ` swine flu , '' the government has ordered a five - day partial shutdown of nonessential government offices and businesses .
The Mexican Health Ministry also warned people against touching or kissing while greeting each other .
Authorities in the United States , who have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections but only one death , are recommending that people sick with flu symptoms seek treatment and stay home .
Florida is testing a number of suspected cases .
At the Magic Kingdom on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> , one mother pressed her baby 's face into the costumed character Pluto 's furry snout for a kiss .
Other youngsters continued to snuggle up to various other Disney characters and share ` ` high - fives , '' while fidgety kids slid their hands along the rope lines while waiting to get on the rides .
Among the crowds were the Jansens from Amsterdam in the Netherlands .
They said they were not worried about bringing their 2 - year - old and 7 - year - old children to the Magic Kingdom .
` ` There 's no concern for us .
We always go to the big public places with the kids , '' said Ed Jansen .
` ` Just like any Dutch man or Dutch woman , we have both feet on the floor .
We 're not a panicked people . ''
Coordinating the international campaign against the new flu virus , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- has its <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> alert level just one notch below a full pandemic .
Despite some official fears that crowded venues could increase contagion risk , there were no visible extraordinary precautionary measures in place at Disney 's Magic Kingdom .
Trash sweepers , as usual , swept up bits of garbage almost before they touched ground , but they did not appear to be doing any extra disinfecting or unusual cleaning .
The Walt Disney Co. has maintained a tight - lipped stance about the flu alert , wary of any news that could trouble its carefully crafted guest experience at the world 's largest theme park .
Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger in Orlando told Reuters <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">this week</TIMEX3> , ` ` We 're not really talking about it , '' declining to say whether any special health measures were being taken .
Disney World representatives held a closed - door meeting with public health leaders on <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">Thursday</TIMEX3> in Orlando to discuss the flu alert .
After the meeting with Orange County Health Director Dr. Kevin Sherin , Disney representative Mike Griffin told local media the company was ` ` monitoring the situation . ''
Sherin and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty said they had full confidence in Disney 's contingency plans in the event of a health emergency , but they gave no details .
` ` We truly have world class theme parks in Orange County and Osceola County , '' Sherin said , referring to Disney World , Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando .
` ` These are the best in the world .
The practices they have to protect cast members and staff and guests are second to none . ''
Universal Orlando is co - owned by the Blackstone Group and NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric Co. .
Most visitors seemed determined not to let the alarm over the spreading flu virus spoil their family fun .
` ` We come from a tropical island and we have many kinds of fevers , '' said Puerto Rican retiree Luis Larregoity and his wife Miriam Cruz .
Ann Genthner , a grandmother from Boston visiting the Magic Kingdom with her daughter - in - law and two grandchildren , said she had n't bothered to follow the news about the flu .
` ` I thought about it , but it did n't affect me in any way , '' Genthner said .
