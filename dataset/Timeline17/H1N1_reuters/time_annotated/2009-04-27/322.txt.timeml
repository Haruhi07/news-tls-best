-LRB- Repeats to more subscribers without changes in text -RRB- SINGAPORE , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">April 27</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As fears grow about whether a new dangerous strain of swine flu will develop into a global pandemic and affect economies , Asia can look to the <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> SARS epidemic for pointers on what might happen .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , Asia was feeling the effects of the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2002-10">October 2002</TIMEX3> Bali bombings , a tentative world recovery was underway from the bursting of the technology bubble and there was conflict in Iraq .
Likewise <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">today</TIMEX3> , other factors , such as job and income losses from the credit crisis , could make it difficult to isolate the effects of any swine flu outbreak .

But SARS provides the last main point of reference in how the world dealt with a pandemic that was spread by human - to - human contact and how it affected economies and markets .
Here are some questions and answers about the severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , crisis : WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF SARS ON ASIA ?
The World Health Organisation declared SARS a pandemic in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> .
By <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2003-06">June of that year</TIMEX3> , it had lifted an advisory warning against traveling to SARS affected countries .
There were some 8,000 cases and close to 800 deaths .
The most visible impact of SARS was on tourism and consumption patterns in the most affected countries : Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Malaysia , although others in the region also suffered .
Singapore and Hong Kong slipped into recession in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> .
Other countries affected by SARS included Canada , South Africa , Sweden , France and the United States .
Deaths were reported in Asia , Canada , France and South Africa .
According to the Asian Development Bank , the cost of SARS in terms of lost GDP in nominal terms for East and Southeast Asia was about $ 18 billion or 0.6 percentage points of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> GDP .
The main channels through which SARS affected economies was through tourist arrivals .
ADB data shows a 20 - 70 percent drop on tourist arrivals in <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2003-04">April 2003</TIMEX3> in the most affected economies , while others in Asia also saw declines of 15 - 35 percent , leading to estimated tourism revenue losses of nearly $ 15 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP .
SARS - affected economies experienced drops in retail sales growth in the order of 5 - 10 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="2003" mod="START">early 2003</TIMEX3> .
Hong Kong 's economy shrank 2.6 percent and Singapore 's by 2 percent in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2003-H1">the first half of 2003</TIMEX3> .
Overall growth was ironically helped by a simultaneous decline in imports and investment .
HOW DID MARKETS REACT TO SARS ?
Market reaction was relatively muted , possibly because the panic over SARS lasted for just about one quarter and governments reacted quickly .
The Singapore dollar SGD = fell nearly 4 percent against the U.S. dollar between <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="2003-01" mod="END">the end of January 2003</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2003-04" mod="END">the end of April 2003</TIMEX3> , but it then rallied .
MCSI 's emerging Asia - ex - Japan index .
MIAPJ0000PUS fell around 14 percent between <TIMEX3 tid="t42" type="DATE" value="2003-01">January</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2003-03">March 2003</TIMEX3> .
From <TIMEX3 tid="t44" type="DATE" value="2009-03" mod="END">the end of March</TIMEX3> it rallied by 56 percent during the rest of the year Hong Kong 's benchmark index .
HSI shed 18 percent of its value between <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DATE" value="2002-12">December 2002</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DATE" value="2003-04">April 2003</TIMEX3> , bottoming at a 4 - year low .
For a graphic on economic and market impact , click here : China had price controls for SARS - related drugs , tax waivers for affected industries such as hotels , interest subsidies for tourism sectors .
Hong Kong 's government announced a package of measures worth around 1 percent of GDP , which included tax reductions and loan guarantees .
Singapore likewise had a SARS relief package including measures for airlines .
It also eased monetary policy in <TIMEX3 tid="t53" type="DATE" value="2003-07">July 2003</TIMEX3> by a one - off devaluation of the currency .
Malaysia 's package was close to 2 percent of GDP and included cheaper loans , support for job training and tourism sectors .
IS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION DIFFERENT NOW ?

The starting point for most economies is much lower , since the credit crisis has already plunged a lot of the developed world and countries such as Singapore , Japan and Hong Kong into recession .
Tourism received a big boost between <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DATE" value="2004">2004</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> and is <TIMEX3 tid="t56" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> a much bigger contributor to growth , with revenues comprising between 6 and 9 percent of GDP in Hong Kong , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore .
