Reuters -RRB- - Fears of a global flu pandemic grew as new suspected cases of a dangerous new strain of swine flu appeared around the world .
It has killed up to 81 people in Mexico and spread to the United States and Canada .
Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak : HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ?
HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ?
All the fatalities have been in Mexico , where the government is reporting at least 20 and up to 81 deaths from the flu virus .
Most of the dead are between 25 and 45 -- the age group past pandemics have tended to strike .
Mexican officials said , however , that most of the 1,300 suspected cases were found not to have swine flu .
In the United States , the flu has infected 20 people in California , Kansas , Texas , New York and Ohio .
Canada has confirmed six cases .
Possible infections have also been detected in Spain , France and New Zealand .
WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ?
The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person .
It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
It is passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus from their hands .
It likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organisation have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork .
The Geneva - based WHO has declared the flu a ` ` public health emergency of international concern . ''
It poses the biggest risk of a large - scale pandemic since avian flu re - emerged in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2003">2003</TIMEX3> , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries .
The Mexican government is stressing that it can be treated and it has one million doses of antiviral drugs .
HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ?
The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhoea .
Common seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , often targeting the elderly .
Most people die from pneumonia and flu can kill previously healthy people for reasons no one quite understands .
It can also worsen bacterial infections .
New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop .
This new strain of swine flu is genetically different from the H1N1 virus that the seasonal flu vaccine protects against .
HOW BAD COULD IT GET ?

A <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> a ` ` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about one million people globally .
In a <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> ` ` Spanish '' flu pandemic between 40 million and 100 million people died .
However , the WHO says the world is <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic .
WHAT MEASURES IS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TAKING ?
Mexico has closed all schools in the capital and two central states until <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-05-06">May 6</TIMEX3> and stopped hundreds of public events in Mexico City , including concerts .
Mexico City has shut 70 percent of its bars and nightclubs , closed churches and cinemas , and the army is handing out surgical face masks on the street .
The government is recommending people avoid crowded places and refrain from greetings like shaking hands , kissing or hugging .
People have been told to wash their hands frequently and avoid sharing food or kitchenware .
It has also issued an emergency decree that gives it the power to isolate sick people , enter homes or workplaces and regulate air , sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection .
The government has even extended the deadline on filing tax returns by <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a month</TIMEX3> to <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2008-05" mod="END">the end of May</TIMEX3> .
WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING TO HELP ?
The U.S. government is monitoring developments and the CDC and the WHO are working on a vaccine .

The WHO has activated a command and control center for acute public health events nicknamed the ` ` war room . ''
It says it is ready to use rapid containment measures if needed , including antivirals .
The WHO has a stockpile of 5 million treatment courses of the antiviral Tamiflu , by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , and of Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , which have both proven effective against the virus .
Countries and regions also have antiviral supplies and the United States has released 25 percent of its 50 - million course stockpile of the two drugs .
SHOULD TOURISTS WITH TRIPS PLANNED TO MEXICO BE WORRIED ?
The CDC and the WHO say there is no need to alter travel plans and Mexico has said it saw no need to close its borders .
