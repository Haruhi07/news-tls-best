Biotechnology Company , Replikins Ltd. , Provided Advance Warning of Mexican H1N1 ` Swine ... \ * Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release .
The company was able to state the likelihood of H1N1 outbreaks based on its patented Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- genomics technology , which examines specific regions in virus genes which have been linked with past epidemics .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April 2008</TIMEX3> announcement , attached below as published on the Web , stated that in H1N1 the company had then detected the highest concentrations of these specific regions ever seen , except for those from the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic which killed millions of people .
<TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">Today</TIMEX3> , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics .
A synthetic H1N1 Replikins Vaccine is available for testing .
A similar synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to successfully block the entry of H5N1 virus into , replication in , and excretion from chickens .
The company is able to produce these vaccines in as little as <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION" value="P7D">7 days</TIMEX3> , rather than the <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="PXM">many months</TIMEX3> needed for traditional vaccines , because they are synthesized at the peptide level .
The following is the text of the <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April 2008</TIMEX3> release in which Replikins was able to pinpoint the high risk of H1N1 outbreaks : -- H1N1 Influenza Virus with Highest Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB-
Since the <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> Pandemic Identified in the U.S. and Austria Boston , MA -LRB- PRWeb -RRB- <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-04-07">April 7 , 2008</TIMEX3> -- Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> increased to 7.6 -LRB-
plus\/minus 1.4 -RRB- , its highest level since the <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> H1N1 pandemic -LRB-
p value less than 0.001 -RRB- .
A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of the specific strain .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of H3N2 , for instance .
The <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the U.S. and Austria .
It may succeed H5N1 as the leading candidate for the next expected overdue pandemic .
However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast -LRB- R -RRB- software in all three previous pandemics , namely <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> H1N1 , <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="1957">1957</TIMEX3> H2N2 , and <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 , have not yet been detected in the <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> evolving H1N1 .
There is evidence that many factors , including virus structure , host receptivity , and the environment , together with infectivity and rapid replication , need to converge for a pandemic to occur .
For H5N1 , the high human mortality rate , which peaked at over 80 % in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2006">2006</TIMEX3> - <TIMEX3 tid="t29" type="DATE" value="2007">07</TIMEX3> in Indonesia , as well as <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> low infectivity , both appear to limit H5N1 's ability to produce a pandemic .
Furthermore , the H5N1 rapid replication cycle which began in <TIMEX3 tid="t31" type="DATE" value="1996">1996</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> appears to be over .
The H5N1 virus produced less than 300 World Health Organization confirmed deaths <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P10Y" mod="MORE_THAN">over the past 10 years</TIMEX3> .
On the other hand , H1N1 , with an estimated human mortality rate of only 2.5 to 10 % , but with much higher infectivity , produced an estimated 50 million deaths in the <TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic .
A number of countermeasures exist <TIMEX3 tid="t38" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">today</TIMEX3> which did not exist in <TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> , however .
Among these is Replikins ' ability to manufacture synthetic vaccines based on <TIMEX3 tid="t39" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> sequences , with a <TIMEX3 tid="t40" type="DURATION" value="P7D">seven day</TIMEX3> production turnaround .
-LRB- end of 4\/<TIMEX3 tid="t41" type="DATE" value="2008">2008</TIMEX3> release -RRB-
In the <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2008-04">April 2008</TIMEX3> announcement above , as published on the Web , Replikins stated that it had detected the highest levels of its specific genome regions ever seen in any virus samples , except for those from the <TIMEX3 tid="t43" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> pandemic which killed tens of millions of people .
<TIMEX3 tid="t46" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">Today</TIMEX3> , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics .
