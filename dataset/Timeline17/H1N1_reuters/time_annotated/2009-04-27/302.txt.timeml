By Tim Hepher and Karen Jacobs PARIS\/ATLANTA , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">April 27</TIMEX3> -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Panicked sellers fled investments in air , land and sea on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">Monday</TIMEX3> as fears of a flu pandemic rekindled memories of the Asian SARS crisis that caused widespread industry turmoil <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2003">six years ago</TIMEX3> .
From Sydney to New York , selling hit the world 's leading airline brands , hotels and cruise operators and the cost of insuring airline debt rose following the outbreak of swine flu .
The United States declared a public health emergency and Americans and Europeans were urged to avoid non - essential travel to Mexico , where 103 people have died from the outbreak .
Investors wiped $ 5 billion off the value of leading U.S. airlines in just <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT10M">10 minutes</TIMEX3> of trading , with all of the carriers most heavily exposed to Mexico racking up double - digit losses .
N , which offers more seats than any foreign airline into and out of Mexico , according to data provided exclusively to Reuters by airline schedules consultancy Innovata , saw its stock fall by 15 percent .
American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR .

MC , which offers the most capacity to Spanish - speaking Mexico from Europe , gave up 7 percent .
Airlines have lurched from crisis to crisis in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2008">the past year</TIMEX3> as carriers grappled with high oil prices , then the credit crunch , a slump in business travel and plunging cargo trade .
Some executives have been tentatively predicting relief from months of weak traffic figures and eying benefits from cost cuts including more than 25,000 job cuts in the United States .

But Helane Becker , a transportation analyst with Jesup & Lamont in New York , said the flu scare could stall any recovery .
` ` In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2002-SU">the summer of 2002</TIMEX3> , international airline traffic was down 14 - 15 percent so we would expect something similar , and we would expect any recovery to be pushed from <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2008-Q3">the third quarter</TIMEX3> of ' 09 into <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2008-Q4">the fourth quarter</TIMEX3> of ' 09 and <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2010">2010</TIMEX3> , '' Becker said .
The SARS epidemic broke out in <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2003" mod="START">early 2003</TIMEX3> , postponing a recovery from recession worsened by the <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2001-09-11">Sept 11 , 2001</TIMEX3> , attacks .
However its economic impact was mostly confined to one quarter .
In Hong Kong , Cathay Pacific Airways -LRB- 0293 .
HK -RRB- -- which at one point considered grounding its fleet during the SARS crisis -- lost 8 percent and Air China -LRB- 0753 .
HK -RRB- fell 13.5 percent .
SE said it had taken steps to ensure lessons learned from SARS were used to try to contain the scare .
It said cabin crew would try to spot unwell passengers .
` ` We have standard operating procedures in place based on the experience gained from handling the SARS outbreak .
Staff have been briefed on the nature of the disease and are on the alert for customers who appear unwell , '' a Singapore spokeswoman said .
` ` As the situation for <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> is primarily precautionary , there are no plans to disinfect our aircraft or for our cabin crew to wear masks .
However , we do carry emergency packs . ''
American Airlines reassured travellers it was prepared to deal with any type of illness on board a flight and that it had full ground - to - air communication with its medical staff .
It said it would allow passengers to any city in Mexico to change their plans without any fee or penalty , but there were no immediate reports of any airlines canceling flights .

` ` The one thing about airlines is they recover from events like this amazingly quickly .
It is damaging and unhelpful , but not the end of the world for them , '' he said .
