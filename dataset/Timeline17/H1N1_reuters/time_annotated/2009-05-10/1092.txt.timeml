By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Sun <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-05-10">May 10 , 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="TIME" value="2009-05-10T14:51">2:51 pm</TIMEX3> EDT WASHINGTON -LRB-
Reuters -RRB- - A Washington state man with H1N1 influenza died <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">last week</TIMEX3> , health officials said , the third U.S. sufferer to die as the new flu strain confirmed in more than 2,200 Americans appeared in Japan and Australia .
Health officials have warned that the true number of cases may be underestimated .
Although most cases appear to be mild , the new swine flu strain has killed just as seasonal flu does .
Another 48 people have died in Mexico and one each in Canada and Costa Rica .
Washington state officials said on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-09">Saturday</TIMEX3> a man in his 30s with underlying heart conditions died <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">last week</TIMEX3> , state governor Chris Gregoire describing his death as ` ` a sobering reminder that influenza is serious . ''
The virus has moved into the southern hemisphere , where influenza season is just beginning , and could mix with circulating seasonal flu viruses or the H5N1 avian influenza virus to create new strains , health officials said .
` ` One of the big challenges with influenza viruses is the way that they change , the way they combine and their prevalence in a number of species , '' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a news briefing on <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-05-09">Saturday</TIMEX3> .
` ` This is why it is so important for countries to have a strong capacity to deal with influenza and also why it is very important to understand what happens at the interface between people and animals . ''
Before the Washington man 's death was announced , the CDC reported 2,254 confirmed U.S. cases of the virus with 104 people in hospital , up from 1,639 cases previously .
` ` <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009-05-10">Today</TIMEX3> there are almost 3,000 probable and confirmed cases here in the United States , '' Schuchat said .
` ` The good news is we are not seeing a rise above the epidemic threshold . ''
Japan reported four cases , and globally officials reported more than 4,200 people in 30 countries had been ill .
Australia reported its first case , a woman who been traveling in the United States but officials said she had made full recovery .
` ` We think this virus is in most of the United States , '' Schuchat said .
` ` The individual numbers are likely to be a very great underestimate . ''
More Americans are seeing doctors for influenza - like illnesses at a time of year when such visits usually decline .
Schuchat said tests showed they do not all have the new H1N1 virus .
Many have seasonal flu -- the H1N1 seasonal strain , the H3N2 seasonal strain and influenza B -- and other infections .
Seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally and infects up to a third of the population <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EACH">each year</TIMEX3> .
Health experts have not openly criticized efforts by other countries to stop the virus from getting in -- most notably China and its territory of Hong Kong , which have quarantined travellers in contact with patients .
A spokeswoman in Hong Kong said on <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="2009-05-09">Saturday</TIMEX3> that a Mexican traveler confirmed as Hong Kong 's first and only case of the new flu strain had been discharged from hospital .

The unidentified man , who unwittingly caused the confinement of almost 300 guests and staff at a Hong Kong hotel where he had stayed , had been in hospital for <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
China put seven people who had been exposed to three Japanese passengers diagnosed with the H1N1 flu in quarantine , the official Xinhua news agency quoted the government as saying .
Mexican health ministry spokesman Carlos Olmos said the government was testing thousands of samples to confirm which patients with severe respiratory symptoms were actually infected with the flu .
He said more than 5,000 tests had been done on suspected cases and that 1,578 people were ill but were being treated .
After the virus was identified on <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-04-23">April 23</TIMEX3> , Mexico banned public events and shut schools , bars , restaurants and many businesses to prevent people from gathering .
Officials say disinfection of public spaces has helped control its spread .
Schools in the capital will reopen on <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-05-11">Monday</TIMEX3> .

But the state government of Jalisco , home to Mexico 's second - largest city Guadalajara , said schools , nightclubs and theaters there will remain shut for another week after three suspected flu deaths .
Schuchat said it is not yet clear whether some measures taken have slowed the outbreak , but she said it was clear that early detection methods had alerted the world quickly .
She noted that the AIDS virus , which has <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> killed 25 million people globally and infects 33 million , spread for years before it was even identified .
` ` If we end up having a bad pandemic of influenza from this strain we would have had a real jump - start on things like vaccines , '' she said .
