Reuters -RRB- - Global trade in counterfeit goods , including medicines , CDs and DVDs , is expected to rise to nearly $ 1 trillion <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> as economies worldwide continue to slump , security experts said on <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-05-14">Thursday</TIMEX3> .
An estimated $ 800 billion in fake cigarettes , branded shoes , bags and belts , and pirated movies flowed across the globe in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2007">2007</TIMEX3> , Stephen Sayell , vice president of Hong Kong - based Asia Risk group , told Reuters .
That figure is expected to rise 20 percent <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> .
` ` As the global financial crisis deepens , the demand for much cheaper consumer goods rises , boosting sales of counterfeiters and movie pirates , '' Sayell said on the sidelines of a three - day anti - terrorism seminar in Manila .
Sayell said trade in counterfeit products has exceeded the global narcotics trade , worth more than $ 400 billion <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , citing studies made by his security consultancy group .
Proceeds from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes , CDs and DVDs and branded consumer goods could be funding terrorist groups around the world because the activities are considered high profit and low - risk , he added .
A former Scotland Yard officer , Sayell cited his experience in dealing with the Irish Republican Army 's counterfeiting operations to raise funds for their campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland .
` ` The IRA shifted from extorting money from the people to distributing pirated movies because they do n't find anything wrong stealing from Steven Spielberg , '' he added .
John Enoch , another Asia Risk executive based in Singapore , warned of the potential spread of fake anti - viral drugs in the face of the global scare of a new deadly strain of flu virus that has killed over 50 people and infected more than 5,000 worldwide .
` ` We expect a boom in counterfeit medicines and vaccines against flu , '' Enoch said , warning of potential high risk of a public health threat because of the improper use of anti - viral drugs .
In the Philippines , the health department has already issued a warning against offers by some medical facilities to provide anti - flu shots against the deadly strain of A - H1N1 virus that originated from Mexico .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="2009-04">Last month</TIMEX3> , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- warned against the proliferation of fake anti - malaria medicines in the Mekong area , blaming the counterfeit drugs for the emergence of a new strain of malaria that could spread in the region .
