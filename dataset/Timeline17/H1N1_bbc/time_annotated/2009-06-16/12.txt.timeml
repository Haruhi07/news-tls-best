Fergus Walsh | 18:17 UK time , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">Tuesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">16 June 2009</TIMEX3> Your eyes may glaze over at the thought of graphs .
But if , like me , you find them useful , then read on .
I ' m indebted to my colleague Kate Merriam from BBC Research for collating these figures from the World Health Organization website , from the HPA in England and from Health Protection in Scotland .
Before the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind .
First , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="P7W" mod="APPROX">around seven weeks</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Most of the cases mentioned will <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be virus - free and healthy .
Second , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DURATION" value="PXD">a couple of days</TIMEX3> .
For example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> figures from the CDC .
But the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable .
Third , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases .
The CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases .
Given those caveats , I think the figures are useful .
Global H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO .
As of <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="1700">1700</TIMEX3> BST on <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">15 June 2009</TIMEX3> , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths .
<TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> let 's look at some individual countries .
The number of confirmed cases in the UK <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> stands at 1,562 .
There has been one death , that of 38 - year - old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus .
<TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , it was announced that her son Jack had also died .
He did not have the virus .
A further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">today</TIMEX3> -LRB-
I think this is a record number for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="P1D">one day</TIMEX3> in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases .
Of the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus .
There was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine .
Three cases have been recorded in Wales .
Health Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory - confirmed cases <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">today</TIMEX3> , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation .
17,855 cases and 45 deaths at <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">15 June</TIMEX3> .
This represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on <TIMEX3 tid="t30" type="DATE" value="2009-06-12">12 June</TIMEX3> .
6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in <TIMEX3 tid="t32" type="DURATION" value="P3D">the last three days</TIMEX3> .
This can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community .
I will try to investigate further .
<TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non - essential travel to Mexico .
Proving the virus is incredibly mild , just look at the statistics .
And lets not even mention the CDC saying 19 out of 20 cases go unmissed , its such a weak flu virus <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> .
CDC in new york claim at least half a million cases in NY in may alone .
Using the recorded deaths in NY gives us a death rate of ... 0.000024 .

There is no way of routinely collecting data on how many people are <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> suffering .
Obviously it 's great that at the moment the virus is ` ` mild '' , but even if it does stay that way , it does n't mean we wo n't have severe problems because of it .
I feel the biggest issue from a public health perspective is the societal impact of large numbers of people having the virus at the same time .
It wo n't take much to severely affect health services , not to mention other things we take for granted such as deliveries of food , petrol , and running of transportation systems -LRB- due to staff sickness -RRB- .
As a resident of Gloucestershire , I know first hand how one event -LRB- flooding in that case -RRB- can have repercussions on the rest of life .
That 's why the authorities are right to be concerned .

That would at least give some indication of <TIMEX3 tid="t64" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> sufferers , but it would only be a rough estimate of course .

<TIMEX3 tid="t70" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Now</TIMEX3> that IS the point , the whole point and nothing but the point .
People -LRB- except virologists and academics -RRB- are n't particularly interested in how many people had the virus <TIMEX3 tid="t71" type="DATE" value="2009-W21">four weeks ago</TIMEX3> .
They ARE concerned to try to factor in whatever degree of risk there may be to their interests and functional ability .
Those interests might be trying to ensure a vulnerable relative is not exposed to the infection , or perhaps business continuity of a company , or local authority , or health trust in the event that the infection rate mushrooms .
It 's all wrapped up in that term ` ` societal impact '' .

However , I have an axe to grind about the way there seems to be a reaction to this type of flu that is way out of proportion - I mean new strains of viruses are constantly evolving , many far more virulent and dangerous , so why the huge fuss about this one ?
There are , in fact , far more globally endemic diseases that claim millions of lives <TIMEX3 tid="t81" type="SET" value="XXXX">annually</TIMEX3> with far too few proactive resources in place in the countries worst affected .
I have <TIMEX3 tid="t82" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> traveled back from the UK to a country in the Far East where I live and work .
I ' m a community development worker in some of the poorest places in this region .

Official figures for this country rate TB infection at 70 % .
In the places I work , those without access to healthcare , our estimate is far higher and people are dying .
Children are being disabled - yet there is no free medication or treatment program for children and their parents are too ill and too poor to afford drugs .
Dengue - there 's another one .
The unacknowledged presence of AIDS which I suspect underlies a large proportion of these fatalities .
Why do I mention this on a blog on Swine Flu ?
Well , on my return here <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="2009-W24">last week</TIMEX3> I was astounded to see the latest technology monitoring body temperatures as we disembarked .
All of a sudden every public place has sprouted disinfectant dispensers so we can all cleanse our hands .
The government has produced a flurry of paperwork charting provenance , past travel , contact with foreigners and a part requiring a list of any possible symptoms .
My daughter , suffering from jet lag , has been ordered to report to a hospital for tests .
Everywhere there is paranoia and people react in fear if we , as foreigners , so much as sniffle .
This paranoia is fuelled by posters that proclaim the dangers of Swine Flu - <TIMEX3 tid="t87" type="DATE" value="2009-06-16">today</TIMEX3> I read with incredulity the bald , unqualified statement , ` This Disease is Fatal to Humans '
What is going on ? ?
Has the world gone mad ?
Why is this such a perceived threat when real killers go untreated ?
Why ca n't the resources ploughed into preventing such a mild infection be better targeted ?
I ' m well aware of the devastation that H1N1 could wreak in one of the villages where I work - but the real problem would not be flu , it would be the pre - existing conditions that should have been recognized and dealt with a long time ago .
Well , this flu is n't that great a threat in many respects , at least not a ` health ' threat .
But it IS an administrative threat , meaning if civil servants and health experts are n't seen to be recommending and taking the best actions it could leave them open to criticism , or losing their jobs , or being sanctioned for poor performance .

And it is a political risk .

And it is a risk , as already suggested , to societal functioning .
But in the main , it is not really a significant direct threat to most individual 's personal health .
But you do have to factor in that if societal functioning were to be severely hampered by the effects of a flu outbreak , then the risks to an individual 's well - being and health might increase due to lack of access to medics , pharmacists , transport , etc . , etc . .
Of course , it is also a journalistic risk .
If the BBC do n't cover it , Sky or ITV will .
And the BBC is funded to provide public service information as well as entertainment .
So that might go some way to answering why there is so much media output about what is probably a comparatively minor risk when compared to some other infections .
Finally , the number of infected people does have the potential to escalate significantly - whether it actually does that or not - so that is another reason for the quantity of media coverage .
would suggest that the West Midlands region has had a higher number of reported and confirmed infections than Scotland per captita .
The West Midlands has a slightly higher population -LRB- about 5.3 million -RRB- compared to Scotland -LRB- about 5.1 million -RRB- .
But given that the first cases were in Scotland , the rate of spread in the West Midlands would seem to be faster .
Of course , there could be many other factors in place .
If , as may be the case , a higher percentage of the West Midlands cases involve children , then the involvement of medics may be more prevalent and , therefore , there may be better reporting and testing of cases .

The experts -LRB- and the Health Service -RRB- are hoping there will be a <TIMEX3 tid="t102" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">summer</TIMEX3> lull in new cases in the Northern Hemisphere with numbers not rising seriously until <TIMEX3 tid="t103" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the Autumn</TIMEX3> -LRB- when we should have at least some vaccine stocks in place
-RRB- .

But I ca n't really see any sign of that yet .
It would be interesting to know what the computer models are predicting , and at what point we should see the Northern Hemisphere case rate dropping off for <TIMEX3 tid="t104" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> .

We 're almost at 200 <TIMEX3 tid="t110" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> although I ' m sure there could be hundreds more cases that have gone undetected .
True , we have more cases than most parts of the UK but the one place in England that has more than us , the West Midlands has seen far more cases then London and the same with Scotland .
Perhaps its due to us being one of the warmest parts of the UK on average and thus the higher temperatures stop it from spreading as well as it would do in colder weather .
Whatever the reason , it is an interesting thing to ponder .
Hopefully , things will not increase here to the degree seen in Birmingham or Glasgow .

As this STRENGTHENS the ` ` BUG 'S '' IMMUNITY TO THE ANTIBIOTIC , HELPING TO BREED SUPER BUGS , which are much , much harder to deal with .
I think it should be well publicised , and strong warnings of the dangers of not completing full courses of Antibiotics , in Doctors surgery 's and on the Medicine packaging .
It is , of course , worth pointing out -LRB- for the avoidance of any doubt -RRB-
that antibiotics are thoroughly useless in treating flu itself in the normal course of events .
The only time they would be used is in treating the occasional opportunistic bacterial infections that might arise as a secondary result of flu .
In the vast majority of cases this does n't happen and antibiotic treatment would be a waste of time .
The point about finishing the course of a drug is well made though in general terms .
Notwithstanding rare side effects that make a drug impossible to continue with , it 's important to complete the course of any treatment to prevent resistance and\/or reoccurrence of an illness .
People should definitely be made aware of the necessity to complete drug treatments according to the correct instructions .

That was confirmed by the WHO to have no significance on the virus whatsoever , no increase in virluency , or infection methods , and it has no effect on a vaccine either , essentially it was literally nothing .
That s why most media did nt report it , everyone was sceptical and proven right , the scientists put out a statement with 99 percent made up information .
Luckily the masses never got hold of it else it would be panic panic again for <TIMEX3 tid="t133" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
SO
yes , no mutation happened , the strain is the same as before .

Try removing the gray background and the horizontal grid lines for a start - and it would n't hurt to make the line a bit thicker !
