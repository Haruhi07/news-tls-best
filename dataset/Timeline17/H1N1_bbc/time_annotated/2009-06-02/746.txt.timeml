For this country 's censors , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-W23">this week</TIMEX3> has been a busy time .
The Communist Party is trying to remove all references to the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent massacre on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-06">June</TIMEX3> 3rd\/4th .
An official chronicle of China 's <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> history may look a bit like this : <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="1985">1985</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="1986">1986</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1987">1987</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="1988">1988</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1990">1990</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="1991">1991</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="1992">1992</TIMEX3> etc . .
In China <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX3> , it 's as if <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="1989">the year 1989</TIMEX3> simply never happened .
In <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the last few days</TIMEX3> , we ' ve noticed a handful of unusual things ...
When my colleagues and I went to film in Tiananmen Square <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-05-29">last Friday</TIMEX3> , we were stopped four times by the police -LRB- normally we 're checked just once .
-RRB- Officers told us that we were not allowed to use our camera tripod to do any filming - something we ' ve never been told before .
In the embassy district in eastern Beijing , Chinese guards are <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> wearing flak jackets or stab vests over their uniforms - something that I have n't seen before , and I ' ve walked past these guards almost <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="SET" value="P1D" quant="EVERY">every day</TIMEX3> for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P2Y">the last two years</TIMEX3> .
When a colleague of mine mentioned Tiananmen Square during a mobile phone conversation , a Chinese voice interrupted his call for <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="DURATION" value="PTXS">a few seconds</TIMEX3> .
We get The Economist magazine mailed to our office <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="SET" value="P1W" quant="EVERY">every week</TIMEX3> .
The most <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX3> edition arrived with a page torn out of it -LRB-
The contents page shows that the missing page contained an article about the Tiananmen Square anniversary .

If you 're in China , have you noticed anything similar ?

Blogs and internet pages in China have told the story and even if the exact details remain secret the attack on the students by the PLA as odered by the leadership is no secret .
When the People 's Army attacked the People the relationship between the government and the governed changed .
China of <TIMEX3 tid="t33" type="DATE" value="2009">2009</TIMEX3> is a direct result of <TIMEX3 tid="t34" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> .
The battle within the leadership and the need to change direction was percipitated by the events of Tiananmen Square .
Things change slowly in this world and <TIMEX3 tid="t35" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">twenty years</TIMEX3> is not that long when discussing social change and in China that is a very short period for change .
The disheartening thing is that this is a secret that everyone knows and the Chinese government insist on maintaining silence about these events .
History is always written by the victors so it is never the truth .
In Hong Kong the events are memorialized , so within China there is recognition , just not official recognition .
It is also important to note that almost every country has had similar events where students or unions or refugees have confronted a sitting government and the actions to address such confrontations have been a show of force .
China utilized extreme force and that was the nature of the insecurity of the leadership at that time .
<TIMEX3 tid="t36" type="DURATION" value="P20Y">Twenty years</TIMEX3> prior had been the Cultural Revolution that scared an entire generation with fear and uncertainity .
<TIMEX3 tid="t37" type="DURATION" value="P1D">One day</TIMEX3> a statue will be erected in Tiananmen Square for the students , but that will come in time .
Like the British saying the Anglo - Chinese Wars were about dis - satisfaction of the Chinese with their government when it was really about selling opium in China , the truth sometimes takes awhile to become an accepted part of a national history .
A repressive and paranoid dictatorship at it 's best .
No doubt the overseas Chinese will defend the government of a country where they chose not to live\/have never lived .

The repression of the students ' rebellion resulted in social and political peace for China and an unprecedented economic growth and development .

Would that have happened had the country fell into anarchy and chaos in the name of so called ` ` democracy '' ?

there are not many media coverage on those people , they are not dala lama , but they should be carefully look at , as they led students to their ends of lives , when they had only dreams as they push it by hunger strike , with no practical solution what so ever .
please , its so irritating , when bbc kept this kind cold war thinking and try to force people to belive that the Chinese Government carry out killing for fun .
Yes , the students were killed , but for the sick of China 's stability , for the law and order , if they stay at that night , they should shoulder the consequences .

Because I have different view point of the BBC .
I ' m 27 years old <TIMEX3 tid="t138" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> , and I live in Beijing .
I have go to the Tiananmen just <TIMEX3 tid="t142" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several day</TIMEX3> before the disaster with my father .
But we went back home after <TIMEX3 tid="t144" type="DURATION" value="PT2H" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS">no more than 2 hours</TIMEX3> .
The protest acturally last a very long time .
From a small group of student to huge amount of people including lots of people just came for fun .
I ' m really serious !
At last some of them are just come for fun -LRB- such as me , that time I was only 7 years old -RRB- .
You need to know .
There are culture revolution before , in culture revolution , people could run to every place of china , and in that time , except some event , you could n't leave your city or villiage , you need to work .
And all the people have his work assembled by gov , even the children need to go to school .
But those day , all the school in Beijing stopped classes .
So I can visit Tianmen for fun .
And my father is a phd student that time .
He really with to advice some thought to the gov .
However , when we go to there , we found thing is n't right .
Most of the people 's motion in there are crazy .
The people who is calm as my father dislike that situation , so we leave .
And lots of people leave also .
Only the most crazy people are stay there <TIMEX3 tid="t148" type="DURATION" value="P1D" mod="MORE_THAN">more than one day</TIMEX3> .
More things are , First I should say , I do n't discriminate the people who is n't live in Beijing , because both my parents are born in Shandon province .
But a small amount people who came from other province stay in Tiananmen is n't peace .
They burn and break the things to consume their angry ...
Actually I did n't think all of them are really extrimely angry , some is only for exiting ,
that the first time they come to the capital of china , the center of capital , and its also the first time to destroy something which if they do in their own hometown would be punished very strict .
One thing is ture , which may disappoint most of the anti - china medium .
The students who come to Tiananmen first is n't anti - communism at all .
Actually , most of them are communisms as my father .
They think the direction of the country is n't right , and for a communist , he has the duty to correct the direction of the country .
-LRB-
It sounds a little ridiculous <TIMEX3 tid="t152" type="DATE" value="2009-06-02">today</TIMEX3> , is n't it ?
-RRB-

My there are old word in china , that every people need to help the country to pass the bad times .
And those communists are the one who bravely come out to advice the party the right way .
So , no student is come to show their angry to the goverment at the begining time , they are going to give the goverment advice .
However , after the priminister Li Peng refuse to accept the letter of the advice from the students several times .
The students angry that they hav n't be respect .
And some of them swear , if the Li Peng did n't come out to receive the letter , then they wo n't go back home .
After <TIMEX3 tid="t153" type="DURATION" value="PXD">some days</TIMEX3> protest .
Li Peng was afraid , and call the army to protect the order .
But at first , its only come to protect the order .
The army went through my house , and the soldiers rest at the door of my house , they are laughly talking with each other , and it is definitely their first time come to Beijing , they are friendly to the citizens around them , and they really do n't know what will happened just <TIMEX3 tid="t154" type="DURATION" value="PXD">several days</TIMEX3> after .
However , disaster happened when a bunch of ` ` Football hooligans '' meet a coward priadminister Li Peng .
And really , before the disaster happen , some soliders who watching the protest has been killed by some bad people , but no solider is killed by students .
However , who can identificate who is angry student and who is mob ?
Mob usually run away first when they say the gov is really angry , but the students who did n't know there are soliders have been killed , they do n't think the govment seriousely wish to repressive , they did n't leave and been killed without know why .
Li Peng is a fool .
Most of communists have the same thought as I.

However , I wonder how the cities of London , New York , or Paris would do if their students gathered at the largest plaza in their countries eating , sleeping , and carrying out other humanly business for TWO months , in the name of , lets say , anti - globalization or anti - corporate greed ?
Would these Euro - centric governments allow their national plaza turn into a public cesspool for TWO months ?
I also wonder when their students were out on the largest plaza in their countries protesting their governments , would any of the governmental officials go meet and listen to those students .
This is because for weeks before crack down on <TIMEX3 tid="t165" type="DATE" value="2009-06-04">June 4th</TIMEX3> , ALL levels of Chinese officials from the City of Beijing to the President of China all came out to meet the students and listen to their voices at the plaza or in their offices which were all broadcast on Chinese national TVs .
That has never happened or it would ever happen in ANY other Euro - centric countries !
In <TIMEX3 tid="t166" type="DATE" value="1989">1989</TIMEX3> , the entire police force in the City of Beijing was not even 5 % of the police force in the City of New York .
So what else could the City of Beijing have done differently to remove the students from their largest national plaza after TWO long months if not using the army at the time when there were no such things as anti - riot police or national guards like we have in the U. S ?

While the Euro - centric countries can point fingers at China for what China did on <TIMEX3 tid="t170" type="DATE" value="1989-06-04">June 4th 1989</TIMEX3> , if the same thing happened in their countries , they would do the exactly same as the Chinese government did on <TIMEX3 tid="t172" type="DATE" value="2009-06-04">June 4th</TIMEX3> .
The only difference might be that the Euro - centric countries would NEVER allow their students to camp out on their national plaza for <TIMEX3 tid="t173" type="DURATION" value="PXD" mod="MORE_THAN">more than a couple of days</TIMEX3> , let alone TWO long months .
About those student leaders , how could they ask others to hunger strike while themselves drink and feast ?
And mostly , how could they ask other students to ` ` shed blood '' or ` ` sacrifice lives for democracy '' while themselves were already in contact with foreign agencies planning their own escape routes so that they d not die for their causes and live in the U.S or Europe as that 's where most of them ended up days after <TIMEX3 tid="t176" type="DATE" value="1989-06-04">June 4th 1989</TIMEX3> ?
<TIMEX3 tid="t178" type="DATE" value="2009">20 years later</TIMEX3> , as if it never happened ... because it was only significant to fewer than handful of Chinese when you look at the entire population of China and if you have just a little cultural knowledge about China .
However , it is MOST significant for Euro - centric countries that want to utilize it for material means on contract negotiating tables in <TIMEX3 tid="t181" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent years</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t184" type="DURATION" value="PXY">some years</TIMEX3> to come .

I still remember those caotic periods , students from all over the country traveling to Beijing -LRB-
they can travel free with their student ID at that time , the whole country was disfunctional .
Having experienced culture revolution , my parents were extremely worried as they thought another culture revolution were going to happen .
For those who studied Chinese histtory during culture revolution , they should know that started exactly the same with students went on protesting , parading , camping in Tiananmen square .
Whatever happened , Chinese government should not use the force at that level , however , the students leaders , the foreign journalists and Zhao ZiYang all should bear responsibilities .

As with any movement there are also hardcore instigators who will always refuse to admit they were wrong , and these are the ones that are glorified in the west but shunned in China .

As said on James Mile 's article : ` ` Reports of the pro - democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and their violent end have had a huge impact on how the outside world sees China . ''
What the outside world needs to understand is that ` ` democracy '' is n't always the best option for 1.3 billion people at a point in time .
Pressure from without will not change what the people want , it needs to come from within , and surely when the society advances to the point where it can support democracy , it will happen regardless of government control .
You can cite Tiananmen all you want as an example of government suppression , but if the Chinese people really want democracy , it ca n't be suppressed .
So with the Economic crisis on hold , H1N1 under control , and not much actual China news , is it time to raise negative feelings against China again ?

You do n't need tanks and rifles to remove people from the square .

This kind of crude generalisation is no better than those which assume the Chinese people to be a homogeneous mass with exactly the same thoughts and feelings and aspirations .
Sympathy is a basic human impulse , one which crosses boundaries of race and nationality .

James Reynolds might still be in the kindergarten or grade school .
I watched the event through American TV , and I swear I did not see any scene of ` massacre ' , nor did I see ` hundreds of thousands ' killed .
I did see some young people got hurt and were put on three wheel carts , evidently being rushed to the hospitals .
I also saw mob climbed up to a tank and set it on fire .
Do n't remember if the soldiers in the tank got killed or not .
There were many many foreign media , equipped with advanced communication gears , working so hard trying to take the advantage of the situation .
They thought they got the best opportunity to defeat China using Chinese .
They all seem worried the event would n't be big enough to topple the government ...
That is the core problem .
The naive students saw the foreign media and believed they got help and refused to back down .
Because of the fanning flame by foreigners , I do n't think the government made a mistake by sending in the troops .
Riot police with water cannons simply would n't have done it .
I agree wholeheartedly China needs to gradually improve itself on governing by ` rule of law ' , reducing corruption , etc . .

That is your own feeling , Sir , please to understand here , most of Chinese are sad for students who lost lives , but they pleased the situation had been controlled !
and those yobs , mobs , roitors whom would understand freedom and democracy equal to lawlessness , had been brought into justice .

people with extremely anti chinese view may would have commenting in this logic .
I would say the benefit is that China had been saved from total social unrest and political disaster .
peaceful protest is allowed in wherever around the world , but violent and destructive behaviors would meet with tough solution not only in China .
At the time , the Chinese government had neither crowd control experience nor equipment like water canon and tear gas .

Something like ` The government did the right think to suppress the riots , and lead to the tens of years of significant economic growth . '
The student and civilians had a good cause to demonstrate : corruption , officers game the government procurement system to make big money at the expense of the civilians , lack of democracy , etc . .
They did n't bring weapons from their home , did they ?
The troops came in and shoot the civilians and students for what ?

To let the CCP remain in the superior position .
Why do the ` western media ' mind the business of China ?
The people and government of the developed countries share the same set of values : the country are country of the people , so it should not do harm to the people -LRB- including corruption -RRB- , so killing the people is the last thing it should do .
That 's why their government , their media , their people , criticize CCP .
CCP , to maintain it 's power , to stop the influence from the outside world , tell the people : western want to undermine our country .
CCP black out the media from the outside world .
They did it , it is proved successful .
Unluckily , more than 60 % people in Hong Kong still criticize the June4 massacre .
The government are already doing the ` right ' thing , and they need to put more effort on advertising the CCP 's philosophy .

I think the CCP should stop fooling their people into believing CCP =
China .
Even if CCP fell as a result of the protest , China would n't suddenly cease to exist .

Most people here may have never seen the video of this ` ` tankman '' .
Actually in the video , the defiant man challenged the tanks by standing still .
When the tanks want to move around him , he move too to stop them .
Later he threw a burning bottle full of gasoline to the tank , and the tank caught fire immediately .
Soldiers then hurried out of the tank in fear of burning to death .
That 's the story told be the original video tape .
Unfortunately it was seldom broadcasted because the material is not suitable for western media to tell the audience the story they want to tell .
But a static picture , believe it or not , give media more space to fabricate stories .

Make sure you have seen the original footage before you post .
There was conflict , there was no massacre .
To all the Chinese people commenting in here , stop arguing .
Almost always , those who initiate the conversation have enough to eat you alive .
State what you have to state and leave .
Do n't fight back - you wo n't win that way .
Furthermore , do n't challenge the BBC to post your comment .
They 're always glad to do that in order to show off how democratic and free they are .
People are fooled in any country .
As much as what the government says is -LRB- most of the time -RRB- true , ten times more reasons lie behind every decision of every administration , mostly to maximize the country 's security\/financial\/economic benefits .
This argument we 're having here only proves that China is feared to become a superpower .
China does n't have a democracy .
Democracy is for westerners who inherited humanism and individualism thoughts emerged around the Renaissance .
China does n't need a democracy .
Democracy is for countries that , being either too strong or too weak , do n't have a catch - up job to do .
But in these statements ` ` democracy '' meant US - style democracy , in which , voting is the only solution to problems , and not everyone has the money to hold nation - wide elections .
Oh wait <TIMEX3 tid="t504" type="DURATION" value="PT1M">a minute</TIMEX3> , has the US ever voted on whether to attack Iraq outside the congress ?
Like they voted for a president who is certainly for or against abortion ?
This is after all <TIMEX3 tid="t505" type="DATE" value="1989">20 years ago</TIMEX3> .
That 's 1\/3 of this country 's life .
What was the US like when it was <TIMEX3 tid="t508" type="DATE" value="1949">60 years ago</TIMEX3> ?
What was the UK like ?
It is n't fair to compare the <TIMEX3 tid="t511" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> China to the <TIMEX3 tid="t512" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> US .
Human Rights - you might mean it , your president does n't .
It is nice to read these ideas .
Anyhow , I come here just to express my feelings , and read opinions from other people .
I never expect fighting with words can change anything , only honest hard working counts .
China is making her steady progress , and certainly this will go on .
And , we will be part of this story .

There were of cause a few bad elements mixed in there , which is normal , but most of them no doubt were patriotic .
Their motive should n't be discredited .
The problem was the foreign media were way too ` excited ' .
That might have led the crowd into thinking they were about to break the will of the government .
They , knowing the foreign media were on their side , got bolder and bolder everyday -LRB-
I remember seeing at least one boy in his pajamas meeting with the government leaders -RRB- , and stubbornly refused to back down unless they got what they wanted .
Imagine if the government caved in and met their demands , whatever they were , there would have ` demonstrations ' everywhere in the country everyday , demanding all sorts of things , and the whole nation would have been in complete chaos , if not disintegrated into pieces .
And the foreign powers certainly would have sent in the occupying troops -LRB- using the pretext of protecting their own citizens ... sound familiar ?
-RRB- .
China would have been set back 100 , <TIMEX3 tid="t519" type="DURATION" value="P200Y">200 years</TIMEX3> , and very likely just vanished from this earth altogether .
I hope China , the government and the people , will keep improving things on all aspects -LRB- especially corruptions and rule of law -RRB- , and stupidity like this would never happen again .

For example I could not visit the BBC website , but the UK national papers ' websites : the Indy , Guardian , Times , Telegraph etc . . .

In fact I sat in a Beijing hostel reading the contents of an allegedly censored World Bank report on China 's air and water standards without anyone taking the slightest interest .
Similarly with the people I met ; those who did n't seem to care much about politics had very little realisation of the international criticisms of China , on the other hand those who wanted to know were very well informed .
There 's a remarkable place in Beijing called Factory 798 , it 's a commune of artists and radicals -LRB- anyone going to Beijing should take <TIMEX3 tid="t526" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> to wander through the galleries and studios -RRB- , many of the residents are the remnant of ' 89 .

While the government undoubtedly keeps an eye on them their , often aggressive , anti - government art and sentiment is allowed to flourish .
Censorship in any form should be done away with , however what surprised me in China was , in the East coast cities , how symbolic it had become .
My guess -LRB-
and it is just that -RRB- is the situation outside of the East Coast cities -LRB- which are frequented by Westerners -RRB- is far worse .
As computer prices drop and interned access becomes more widespread it will be fascinating to see how the CCP reacts .
What I would say is that the CCP seemed to have learned the lessons of East Germany and realized that in a global economy they ca n't build walls , and so Nike et al all do a roaring trade .
It is possible they will have to acquiesce to the global information network that is the internet in a similar fashion .
Are you living in China ?

If yes , you have just told us that you have access to sensitive pieces of information that I do n't here in Hong Kong .
If what you said is true , i.e. you have watched the video showing the ` tankman ' threw some ` burning bottle full of gasoline to the tank ' , then you have corrected my -LRB-
but I think I am not alone -RRB- biased view that mainland China have banned all discussion and materials concerning <TIMEX3 tid="t529" type="DATE" value="1989-06-04">June 4 1989</TIMEX3> .
Your post started out sensible but degenerated rapidly into unrestrained fantasy .
` ` And the foreign powers certainly would have sent in the occupying troops -LRB- using the pretext of protecting their own citizens ... sound familiar ?

Do you mean like during the boxer rebellion ?

Or like the Japanese occupation ?
Do you still believe references to such distant history are relevant to <TIMEX3 tid="t531" type="DATE" value="2009-06-02">today</TIMEX3> 's world ?
Perhaps in the mind of the CCP propaganda machine - a useful rallying cry for nationalism after all .
In any case , what power or coalition of powers would have had the manpower or remotest wish to have done as you suggest ?
