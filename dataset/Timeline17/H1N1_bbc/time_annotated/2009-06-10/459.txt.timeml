The World Health Organization last declared a pandemic <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="1968">41 years ago</TIMEX3> A sharp increase in swine flu cases in Australia may mean the infection has become a pandemic , the World Health Organization says .
For that to happen , officials would have to verify that the disease had become established outside North America , where the crisis began .
` ` Once I get indisputable evidence , I will make the announcement , '' said WHO director general , Margaret Chan .
More than 1,200 people have contracted the virus in Australia - none fatally .
The total means Australia has seen a four - fold increase in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-05" mod="LESS_THAN">Less than a month ago</TIMEX3> the country had only a handful of cases of the H1N1 virus but it <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> has the highest number of infections outside North America .
Victoria and the state capital , Melbourne , are the worst - hit with more than 1,000 confirmed cases .
Most of those affected are suffering only a mild illness , but the Health Minister of Australia 's Queensland state , Paul Lucas , has warned that the contagious respiratory condition would inevitably claim lives .
It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased The head of the WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda , said the situation had ` ` evolved a lot '' in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are getting close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , '' he said .
But Dr Fukuda urged calm .
` ` It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased or that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than before , '' he said .
Following the major outbreaks in North America the flu alert is <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">currently</TIMEX3> at phase five of a six - level scale .
The virus has infected more than 26,500 people in 73 countries .
The WHO held a conference call with governments on <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="2009-06-10">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , but afterwards said no decision had been taken on moving to phase six - the pandemic stage - at the moment .
Gregory Hartl , WHOs spokesperson for epidemic and pandemic diseases , said if a pandemic was announced it would not be the ` ` apocalyptic situation '' envisaged when bird flu looked liked it would be the cause .
` ` What we are seeing <TIMEX3 tid="t21" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self - limting , lets say 98 - 98 % of the people we know to be affected recover without any need for hospitalisation , as far as we can tell .
` ` We do understand that the natural reaction of people if and when we declare phase six could be very strong .
` ` But we would hope that there would be quiet quickly an adjustment reaction , as happened in the US , when people realized they were n't getting seriously ill . ''
The media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over - reacting BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh says it is true that the word ` ` pandemic '' sounds scary .

But it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease .
He says it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent - only a measure of its geographical spread .
As the number of H1N1 cases in Australia passes 1,200 , Singapore has urged its citizens to avoid travel to Victoria .
Authorities in New South Wales and South Australia , as well as the national capital , Canberra , have told children who have <TIMEX3 tid="t22" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> traveled to Melbourne to stay away from school for <TIMEX3 tid="t24" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> on their return home .
The entire squad and staff of the Brisbane Broncos rugby league club have been put into quarantine as tests are carried out on a player suspected of contracting swine flu .
