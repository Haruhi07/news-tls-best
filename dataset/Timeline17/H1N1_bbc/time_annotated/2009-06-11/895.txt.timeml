Many countries already have swine flu precautions in place UN health officials are expected to declare the first global flu pandemic in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION" value="P40Y">40 years</TIMEX3> , after holding emergency talks on the swine flu crisis .
The World Health Organization called the meeting after a steep rise in the number of cases in Australia .
A BBC correspondent says it has little option but to declare a pandemic <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> there are nearly 28,000 recorded cases .
Reports say that the WHO had already told member countries it had decided to raise the alert to pandemic level .
Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION" value="P2W">two weeks</TIMEX3> following 12 school cases .
The last global flu pandemic came in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="1968">1968</TIMEX3> over the Hong Kong flu .
That pandemic killed about one million people .
A disease is classed as a pandemic when transmission between humans becomes widespread in at least two regions of the world .
The latest virus emerged in Mexico in <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="2009-04">April</TIMEX3> and since then thousands of cases have been confirmed throughout North and South America .
The H1N1 strain has spread to 74 countries but the WHO has so far resisted labeling the outbreak a full - blown pandemic .
SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu
It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="1918">1918</TIMEX3> flu pandemic <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">Current</TIMEX3> treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised WHO chief Margaret Chan talked to officials from eight countries with large flu outbreaks on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-06-10">Wednesday</TIMEX3> in an attempt to confirm the spread of the disease .
She said she believed the situation could be regarded as a pandemic but wanted clear evidence before making an announcement .
The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the problem is that the pandemic phase system is designed for a very different type of virus .
WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it had been expecting something more like the deadlier bird flu .
` ` It was believed that the next pandemic would be something like H5N1 bird flu , where you were seeing really high death rates , and so there were people who believed we might be in a kind of apocalyptic situation and what we 're really seeing <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self - limiting , '' he told the BBC .
Phase 1 : No infections in humans are being caused by viruses circulating in animals .
Phase 2 : Animal flu virus causes infection in humans , and is a potential pandemic threat .
Phase 3 : Flu causes sporadic cases in people , but no significant human - to - human transmission .
Phase 4 : Human - to - human transmission and community - level outbreaks .
Phase 5 : Human - to - human transmission in at least two countries .
Strong signal pandemic imminent .
Phase 6 :
Virus spreads to another country in a different region .
Global pandemic under way .
Post - peak : Pandemic activity appears to be decreasing though second wave possible .
Post - pandemic : activity returns to normal , seasonal flu levels .

The WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate , our correspondent says .
It is concerned not to trigger panic measures such as border closures and travel bans and is expected to advocate careful medical management , including the moderate use of anti - viral drug tamiflu .
Using it on a widespread preventative scale could simply create drug resistance , our correspondent adds .

The WHO 's move follows Australia 's confirmation of more than 1,200 cases - a four - fold increase in <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> .
All primary schools and nurseries in Hong Kong are to shut for <TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DURATION" value="P14D">14 days</TIMEX3> from <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-06-05">Friday</TIMEX3> in a bid to contain the virus , the territory 's chief executive Donald Tsang said .
It follows confirmation that 12 secondary school pupils have contracted the illness .
Secondary schools are not yet being ordered to close .
At least 50 people are <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> confirmed to have the virus in the territory .
The head of the WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda , said the situation had ` ` evolved a lot '' in <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recent days</TIMEX3> .
` ` We are getting close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , '' he said .
Although most sufferers experience normal flu symptoms and make a full recovery , the WHO has confirmed 141 deaths from 27,737 cases .
