Fergus Walsh | <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="TIME" value="XXXX-XX-XXT26:07">14:07 PM</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">Monday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</TIMEX3> One of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">the autumn</TIMEX3> .
Professor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> break would give swine flu the ` ` opportunity '' that it needs to spread .
Another fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="2009-05-31">yesterday</TIMEX3> by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 .
One of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there .
But Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : ` ` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled .
That does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . ''
However , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes .
` ` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said .
` ` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it .
` ` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . ''
Professor Oxford said that in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PXM">the next few months</TIMEX3> , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa .
The southern hemisphere is entering its <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">winter</TIMEX3> and the peak period for flu .
On <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-05-29">Friday</TIMEX3> , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa .
What happens in the southern hemisphere in the <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="FUTURE_REF">coming months</TIMEX3> will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="2009" mod="END">later this year</TIMEX3> .
There would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness .
Thankfully , there are no signs of that yet .

The Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there .
The Science Media Centre in London has lots of reliable specialist comments on flu and a host of other issues .

If a million people had died in Mexico we would have something to worry about , but as it is this flu seems no worse than normal flu , even though it has an unusual origin .
Unusual does not equate to dangerous
and I wish that the relative risks had been far better explored before the Beeb had decided to follow the herd and jump off the deep end .
Thousands of people die of flu <TIMEX3 tid="t25" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> , whilst millions die of diahorrhea
so perhaps you could instead whip up some hysteria where it is 100 % justified and could genuinely help to reduce the number of preventable deaths in the world .

I believe they predicted that 25 % -50 % of the population would catch swine flu at some stage - probably <TIMEX3 tid="t45" type="DATE" value="2009-WI">next winter</TIMEX3> .
Of these , 0.25 - 1 % would die .
So the scenario for swine flu related deaths in the UK is : Anywwhere between 37,500 and 300,000 deaths .
I presume these numbers were a prediction for <TIMEX3 tid="t49" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">the next 12 months</TIMEX3> .
I do n't believe this is reason to panic .
It is , however , reason to have some concern .
One would expect hospitals and health care to get very stretched , probably overstretched , in <TIMEX3 tid="t50" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six month</TIMEX3> 's time .
One would expect some level of disruption .
The scariest thing : One would expect to experience a bereavement in <TIMEX3 tid="t51" type="DATE" value="2010">the next year</TIMEX3> .
This flu is not the equivalent of the Great War - but neither is it just the equivalent of a Heat Wave , in terms of its likely impact .
I find advice telling people to sneeze hygienically stupid : It does not benefit the sneezer , and it only might benefit the sneezed at people .
I do n't want advice on ` ` how to keep your illness to yourself '' - I want advice on ` ` how to not get ill , or minimize the impact if you do '' .
If I were the government , I would advise people to try and keep their immune system strong <TIMEX3 tid="t52" type="DATE" value="2009">this year</TIMEX3> , at least until the flu season has passed .
If that means healthier living and less excess for <TIMEX3 tid="t54" type="DURATION" value="P1Y">a year</TIMEX3> , then so be it .
I 'd rather catch the flu after spending <TIMEX3 tid="t55" type="DURATION" value="P6M">six months</TIMEX3> eating and drinking sensibly , than after weeks of poor nutrition and binge drinking .
As for Tamilflu - I would like to know how bad the side effects are -LRB- and the likely mortality from those -RRB- before I 'd consider taking it .

It just means a disease outbreak that has spread around the world , not doomsday .
The word describes the spread of a disease , not its lethality .

By saying that a swine flu pandemic is imminent neither the BBC nor the government or universities are guilty of scare - mongering .
People who accuse them of being so are guilty of being too lazy to use a dictionary or check the WHO website .
By the way , I ' m a virologist
and I ' m sticking with calling it swine flu rather than H1N1 because it has been shown to be mostly from swine lineages .
There are so many circulating H1N1 strains of human origin that calling it swine flu is about as helpful as telling a policeman that you were hit by a silver car , instead of a Toyota Corolla with licence plate ABC 1234 .

Mr Fergus Walsh could at least bring some of the new learning into the discussion .
It should not be up to us , the bloggers and twitters to spell out necessary changes to government and populations that are needed to reduce the speed of infection to a manageable rate .
One of the ideas put forward is the protection of agency workers , to enable them to go off sick if they become ill .
Many agency workers have to take risks and work whether they are ill or not , because they are not covered by the usual protection that a regular employee enjoys .
A regular employee can take comfort in the fact that they know which days they will be working , have holiday pay , have normal sickness benefits etc etc . .
An agency worker is called in to cover a worker who has gone off SICK .
The government has already advised certain work groups to keep a list of agencies to whom they can get cover when their workers go off sick .
Should there <TIMEX3 tid="t85" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> be greater protection for agency workers ?
After all agency workers help out when there is no - one else available , and without them , some key work areas could find themselves seriously compromised .
Very mild symptoms which would have been missed if I had n't found out by chance that she 'd had contact with a confirmed case at school .
That was <TIMEX3 tid="t86" type="DATE" value="2009-05-28">last Thursday</TIMEX3> .
So far neither my husband nor I have any symptoms and our daughter has fully recovered .
She was given Tamiflu to hasten recovery , but we would prefer not to take it ourselves as we do n't have any symptoms and want to build up our own immunity in case this flu returns in a nastier form .
Our family has been quarantined , but the ` contain ' policy is being reviewed as more schools are closing and more cases confirmed .
Victoria -LRB- where we live -RRB- has the majority of cases in Australia - almost 400 here alone .
My suggestion is to be cautious and let common sense prevail .
There is a lot you can do to prevent the spread of flu , but it 's proven to be more of an inconvenience than a threat so far .
Thanks to drmattprescott for your comments .
Have a good look in the blog and on the BBC coverage
and I ' m confident that you wo n't find any hysterical claims from correspondents about swine flu .
If you watched the Six or Ten o'clock news on BBC1 on <TIMEX3 tid="t88" type="DATE" value="2009-05-29">Friday</TIMEX3> you would have seen me do a report about the threat of drug - resistant malaria .
I have also reported several times on HIV\/AIDS , TB and child mortality - from a variety of causes - including diarrhoea .
You are quite right to say that thousands of people die from flu <TIMEX3 tid="t89" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> - the WHO global estimate is 250,000 - 500 , 000 .
I have pointed this out several times .
Death estimates for flu are not simple
but it 's thought that between one and two million people died in each of the last two pandemics , many times more than with seasonal flu .
Clearly that is not as many as die from malaria , TB and HIV\/AIDS , but a pandemic , even of largely mild illness , would have a huge impact both in the UK and internationally .
In Britain , hundreds of thousands of people might be off work during the peak periods of infection and that would have a major economic and social impact - far more than with seasonal flu .
I ca n't give personal health guidance on this blog - not least because I ' m not medically qualified .
If you are ill you should probably seek medical advice of some kind , via NHS Direct , or NHS 24 in Scotland .
It 's generally not a good idea for people with coughs , colds or flu to take the virus down to their GP surgery .
Hope you feel better soon .
Thanks for your comments Ikarus .
An earlier post ` ` Explaining flu '' gives you the predictions about mortality in the UK in a pandemic .
Like all drugs , Tamiflu has potential side - effects , nausea being a common complaint .
RE Comment 5 : Let me clear up any confusion about what Professor Oxford 's comments .
He is advising that healthy people should carry on life as normal , in the event of a pandemic , although they should follow sensible hygiene guidance .
But sick people should stay at home and keep the flu virus to themselves .
RE Comments 6 and 7 .
It 's interesting that the CDC and WHO stopped calling it swine flu sme time ago .
The CDC goes for ` ` novel influenza
A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' and the WHO ` ` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection '' .
Both are a bit of a mouthful for when I ' m reportng on TV or radio .
I tend to call it H1N1 swine flu when I mention it first and then shorten that to swine flu or H1N1 virus afterwards .
RE Comment 9 , thanks very much for getting in touch .
It 's very good to know what is happening on the ground in Australia and to hear that your daughter is ok .
Please let me know how she gets on with the Tamiflu and whether she suffers any of the reported side - effects such as nausea -LRB- which seem to be very mild -RRB- .
I 'd be interested to get some first - hand accounts of the disease and the treatment .

Please point out to me where I suggest that someone close to you is going to die from swine flu in <TIMEX3 tid="t98" type="DATE" value="2010">the next year</TIMEX3> ?
I have never intended to imply that .
Remember that ` ` pandemic '' means simply a global epidemic of an infectious disease .
It does not imply severity .
Thankfully , the vast majority of cases of swine flu so far have been mild .
At present you need to have underlying health conditions or be very unlucky to be struck down severely ill with the virus .

But the case of the 45 - year - old man in hospital in Paisley - who had been otherwise healthy - shows that H1N1 is not always a mild disease .

Neither my husband nor I had any flu symptoms at all despite being in close contact with our daughter the whole time .
I understand that the authorities would only test for H1N1 if there had been contact with a confirmed case , even if someone had flu like symptoms .
Consequently I heard of children who were ill , but not tested as there was no known contact with a confirmed case .
The authorities in Victoria have struggled to deal with this epidemic and it 's easy to see how a pandemic of a more serious nature could claim many lives world wide .

At the end of the day there are some far more serious health problems worldwide so why bother about yet another one which is minor in comparison anyway ? ? ?

they are going to face far far more serious problems and will have to make extraordinarily difficult decisions once world -LRB- i.e. non - localized -RRB- water and food problems start happening <TIMEX3 tid="t119" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
i.e. they will simply have to say ` ` No , we only have enough to save ourselves ! ''
But , on a positive note , the ONLY realistic way to achieve any significant reduction in CO2 is for major global population reduction ...
so , we need - yes NEED - either a series of high - mortality pandemics , a high - mortality war -LRB- or two -RRB- , or mass starvation .
But , lets be realistic , the most politically acceptable is , of course , an ` ` uncontrollable '' pandemic .
It will happen ...
world governments just wish it were sooner rather than later -LRB-
that is IF global warming is accepted as a serious problem by governments in the first place ... which it appears not to be -RRB- .
