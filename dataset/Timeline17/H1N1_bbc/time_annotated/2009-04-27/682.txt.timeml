Experts suspect swine flu has killed more than 100 people in Mexico As international concern about swine flu grows , the BBC 's Jill McGivering asks what relevant lessons have been learned in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P12Y">the past 12 years</TIMEX3> , since the emergence of the new strain of bird flu and the Sars epidemic .
It is new , but it is also familiar - <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="1997">12 years ago</TIMEX3> , a new strain of bird flu emerged in Hong Kong that was seen as the possible start of a deadly flu pandemic .
<TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE" value="2003">Six years ago</TIMEX3> came the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- Sars -RRB- epidemic .
That too was centred on Asia but caused more than 800 deaths worldwide .
Since then , there has been massive investment in dealing with a flu - like pandemic .
Many individual countries learned painful lessons .
Some , like China , found they needed to be much more transparent and to improve their basic surveillance and reporting systems .
Scientists are <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in a better position to make a vaccine quickly To stop spread , cases need to be identified quickly and effectively .
Governments needed to accept that information must be shared globally , even if the political instinct was to avoid admitting the scale of the problem .

The continuing anxiety about a bird flu pandemic has forced bodies like the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- to invest in prevention strategies .
There have been years of developing strategy and training on how to handle a flu pandemic - and multiple workshops and mock exercises .
Experts have been sent around the world to assess procedures on the ground and give advice .
Although the threat in mind was from an H5 or H9 type flu , much of the training has been generic , so it is just as relevant <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> .
Scientists say the investment in global research may pay off too .
More people <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it They are <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> in a much better position than they were <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="1999">10 years ago</TIMEX3> to make a vaccine quickly , one which is perfectly matched against a particular viral strain .
Some experts in the field say that with the heightened level of co - operation that <TIMEX3 tid="t20" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> exists , it may be possible to have a vaccine for this form of H1N1 ready to distribute in a matter of months .
Scientists , as well as politicians , have learned to share information more openly .
The culture of secrecy and competition that persisted <TIMEX3 tid="t23" type="DATE" value="1999">10 years ago</TIMEX3> was addressed during the Sars crisis - and largely resolved .
More people <TIMEX3 tid="t26" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it , and understand that the WHO will keep a stock of any resulting vaccine so they can help poorer countries have access to it .
Governments who found themselves on the front line of previous crises have become some of the best prepared .
Indonesia has brought back thermal scanners used for Sars and bird flu
And where people have previously experienced a threat , there seems to be more readiness for the public to accept rules and procedures which might limit individual freedoms , but could help to protect them .
Hong Kong , for example , has kept up the practice of facial thermal imaging , introduced during Sars .
It automatically screens every new arrival to identify those with high temperatures - a possible flu symptom .
Governments , especially those in the developing world , have to make tough decisions about how to use their limited resources .
Is it better to invest in protection against a possible future crisis , like a flu pandemic , which may never happen ?
Or to focus on meeting more immediate daily health problems ?
Fundamental questions about this new strain still need to be answered and its progress is very unpredictable .
But whatever course it takes , most countries which have already experienced bird flu and Sars have emerged from those crises far better equipped to deal with the next one .
