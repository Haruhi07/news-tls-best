First UK swine flu patient death Prof. John Oxford : ` ` We are preparing for a more severe outbreak in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE" value="2009-FA">Autumn</TIMEX3> ''
The swine flu virus has claimed its first victim in the UK , after a female patient died in a Scottish hospital .
The victim is understood to be a woman aged 38 who gave birth prematurely while being treated at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley .
The death is the first outside the Americas , where more than 140 people have died since the pandemic began .
Swine flu has <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> infected almost 500 people in Scotland alone , out of 1,261 cases in the UK .
The patient was one of 10 people being treated for swine flu in the greater Glasgow area .
A statement issued by the Scottish Government said : ` ` With regret , we can confirm that one of the patients who had been in hospital , and had been confirmed as suffering from the H1N1 virus , has died <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">today</TIMEX3> .
` ` The patient had underlying health conditions . ''
It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="SET" value="XXXX-WI" quant="EACH" freq="1S">each winter</TIMEX3> Fergus Walsh , BBC medical correspondent Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : ` ` I 'd like to express my condolences to the patient 's family and friends .
This is a tragedy for those concerned and they have my heartfelt sympathy .
` ` Tragic though <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-06-15">today</TIMEX3> 's death is , I would like to emphasise that the vast majority of those who have H1N1 are suffering from relatively mild symptoms . ''
The BBC 's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh said : ` ` Swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . ''
He added : ` ` It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="SET" value="XXXX-WI" quant="EACH" freq="1S">each winter</TIMEX3> .
The difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . ''
Thirty - five new cases of swine flu in Scotland were confirmed on <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-06-14">Sunday</TIMEX3> .
Together with 61 new cases in England and one case in Northern Ireland confirmed on <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE" value="2009-06-14">Sunday</TIMEX3> , a total of 1,261 people have <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> caught the virus in the UK .
Another 486 possible UK cases are being investigated .
Virologist Professor John Oxford said that despite the death , the public should not panic .
` ` I still think the chances of picking up the virus are remote .
It is not going to get any worse during <TIMEX3 tid="t12" type="DATE" value="2009-SU">the summer</TIMEX3> . ''
Professor Oxford said he did not think the the public had become complacent and said the country was well prepared in terms of anti - viral drugs .
The UK government outlined measures it has taken to combat the outbreak <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="2009-W25" mod="START">earlier this week</TIMEX3> .
Ministers urged people not to alter their normal behavior and follow hand hygiene guidelines .
