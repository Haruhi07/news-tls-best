Mary Hockaday | 17:45 UK time , <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">Wednesday</TIMEX3> , <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">29 April 2009</TIMEX3> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE" value="2009-W18">This week</TIMEX3> , one story has been prominent in our output : swine flu .
It 's a story which has involved our reporters in Mexico , the US , Europe , Scotland and the rest of the UK , plus our medical and science specialists .
And it has challenged us to think hard about our public service role on this kind of news story .

Essentially , our task is to give you the facts ; to tell you what we know , but also explore what is n't known ; to give you the best scientific and medical information and to inform but not to alarm .
There is a great deal of coverage in all the media which has led to a debate about whether the threat is being overplayed .
With any public health story , there 's a risk that raising awareness can raise concern .
We have sought at every step to report the science soberly and responsibly , with due weight given to the uncertainty of what will happen .
We know that audiences have many questions .
For the first couple of days , the comments and questions were coming in thick and fast , though they have <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> slowed .
The majority has been from the UK , but there are considerable numbers from Europe and the US too .
<TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">Yesterday</TIMEX3> , BBC Radio 5 Live did a phone - in , taking listeners ' questions about the outbreak 's impact and attempting to answer them using medical and travel experts .
Those contacting the network had a range of questions : ` ` My son 's <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DURATION" value="PT1H">an hour</TIMEX3> and a half from Mexico City - how exposed is he ? ''
` ` Are anti - viral drugs safe for pregnant women ? ''
` ` I ' m booked to go to Mexico on <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE" value="2009-04-30">30 April</TIMEX3> ; the airline wo n't let us cancel and get a refund , what are our options ? ''
To satisfy those members of our audience who ' ve been contacting our programs and website with questions , we put together a comprehensive Q&A .
In our <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> Have Your Say debate on the subject , many contributors have <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> said they believe that the government and media are over - reacting .
And World Have Your Say - the World Service global discussion program - was presented from the rooftop of a hotel in Mexico City <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> .
It asked its audience if the world was over - reacting to swine flu .
We heard from many , including Abdullah in Abuja who e - mailed to say that there really was no comparison between swine flu and the kind of diseases many African nations deal with on a daily basis .
There are voices raising important questions about media coverage of this virus .
Ben Goldacre - a medical doctor who writes the Bad Science blog - says that he 's been struck by the number of people contacting him to say ` ` Is swine flu just nonsense ? ''
and that the media is ` ` utterly '' mistrusted on its reporting of health issues .
Simon Jenkins , writing <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE" value="2009-04-29">today</TIMEX3> in the Guardian , has said the media has whipped up a panic in order to posture and spend .
So far , the balance we have been trying to achieve is to report what we know and , critically , what is n't known , using the science available - for instance from the Chief Medical Officer for England , Sir Liam Donaldson and the World Health Organization - as well as what respected scientists are telling us about the possible pattern of this illness .
At our editorial meetings , we have been regularly discussing how to get the approach , tone and use of pictures right , and to make sure that we offer our expertise and subject depth via our website .
Interestingly , the signs so far suggest that the public is not panicking - listeners contacting BBC Radio 1 's Newsbeat are showing a distinct shift in opinion .
<TIMEX3 tid="t18" type="DATE" value="2009-04-27">Two days ago</TIMEX3> , they were expressing serious concern , but <TIMEX3 tid="t19" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX3> - for many - it 's receding : ` ` Swine Flu has changed what I ' m doing .
I yawned at the last radio update .
I 'd probably not have done that if Swine Flu was n't mentioned . ''
This virus - and this story - may fade away , or it may grow .
At this point , as our correspondents are saying , we simply do n't know .
I hope that our reporting in <TIMEX3 tid="t27" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the past few days</TIMEX3> will help you make sense of what emerges in <TIMEX3 tid="t28" type="DURATION" value="PXD">the next few days</TIMEX3> , whichever way it develops .

Whilst I would never minimize the threat of swine fever , I watch BBB news to be informed ...
please do n't do a ` red - top tabloid on me .
Why is it sometimes called swine fever yet mainly referred to as swine flu ?

And yes , there is a fine line to be drawn between alerting the general public to the potential danger and encouraging panic .
A very difficult subject for a PSB .

I totally disagree with your view .

If like me you watched the news reports , as with the report I mentioned above , the correspondents frequently mention that very little have died , a priority figure , and as well as the comparisons made with seasonal flu death .
You may be cynical about the BBC reporting , but I see it informative , interesting , and responsible .

A school has closed in Paignton as a precaution .
Consider the impact of this one event - Parents will have to take time off work and\/or arrange childcare , Anti Social behavior may increase with hundreds of young people without positive activities to undertake .
The potential consequences of a pandemic are not purely the medical consequences , the economic impact alone could significantly exacerbate the effects of the <TIMEX3 tid="t68" type="DATE" value="PRESENT_REF">current</TIMEX3> recession .
Disruption to public services , transport , food distribution , access to money , power generation , water supplies , processing of state benefits etc etc . .
All of these processes and functions we take for granted
and they all involve people going to work .
This is the real danger posed by a potential pandemic , particularly to a society that relies so heavily on goods and services .
We as a country have become so reliant upon others for almost everything we need and the failure of this infrastructure is what the government fear the most .

The net effect is that you are reassuring people with the former , but implicitly alarming them with the latter .

Who knows or cares if swine ` flu virus is particularly virulent or the same as any other influenza ?

Schools will close for <TIMEX3 tid="t84" type="DURATION" value="P2W" mod="APPROX">about two weeks</TIMEX3> if an infection is identified , and we will be left wondering about those who contract the illness but do not even bother to report it because they do not know what they have .
In the meantime the placebo affect will have its way with many others .

Perhaps you need to fill some airtime by explaining the risk context .
Yes , the absolute risk on this occasion is probably small , but one of these days something will hit where the risk is massive and the consequences for the world potentially much more serious than you can imagine .
Therefore we need to be ultra - vigilant and if that involves crying wolf sometimes , so be it .

Mutation might occur naturally but not gene splicing !
` ` An influenza virus especially one genetically manipulated for increased virulence would be an attractive weapon for bioterrorists '' I can understand -LRB- although not approve -RRB- of the general scaremongering amongst tabloids and commercial news channels .
Unfortunatley , they require sensationalism to sell their stories and gain viewers .
I do n't see why the BBC has to join in the media frenzy for that reason .
There are no advertisers to please or sales to present , a full coverage of daily news is what I require and pay for , not a single story .
The difference in mortalities in epidemic and in pandemic influenza is a factor of ten .
Epidemic influenza regularly ` ` accelerates '' the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people <TIMEX3 tid="t124" type="SET" value="P1Y" quant="EVERY">every year</TIMEX3> .
The viral mutations make it difficult to control or inhibit .
Anti - viral drugs have not been tested for effectiveness across large populations where mortality may be expected to be high .
It is almost impossible to give accurate figures for the number of deaths wholly caused by the virus as compared to deaths assisted by the virus .
Influenza spreads very quickly and easily .
Even with a double handed protective cup against a sneeze the viral aerosol is sufficient to reach ten or maybe twenty people on a closely packed bus , coach , train or aircraft .
All of these people will carry the virus and some will suffer the symptoms of illness at varying levels .
One or two may become quite ill , whilst others may experience <TIMEX3 tid="t135" type="DURATION" value="P1D">a day</TIMEX3> or so of discomfit .
Some will experience no illness at all apart from sneezes or coughs which spread the attack still further .
Deaths may occur with very young children or infirm elderly from complications e.g. pneumonia .
The genetic manipulation of viruses similar in activity to influenza is a potent way to disable population groups and cause high numbers of deaths .
It is almost impossible to secure against influenza even through vaccination .
There are vaccines and treatments for almost everything that afflicts Africa .
There are vaccines for meningitis , cholera and malaria ; there are mitigating therapies for HIV disease .
There are cheap water filters in the world that would make cholera non - existent .
What there is no known treatment for is the corruption of African leaders , bureaucrats and middlemen who make fortunes for themselves out of every aid effort organised from outside Africa .
It is up to the diverse populations of Africa to do what has been done by other populations that have known great misery & affliction : organise themselves to get rid of the worst corrupt elements and install reasonably functional people in positions of authority .
This has already been demonstrated to bring some relief in countries such as Brazil , Russia , India , and China , not to mention Pakistan or Indonesia .
The number of suffering regions in the world is indeed great , but only diligent effort by sufferers themselves actually leads to effective improvements in local , regional and national governance .
History proves there are no short - cuts to this process .
The problem with the H1N1 alarm has to do in part with the possibility that in Mexico a second and potentially even a third set of factors complicate health security .
The very nature of this puzzle becomes a compelling driver for unraveling the knots in the story , so that we can not only deal with the problem , but also understand more and prepare better for a potentially fraught future .
For as long as Africans look to the affluent societies for assistance , they will need to accept that threats to the richer countries also imply worsening conditions in Africa .
Please understand that most people in the US are in fact living hand - to - mouth , day - to - day ; there are plenty of Americans whose life circumstances are no different from average wage - earning Africans ' , and these people are indeed at risk :
the 2 % -5 % of Americans -LRB- I am only using US as an example because it is next door to Mexico & essentially there is an open border between the two countries -RRB- who are indeed so wealthy they appear to be invincible to others -LRB-
and of course they are anything but -RRB- represent a tiny minority living in a cocoon .
It is wrong of people in Africa to lump other kinds of people into a single pot of ` ` the rich we are entitled to resent '' , just as it is wrong for people in prosperous countries to dismiss this looming pandemic as ` ` a problem for the low - caste people who do n't really matter much and so what . ''
Every serious health crisis humans face , including all the problems complicating life for Africans , links back to a problem with population .
Reckless procreation -LRB- and no , I do not mean accidental pregnancies that befall very young people out of naivete , but rather the deliberate intention , through marriage and polygamy and conscious promiscuity by African males -RRB- to beget as many souls as possible exacerbates all problems .
When in times of famine grown people insist on conceiving new children only to watch them die in agony , over and over again , the chance of finding effective solutions for the diseases that plague malnourished and immunity - depressed populations withers on the vine .
Any married person knows that it is not necessary even to have available contraceptive devices , instructions , medicines or treatments to regulate the frequency of children being conceived .
All that is really required to have a reasonable number of offspring -LRB- and for some people ` reasonable ' might mean Zero -RRB- is common sense , a little reason , a good heart and some self - control .
There are many ways to be close and happy together that do not involve creating new people or risking infections .
Every nation and even every family that has ever advanced in life has done so because it exerted great effort , even in the face of dreadful odds .
Japan overcame the horrors of Hiroshima & Nagasaki .
The list of other awful tragedies is long , and you know it .
When people stop making excuses and blaming others , and get busy working out what they do indeed personally control that they can through personal dedication change , suddenly everything becomes a lot easier to accomplish .

Another dimension is that of pharmaceutical companies promotional activities .
Anti viral drug stocks only sell when they are used or when bought by health organizations oftimes only to lie in their stocks unused until out of date and eventually thrown in the bin at cost to the public purse .
A pandemic scare is a great sales advert for the manufacturers of drugs just as a war provides sales opportunity for arms manufacturers .

The word pandemic has been associated with killer viruses like SARS which was a killer for most of those who contacted it so to spread fear on the basis of such scant information was questionable .
The virus must have entered this country before the publicity so many could have already contracted it thinking it was an ordinary flu virus .
They have obviously recovered or we would have known about it .
In the main it is not the public who have panicked it is the WHO who seem to have been waiting for something to happen and indeed justify their existance and predictions .
Let 's hope that if something worse comes along in the future they will not have jeopodised their credibility whereby no - one takes any notice of them .
The fuss being made over ` ` swine flue '' seems to be disproportionate , but has n't it come along at a convenient time for world leaders , what a marvellous distraction to blind people to the recession ?

How many ` ` confirmed '' -LRB- and unconfirmed -RRB- cases of HIV ?
To me it seems like a very , very distorted perspective , even if -LRB- and only if -RRB- the Swine Flu might spread easier than HIV and to more -LRB- richer -RRB- parts of the world than Malaria ...
As far as I can tell from the news , both Malaria and HIV are deadlier -LRB- if not medicated -RRB- than the Swine Flu ?

Where the BBC has a part to play is in being more discriminating about which of these claims it decides to publish and how prominently they feature on the site .
Anyone can set themselves up as a ` researcher ' and put out a press release nowadays , and hence the currency of the ` expert ' has been hugely devalued .
Just Google MeMe Roth whose grandly - titled ` National Action Against Obesity ' is run from a back bedroom , and yet the American media fawn over her as though she really is the ` president ' of this hugely influential organization .
The BBC is probably unique in that it can afford to employ people in its health department who actually have some knowledge of the issues under discussion rather than relying on press releases paraphrased by overworked journalists .

And yet I trust its health output about as far as that of the Daily Mail , with which the top stories are frequently -LRB- and disconcertingly -RRB- interchangeable .

I am not an expert , however , when organizations such as the WHO repeatedly over - inflate the risks , then I become cynical , as it seems do most of the posters to this blog .
As for the BBC reporting on this swine flu outbreak , it has been thus far reasonable , keep up the good work .
I am a little confused about the attacks on WHO information which reaches us via the media NOT directly from the Organisation itself .
Any spin is applied -LRB- censored , edited etc -RRB- before it is released to us , not only afterwards .
If one wishes to compare and contrast media manipulation of data released by WHO then inquire as to why the media have perpetuated ` ` passive smoking '' myths when WHO are amongst the few who say '' -LRB- passive smoking -RRB- does not exist as a measurable risk '' .
When , however , requested to estimate the risk of a particularly unpleasant influenza strain -LRB- e.g. avian ` flu
-RRB- what the WHO actually said is that ` ` if the virus mutates the ability to jump person to person '' we face a potentially high mortality rate , possibly in hundreds of millions '' .
That was accurate science reported by most media inaccurately .
The problem with Type A influenza is that , in common with almost any infection , it is deaths that make news first , not the numbers who contract the virus and recover .
If just one person survives a ` flu -LRB- epi - or pandemic -RRB- attack then we have the anti - bodies and potential survival .

In the case of Type A for all we know there are millions of Mexicans -LRB- etc -RRB- who have recovered and survived without the use of Tamiflu or any other anti - viral medicine .
Healthy people can withstand virus attacks in 99.999 % of cases .
So please do not enter into a argument about responsible journalism , irresponsible WHO .
No such animal as responsible journalism is alive and kicking in the west at the present time .
Even the BBC is in a competition to be ` ` best '' and that is sad .

This is the only official information to this point .
The Mexican government is working directly with the WHO and CDC and they are handling the same data .

IPHF warns against politicizing and sensationalizing of the H1N1 Virus Dr. Francis Ohanyido the President of the International Public Health Forum -LRB-
IPHF -RRB- has warned the media and public officials to be careful about the way they portray the H1N1 virus aka swine flu .
Answering questions on the evolving pandemic in Abuja <TIMEX3 tid="t351" type="DATE" value="2009-04-28">yesterday</TIMEX3> , the IPHF boss admonished against unnecessary sensationalism of the issue by the media and advised journalists to give the public accurate information that can assist in mitigating the spread .
He also reacted to statements by public officers like US Vice - President Joe Biden that was credited to have advised Americans against some forms of transportation .
He advised that whenever possible notable figures should endeavor to have a perspective of WHOs global and public health posture on such issues before making categorical statements .
The Forum is wholly in support of the direction , drive and leadership of the WHO , and agrees with Keiji Fukuda , Assistant Director - General of the UN Health body the epidemiological picture is still evolving and heightened vigilance and improved reporting structure is critical , especially in view of the sustained human transmission that has so far been seen particularly in Mexico and other countries .
He further advised that the term H1N1 should be used rather than the swine flu which is to some extent misleading a lot of people into the impression that the flu is actively being spread by pigs or circulating amongst them .
In this sense , he reiterated that the case is not exactly the same as experienced with the H5N1 -LRB-

` ` Ohanyido further called upon countries challenged by resources to make great effort to ensure that a pandemic response system in line with WHO recommendation is in place , so as to reduce possible cost profile in the case of a wider pandemic escalating to Level 6 . ''
It is worth noting that WHO have also clearly stated that Level 6 does not indicate the likelihood of infection nor the severity of the illness -LRB-
or therefore the mortality rate -RRB-
but does reflect the area of the globe affected by the infection .
The higher the number the more countries with confirmed cases .

<TIMEX3 tid="t357" type="DURATION" value="PXD">A few days</TIMEX3> ago I heard one of you news readers on News 24 use these words , ` ` Swine flu is sweeping across the world '' .
At the time there were fewer than 150 confirmed cases in the whole world .
How can that be considered to be ` ` Sweeping across the world '' ?
Please keep your language under control when dealing with an event like this flu epidemic .
Some of the information given has so far been extremely helpful and I think the BBC has done an excellent job of keeping the public calm .
However I do think that saying that Swine Flu is ` ` sweeping '' across the world is more than a slight exaggeration with only very few confirmed cases .
Although I do think its worthwhile to take tamiflu as a precautionary measure .
Especially those most vulnerable , like myself with a heart condition -LRB-
I ' ve got a Metal Aortic Valve -RRB- .
Its beneficial to prevent and fight the new flu virus , so its definitely worth taking .

I was thefore incensed by your editorial decision to invite Kelvin McKenzie to comment on the efforts being made by the health authorities to contain the outbreak on <TIMEX3 tid="t379" type="TIME" value="2009-04-29TMO">this morning</TIMEX3> 's breakfast program as plain daft .
Politics aside , what can that man possibly know about how the virus can spread and the best way of controlling it is beyond me .
Remarks like : ' The teaching staff have got another week off on full pay and the kids have stopped taking their Tamiflu and are walking around the local town center as the school is shut spreading their germs ' -LRB- does he know that for a fact ?
-RRB- I suppose is only to be expected from him .
It is a shame that he has not been to Mexico <TIMEX3 tid="t380" type="DATE" value="PAST_REF">recently</TIMEX3> .
So I guess you ` ` know '' that the BBC has consulted learned medical experts before it ships out its own brand of ` ` facts and figures '' ?
The facts is we know an awful lot about type A influenza because it has been around quite a long time and most of the UK population has suffered at least one dose of it .
One of the things we may not understand is that dosing people up with Tamiflu and trying to limit spread are actually playing into the hands of future pandemics because the crucial factor in influenza is the production of antibodies by the would be host .
People will die because of type A influenza infection , so called swine variant or not .
That is a fact of life and one of the risks that have to be taken to ensure that the majority have the capacity to produce antibodies that will mitigate against future variants .
What we should expect of our media is balanced reporting and if that requires both ` ` right '' and ` ` left '' wing variants of ` ` facts '' then so be it .

The headline very clear makes claim to a causal effect - it provokes readers through making them think that the girl died \ * because \ * of swine flu .
Yet later the article goes on to admit that it was completely unknown if swine flu contributed to her death , and that the girl actually ` had other serious health problems ' .
How does this fit into your claim that you are here ` to inform but not to alarm ' ?
The headline was a clear example of attempting to alarm people , regardless of the facts .
Your claim that the public are not panicking would seem to be that they are not panicking despite extensive efforts on behalf of the media , including the BBC .
Headlines should not be written to distort the known facts simply to drive up audience figures ...

it would be more useful to have media estimates of the Actual Global Presence and Absense in places .
For instance it was shocking to hear from friends that Dubai Airport was full of sick people -LRB- 2009\/early08 -RRB- .
As such I ' ve choosen Singapore for a cross - over - flight I will be taking in <TIMEX3 tid="t408" type="DURATION" value="P1M">a months</TIMEX3> time .
It 's shocking in several aspects ... 1 .
that this is mouth to mouth knowledge ... and 2 .
that this is n't knowledge reported on in the media . .
and also inteligently reported on ... like perhaps it is just flu season in Arabia , with other common flus being present and not swine flu .
Also the media should provide other intelligence , such as whether successful vaccines are present ... and whether these have world - wide distribution .
Damn the comments on local coverages and spreads per country and their supposed hype ...
the media is still and should primarily be for good international inteligence to people who through inteligent design of thier own plans can actually curb Global Spread of what could be a serious global epidemic At 08:49 <TIMEX3 tid="t410" type="DATE" value="2009-08-25">25th Aug 2009</TIMEX3> , livingAndy747 wrote : MORE MONEY FOR THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES !

This is a criminal conspiracy on the part of the Pharmaceutical industry , though I doubt if the politicians are directly involved : they are so scientifically illiterate that they are suckers for anything like this , but of course it helps that they 're paying with someone else 's money .
Far more people will die from the side effects of the vaccines than would have died from swine flu , and many millions across continents will have their immune systems impaired permanently , resulting in huge increases in the incidence of rheumatic ailments , asthma , possibly autism - all grist to the mill of the medical priesthood and their suppliers , of course .
Please understand , everyone - it is to the financial advantage of both the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry to have a chronically sick , totally medicalised population , and we are talking many billions of pounds , euros , dollars or whatever .
These people want and need you sick : just think about it - you know it makes sense .
