'' \nHis study suggests swine flu could kill four in every 1,000 infected people . \nProfessor Ferguson said his findings confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production . \n`` We really need to be prepared , particularly for the autumn . \nAt the moment , the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere , because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic . \n`` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus ? \nI think those decisions need to be made quickly .

'' \nThe detailed scientific work is being done at GSK 's plant in Belgium , while executives in London negotiate global contracts . \nHealth experts are monitoring H1N1 cases in countries like Brazil , where winter and normal `` seasonal '' flu is just beginning . \nProfessor Ab Osterhaus , who is based in Rotterdam , has studied flu viruses for half of his 30-year career , and predicts various tensions in the months ahead . \nHe said : `` If you start to produce the pandemic flu vaccine , it will go at the cost of the seasonal flu vaccine . \n`` Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the world every year - so we still have a responsibility there as well . \nIf we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures `` The production capacity is limited , and vaccines have to be produced within six months . \n`` There is likely to be competition between countries . \n`` The richer countries have ordered pre-pandemic vaccine . \nThat is not the case for countries that do n't have so many resources . \n`` So if we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures . \n`` It 's a major issue for the World Health Organisation to consider . '' \nThe Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , has warned that H1N1 may be spreading in the community - despite efforts to contain it among known travellers and their contacts . \nPrevious pandemics have started in a mild fashion , but developed in waves . \nYou wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf And although the figures do not now lead news bulletins , the number of swine flu cases continues to rise each day . \nAfter the initial flurry of coverage , questions were raised about whether the threat posed by H1N1 had been over-hyped . \nThat is firmly denied by the health editor of the Independent newspaper , Jeremy Laurance , who wrote a strident front-page piece a month ago . \nHe told me : `` People say there are only two kinds of medical story - the miracle cure and the deadly scare . \n`` You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf . \n`` I felt there was a real need to answer that charge - and that 's why I wrote the piece I did . \n`` This is a wholly new virus that we have n't seen before . \n`` And it 's estimated a third of the world 's population wo n't have immunity to it . \n`` That 's why we need to take it seriously . '' \nAnd in the meantime , the NHS is learning lessons . \nA leading light in the BMA doctors ' union , Dr Jonathan Fielden , works in intensive care at a busy hospital in the Home Counties . \nDr Fielden said : `` We had a case of concern which led us to ensure we had special masks which were properly fitted . \n`` They give a higher level of protection than the masks we use in theater . \n`` So far , it 's been a useful test of our procedures , in circumstances where the flu has n't been severe at this stage . \n`` Our concern , as we come to the normal flu season in the winter , is that many of our resources are already under pressure . \n`` Although there 's been an increase in intensive care beds , we still have some of the lowest numbers in Europe per head of population . \n`` Those beds are often under great stress in normal circumstances - and in these circumstances , there will be pressure throughout the system .

When my colleagues and I went to film in Tiananmen Square last Friday , we were stopped four times by the police -LRB- normally we 're checked just once . -RRB- \nOfficers told us that we were not allowed to use our camera tripod to do any filming - something we 've never been told before . \nIn the embassy district in eastern Beijing , Chinese guards are currently wearing flak jackets or stab vests over their uniforms - something that I have n't seen before , and I 've walked past these guards almost every day for the last two years . \nWhen a colleague of mine mentioned Tiananmen Square during a mobile phone conversation , a Chinese voice interrupted his call for a few seconds . \nWe get The Economist magazine mailed to our office every week . \nThe most recent edition arrived with a page torn out of it -LRB- The contents page shows that the missing page contained an article about the Tiananmen Square anniversary . -RRB- \nIf you 're in China , have you noticed anything similar ?

S ? \nWhile the Euro-centric countries can point fingers at China for what China did on June 4th 1989 , if the same thing happened in their countries , they would do the exactly same as the Chinese

Europe as that 's where most of them ended up days after June 4th 1989 ? \n20 years later , as if it never happened ... because it was only significant to fewer than handful of Chinese when you look at the entire population of China and if you have just a little cultural knowledge about China . \nHowever , it is MOST significant for Euro-centric countries that want to utilize it for material

'' \nAnd while chickenpox or rubella parties were once popular as these illnesses are more straight-forward in childhood , swine flu is in a different league , warns Professor Oxford . \nChickenpox can be fatal - but that is rare Although chickenpox can be fatal - that is rare . \nDangerous complications can happen in a small number of healthy children or those with other chronic health problems . \nPeople have died from swine flu and less is known about the current strain . \nHealth authorities do n't yet know enough about it to predict how it will affect individuals , how it will mutate and whether it will come back . \nThe effects have so far been less dramatic than initially feared - Mexico has scaled back its death toll from 159 to 56 , and precautions such as school closures seem to have slowed its spread . \nBut it has `` full pandemic potential '' , the World Health Organization says . \nA pandemic occurs when a new flu virus appears against which we have no immunity , resulting in outbreaks worldwide . \nAlready cases have been confirmed in 30 countries , from Mexico to New Zealand , Canada to Thailand , Germany to the UK . \n`` What 's reassuring is that the UK has stockpiles of antiviral drugs , enough to treat those who contract swine flu or who are exposed to it , and to protect frontline medical staff , '' says Professor Oxford . \n`` My daughter 's a GP . \nIf -LRB- swine flu -RRB- takes off and people come in to see her , she can take it prophylatically , one tablet a day for six weeks . '' \nA regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? \naims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines And although swine flu is a new virus , our bodies encounter other strains of H1N1 in the seasonal flu that does the rounds each year . \n`` We 're not as vulnerable as we were in 1957 's pandemic , which was a totally new virus . \nWe 've come into contact with distant relatives of swine flu before . \nIf you catch it , your body will say ' I know this family , I 've fought off its cousin , six times removed ' and go to work to fight it off . '' \nPrior exposure , through seasonal flu or swine flu vaccination when one becomes available , prompts the immune system to produce suitable antibodies to fight off the invader . \n`` And once exposed , you have lifetime memory of those antibodies and can produce them again , '' says Professor Oxford . \n"}
{"id": "558", "time": "2009-04-25", "text": "Susan Watts | 18:00 UK time , Saturday , 25 April 2009 Experts are clearly extremely concerned about the new swine flu virus which the World Health Organisation warned today has the potential to cause a pandemic . \nThe virus has killed at least 60 people in Mexico and appears to have infected more than 1,000 . \nThe same virus also appears to be behind infections in Texas and California , with suspected cases reportedly being tested in New York . \nDr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre in London , told me this afternoon that we must take this seriously : `` It looks pretty ominous , one has to say . \nIt 's difficult to look on the bright side at the moment . '' \nHe stressed , though , that it 's still early days , there 's a lot we do n't know and he does n't want to be alarmist . \nWhat 's most worrying is that this new virus is affecting young , healthy adults - the same group affected by the pandemic flu virus of 1918 . \nThose usually vulnerable to flu , the elderly and the very young , were at less risk then and , it appears , now . \nAccording to Dr Hay this is key in trying to assess the likelihood of this virus causing a pandemic : `` That was the unusual feature about 1918 , it was the healthy young adults that suffered most ... and I think everybody understands the implications , '' he said . \nHe described the situation in Mexico as `` totally different '' from the intermittent cases of H5N1 bird flu among people , because it appears to be spreading so fast . \nSporadic bird flu infections in people have alerted the world to the possibility of a pandemic , but Dr Hay said this H1 swine flu virus is `` already worse than H5 '' , in terms of `` the number of cases , the number of deaths and the locality of the area affected ... This is n't sporadic , this is human '' . \nDr Hay stressed that it may turn out that the situation is less alarming than it appears now , but this will be hard to assess until experts know clinical details of the cases in Mexico , such as the length of time from infection to death . \nDr Hay 's laboratory in north London expects to receive samples from the new cases next week , via the US Centers for Disease Control . \nHis team can then help to advise on the best possible vaccine . \nAlready , his team and others around the world are working on a fast diagnostic test so that labs likely to see new cases can confirm whether or not people have the virus , as soon as possible . \nSpeed will be of the essence in containing infections . \nThere are eight genes in the flu virus . \nAccording to Dr Hay , this new one has six genes from swine flu viruses already known to have been circulating in the US , and two from swine flu viruses from Europe and Asia . \nThe US swine flu virus genes in this new virus are themselves mixtures of swine flu , bird flu and human flu viruses - what 's described as a classic `` re-assortment '' - a combination feared most by those watching for a flu pandemic . \nExperts around the world have been warning for years that this is inevitable . \nThe last pandemic was in 1968 and killed around a million people worldwide . \nThe next few days and weeks will be crucial . \nOne possibly hopeful sign is that of the eight cases in the US there has been only one hospitalisation , and no deaths . \nSo it may turn out that there is some other kind of infection at work in Mexico , as well as the new flu virus . \nAt 12:19 26th Apr 2009 , barriesingleton wrote : This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \nAt 13:18 26th Apr 2009 , Jim213 wrote : This comment was removed because the moderators found it broke the house rules . \nThank you Susan , keep it coming . \nOf course , it 's not like the media to blow things out of proportion is it ?

'' \nOn Thursday , an entire school district in Texas was closed down as a precaution and 80,000 children were sent home . \nThe first death in the US also happened in this state . \nA hundred miles east of El Paso , in the tiny town of Fort Hancock , there are no high security fences and security cameras . \nLike much of the border between the US and Mexico , there are plenty of places to cross , albeit illegally . \n`` We 're not out here 24\\/7 , '' says Deputy Sheriff Robert Wilson , who patrols the border as part of his duties . \n`` There 's no way to monitor folks if they decide to cross from Mexico to the United States and if someone was infected with the disease then they would enter into the United States undetected . '' \nThe situation here is evolving rapidly , but there is also a measured calm . \nPeople on both sides of the border are concerned , and perhaps a little frustrated , that more information is not being given out . \nBut there is also a need , primarily driven by basic economics , for Mexicans and Americans to keep on crossing this and other borders . \nMexico City , to many , feels like a distant place . \nBut as schools close and the number of confirmed cases inevitably rises , it is getting closer . \n"}

COME ON PEOPLE ! \nHow do you think you catch colds anyway ? \nWash your hands more ... sneeze into tissues , catch it bin it , kill it ! . . \nup your hand hygiene if worried buy hand gel cleaners but do n't over use and definitely do n't use when smoking after all its alcohol based !! Just shut ports borders and airports , simple answer yes trade would suffer but would reduce the risk tenfold . \nIt 's the quality of life that matters not the quantity and dying from swine flu is probably no worse or better than dying from other diseases . \nAt least if we are all supposedly dead we wo n't have to watch the world go to hell in a handbasket and have to listen to terrible media hyperbole anymore . \nEvery cloud has a silver lining . \nMy concern is cross contamination through supermarket basket\\/trolly handles and yet on checking , with various supermarket head offices I have n't found one store in England that has implemented a deep cleansing routine or even offered disinfecting wipes out to their customers when entering their stores . \nNo wonder we all catch flu these days . \n` Flu is not the bubonic plague where mortality is around 50 % . \nThe best way to avoid any viral infection is to stay at home and let it pass . \nTrouble is employers would take a dim view of that . \nIt will get us in the end . \nI do n't see how the health secretary can say it is being `` confined , contained and treated '' . \nI do n't see that it is being contained if there are cases of people who have caught the virus by contact with people who have been to Mexico . \nPeople who have traveled to affected areas should have remained in isolation . \nSchools are not closed if a pupil has not been symptomatic yet the first man to catch the virus who had not traveled appears to have done so through a carrier who had traveled to Mexico but was not displaying symptoms . \nIt seems to me that the authorities are just accepting the inevitable and allowing it to spread but are unwilling to say so . \nI do n't understand the necessity to close schools & then for parents to possibly transmit the virus at work , or for brothers\\/sisters in other schools to also possibly spread the virus . \nIf there is serious threat to health , and to have any serious effect in stopping the spread , then surely whole families should be quarantined & not just parts of it . \nPresent policy is nonsensical , non practical , and unrealistic with stopping any pandemic . \nBut then again we are used to half hearted non-sensical policies from this negligent inept government . \nThank you to the government for a measured response , sensible information and good forward planning . \nHopefully this is a mild outbreak and the death rate will be the same as or even less than normal flu . \nBut that is still additional deaths and there is still the potential for an autumn out break . \nYes there has been media hype - it is what sells papers ! \n- but the reality is that if we had taken this approach with other viruses then many lives would have been saved . \nThe UK focus now must be on maintaining sensible precautions and looking to help countries less able than us to manage an outbreak . \nWhat is the WHO alert level of seasonal flu ? \nIt would be interesting to know as a comparison - might help put things into context\\/rationalise this new threat ! \nThe Swine flu pandemic has brought a lot of anxiety for many people especially some of us in the Developing countries . \nWe depend on you people from the developed countries to share with us the symptoms and the precaution to be taken if we are faced with the same . \nPaul Kuyela Kolala , Ndola , Zambia How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? \nJust by constant education by those who know how to deal with this virus . \nStop the sensationalist journalism . \nThe gist of what you have been reporting in the last week is `` 15 people caught the flu in the UK and they are now recovering from it '' ! \nThat 's all there is to it . \nIs that really first page news ? \nIf you 're gonna get it , you will . \nIt 's obvious what to do . \nIsolate those who do have it , and give meds to every household . \nThat will prove if we really were prepared . \nIn history there have always been periods of mass infection and disease . \nWe are human after all , so we ca n't avoid it . \nIf Swine Flu does n't get us then there 'll be another one along soon . \nFirstly by ignoring hyped press - As a nurse I know we have a good infrastructure-however when people are directed to A&E or to just to the pharmacy you wonder who is paying attention . \nI want to know if in Birmingham the plane was grounded and cleaned from those passengers carrying the virus-small things like this count-planes are invariable landed quick cleaned and out again which potentially infects more people . \nI agree with most of the comments that have been posted on this page . \nI can not believe how far this ` flu ' has been blown out of proportion . \nStop wearing masks that do nothing and continue with normal civilized life !!! I would stop all flights and travel abroad to contain this spread The World Health Organization rightly says countries must not lower their guard in the response to the swine flu outbreak . \nThe only way to avoid catching a virus is to stop breathing - the consequences of that however are far more serious . \nThe WHO have no authority over the flu virus , if you catch it then rest , have plenty to drink , look after yourself . \nStop panicking and get on with life . \nWith the overwhelming number of cases here in Britain I fear it is far too late . \nAll we can do is sit back and watch as the numbers increase to 100 or more . \nToo late and resulting in needless cases of mild flu . \nPeople , come to Mexico and do n't be afraid of the flu , or of Mexicans . \nI just got back from a tour of Northern Mexico , and I heard of 2 cases of flu in all of northern Mexico . \nTwo cases , and northern Mexico is bigger than France . \nCome on , what 's the deal ? \nif you want problems walk around Detroit at 3am John Paul Cline , Guadalajara , Mexico Hey , what do you know ? \nSwine flu has not been as bad as the media and government wanted us to believe , but do n't stop panicking , because it could get worse again in the autumn !! Another over-blown scare from a government trying to take our sights off the economy and the mess they are in . \nThe best way to avoid it is to steer well clear of the source i.e news media . \nSwine flu is like normal flu only milder , yet you would think it was The Plague by the way it has been blown all out of proportion . \nI 'm sorry for the 900 , but 900 out of five continents , God only knows how many billions of people , hardly constitutes a `` pandemic '' . \nAs other articles point out , five or more orders of magnitude more people die EVERY YEAR from normal seasonal flu . \nSo this is a major media hyperbole pork non-event . \nShame on the broadcasters . \nWash your hands and get on with life . \nIf the media did n't report on daily or weekly news , we would know nothing at all , we would all be sneezing and spluttering on everyone , none of you can say you have n't took their words into advice and made a little more effort over this , fair enough they sell more papers but we buy them regardless . \nIf it was n't for the media scaring us a lot of the human race would carry on coughing in any direction you walked in . \nJust stop it BBC . \nStop with this race to find the next bogeyman to scare us with . \nYou and the rest of the media , you may have noticed this time that more and more people are failing to fall for this shtick , and the more you delve into speculation and scarifying the more eroded your once-great reputation becomes . \nSwine flu has come along at just the right time for us all to forget about MPs ' expenses and the failing economy ... How convenient ! \nI know Tories want to blame everything on Gordon Brown but get real a mild -LRB- ish -RRB- version of flu starting in Mexico that has got to be Brown 's fault . \nThe reality is around 10,000 die each Year in the UK as a result of flu infections and the excessive concentration on this virus by the media is only likely to result , given finite production capacity , in vaccinations being produced in lower quantities for the likely winter virus . \nPS BBC sort your system out its been 3 days now . \nI believe the WHO is correct in all its assertions . \nThey are a research organization put in place by the government to inform , study , control , and treat all health related topics . \nWe as a public need to be cognisant of all the information given and do as instructed and follow all information given for ourselves our families and everyone . \nI am glad all information including scientific research information has been given freely to the public . \nWe need to escape the last 5 years of governmental silence in which no one was informed of anything . \nWe have two cases of swine flu in our town outside of Chicago and I am not worried at all . \nBoth of the people , a 12 year old , and a 25 year old , were treated and are recovering quickly . \nThis whole thing is just media food to scare us . \nThis is just a diversion from the economic problems . \nPeople die from the flu every year , what 's the big deal . \nPlease report on who is stealing all our money . \nWhy all this `` Scare and hype tactics '' around a regular influenza virus ? \nWe have approx 41 million people world wide with HIV , 3000 people die every day from malaria and here we have an a minute fraction of the world 's population with a `` flu '' virus and yet again the WHO and media outlets try to create massive profits for the pharmaceutical industries by adding fuel to a minute out break of flu . \nPlease get this in perspective and desist from creating unnecessary panic . \nCharts showing the spread of the disease did indeed confirm how easy it was to invade populations . \nReasonable precautions taken have had a good result . \nDo n't pooh-pooh the containment as proof that measures were unnecessary . \nBut the real test comes down the road to see if the `` bug '' mutates further in the fall . \nI personally think that its just a regular cold . \nAll the symptoms have an explanation other than swine flu . \nWe have no reason to think its anything other than the common cold , with maybe a few small changes . \nI do n't know a whole lot about it , and I 'm not some brilliant doctor , but all my friends are basically competing for `` person most likely to have swine flu . '' \nOne of the teachers will send you home with the slightest cough or if you lay your head on the desk . \nIt 's no big deal . \nWe are also hurting Mexico . \nWe 're blaming it on them and now no one will go there for a while . \nI think its stupid . \nPandemic - do n't make me laugh . \nA couple of hundred suspected cases and only a hand full of fatalities proven to be caused by swine flu . \nIf the governments and health organizations have finished trying to scare everyone can we please get back to real issues . \nCough into a hankie . \nEveryone take care of their own hygiene and everything will be fine . \nAnd the media should stop scaring everyone !!! No one can tell in which way a virus is going to evolve in advance . \nThis strain of H1N1 has turned out to be just like a normal flu - for the moment - but it could just as equally become deadly to humans , simply due to an unlucky mutation . \nSo , instead of criticising the media and the governments for informing the public and taking preventive measures against such a potential threat to human lives , maybe we should be glad that there is enough transparency in the media and that politicians are willing to take action for our health first - not always for the health of the economy . \nDo you think it is possible for swine flu to be transmitted through the air system on aircraft , as I understand the air is internally circulated - so many people come back from holidays with chesty colds ? \nFifteen out of fifty nine thousand have got swine flu . \nWe seem to have one new case every day . \nHardly evidence of an imminent flu pandemic . \nOf all the viruses that have caused mayhem and havoc , Norovirus is the most problematic . \nIt has caused more infections than flu . \nJust ask the cruise lines ! \nActually I 'm quite glad that the fact that flu passes from one person to another is no longer dominating the headlines . \nWhatever would we all do without the media to report bad science and whip up unnecessary panic ?? I think they should change `` swine flu '' to just `` flu '' , it seems no worse than seasonal flu . \nDo n't avoid it . \nIt is a weak flu -LRB- all flu 's kill , but this one not many -RRB- and it might give you immunity to a deadlier H1N1 that is yet to come . '' \n`` The WHO have cried wolf . \nThe next time they issue another pandemic alert , nobody will believe them . '' '' \nI 'm going to stop buying their records ... ... Could this whole thing be a distraction to get our minds off the economic situation ? \nJust wondering ... I have noticed recently that a large portion of the BBC ` News ' is given over to speculation : Bird Flu wiping out humanity ; extreme weather due in thirty years as a result of global warming ; running out of oil ; worst recession since 1920s etc. etc. . \nShould n't you just stick to reporting on what has happened ? \nWhat a panic over nothing . \nA relatively mild flu virus has broken out in several countries - and apparently it is enough to bring the world to a grinding halt . \nSome perspective is needed . \nI probably wont get it . \nIf I do , I will have mild cold\\/flu like symptoms . \nThe media storm however is causing panic , has already caused a great deal of damage to Mexico , and could cause a great deal of damage here , at a time when we are fragile economically as it is . \nThe question is , in whose interests is it that we are afraid . \nAlan Davies interview this morning was scaremongering . \nThe best way to avoid a swine flu pandemic here in the UK - would be to get rid of the current government as fast as possible . \nThen maybe their spin doctors might not have to work so hard to distract the populous from the social disintegration they have caused by their greed . \nI remember reading about the 1918 epidemic several years back . \nI recall the records that indicated alcoholics had a high survival rate . \nCould it be that alcohol has the effect of combating the virus . \nIf we could refine the connection and perhaps find an antiseptic just as effective and less dangerous to our overall health than alcohol . \nWhen we are facing such a crisis it 's any port in a storm . \nGrampa Borley So much fuss over a natural method of population control . \nIt 's sickening to see all this hulabaloo over a minor flu when thousands are being infected with the HIV virus every day . \nWake up to the real problem BBC and stop sensationalising . \nTalk about hype - it 's the media whipping the world into a frenzy for they have little else to stir up at the moment . \nIt 's like the Kentucky Derby , increase hype and frenzy for two days , and then it is all over in sixty seconds . \nGet real everyone and stop panicking over nothing . \nWhat a surprise BBC panicking the world and causing major problems to Mexico 's tourist industry by printing stories telling people not to go to Mexico . \nShould they be issuing a rather large apology to the world . \nUm yes I think so ... How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? \nStop reading the papers . \nThis flu is a load of rubbish the government is playing with us . \nWhat 's baffling me is news that the ` flu is being contained , but every day another person is affected . \nA look at the world map defies that it 's being contained at all . \nNot scare-mongering , but am extremely worried . \nPreventing contact with infected individuals is key to preventing a pandemic outbreak . \nAnyone who thinks this has been ` over hyped ' must n't realize how significant it is when a never before seen virus mutates to infect humans . \nThis virus did n't exist 3 months ago , it is brand new , and considered a mild strain . \nWhat happens if it allowed to transmit to others and mutate further ? \nPeople really have no idea but this disease is being handled exactly as it should , by containing infected individuals by quarantine . \nAccording to a good friend of mine , who is a doctor in the US , 10,000 people died last year in the US from influenza A. swine flu is an influenza A virus so let 's get it in perspective ! \nLet 's avoid the media rather than people . \nHow bad is it ? \nReally ... So far I do n't think so , yes some people have died , very bad that , but on the whole , not that many . \nIs n't the problem that the flu has jumped species ? \nLet 's have something to compare figures to as well , like how many people does ordinary flu kill , of how many people died of malaria last week ? \nI think it 's time for some balance here , not panic and scaremongering . \nMore ridiculous hysteria from the British media . \nDoes n't normal flu kill people who are weakened by other ailments or old age every year ? \nWe had a particularly hot summer a couple of years back and the heat killed several thousand people in France for example . \nDoes this mean we should all be scared of summers ? \nGet a grip BBC editors and stop making stories up over nothing , and that goes for the rest of the media too . \nLet 's maintain some hygiene everywhere as we do not know how it is transmitted . \nPeople in Mexico must n't travel anyhow at the moment because it will be difficult to handle when it comes to Africa where resources are none . \nI am not taking any precautions other than making sure I wash my hands more ! \nI 'm following protocols set by the NHS and not panicking . \nManchester , UK is well prepared for any sort of outbreak . \nIt 's the media that is hyping it all out of proportion ! \nYou should be praising the governments for their work , as oppose to decrying them . \nSo we should be praising the governments for saving us from a crisis that even the Mexicans are saying is non-existent ? \nI know Australia panicked over this one big time , unlike New Zealand which actually had some cases , but what you are saying is ridiculous . \nAh , the man of action ! \nWell Bob , a vaccine wo n't be ready until September at the earliest by which time all those going to die from this virus will have done so . \nOtherwise , a great plan Bob , why did n't anybody else think of it ? \nAndrew , Norwich , UK This story is ridiculous , thousands of people die from normal flu every year and yet we never hear about how that could end humanity or raise the alert to level five or whatever . \nThis story has been blown massively out of proportion . \nAlso the phrase `` deaths have occurred in the US '' needs to be changed to `` death '' , there has only been one . \nI think the media have over-reacted . \nI winced when BBC Breakfast asked their resident doctor her views ... it completely undermined everything the BBC had been saying . \nI 'm surprised the producer did not cut her off . \nIn 1976 Americans were inoculated needlessly . \nWhy not just quarantine ? \nIt 's ironic , because BBC recently ran a series called ` Survivors ' , about people that survived a major pandemic . '' \nI have lost a lot of faith in the BBC . \nvCJD , SARS , bird flu , swine flu ... I wonder what 's going to kill us all next . '' \nWell , in case you have n't noticed , vCJD has killed hundreds in this country including someone I know , and there is a massive risk of it still looming over us , SARS killed hundreds in the East and very nearly became catastrophic , bird flu is still a high risk , and swine flu , even if we do not all get it now , could mutate and we could all get it much worse in winter . \nThis is what the science and facts say . \nI 'm not saying we should panic , just that taking all reasonable precautions and impartially informing people of the risk seems pretty sensible to me . \nKeep the population in a state of panic and they will do anything . \nThe media are doing an excellent job . \nWe can forget about all the real problems and worry about catching a cold . \nWhile precaution is always better than cure , this swine flu is causing an alarm pandemic among world populations . \nMexico has reported only a hundred deaths so far by this epidemic flu , out of thousands of deaths in that country every month by road accidents and drug related murders . \nIn an average day many thousands are killed by ordinary cold flu in the world . \nMany thousands are killed in many parts of the world every day by man-made armed conflict , so the swine flu is not that big a challenge to human society today . \nWhat is there to prevent ? \nIt is out there already . \nOnly the public statistics have not caught up yet . \nI am pretty sure I 've had it and I know where I got it from , but nobody else knows . \nAre n't we all lucky that this is only a mild strain ? \nThe only Pandemic we have at present in the UK is a Media Pandemic . \nHowever this is not to say the populous has forgot how to conduct themselves in public . \nI recently worked in London and took the Tube to work for 4 stops . \nThe hygiene and etiquette of the people was appalling . \nPeople sneezing , coughing and clearing phlegm from their throats on the train . \nNo tissues , nothing . \nNo wonder disease spreads so rapidly today in England no manners or etiquette left . \nI commented to one female whom sneezed with no protection and all I received was a grunt . \nIgnorant and illiterate despite an education . \nRemember the hysteria built-up around that ? \nHere we go again . \nCompletely over the top reporting and headline grabbing as usual . \nAnyone who 's had it here appears to be showing ` remarkable ' signs of recovery considering the `` deadly '' nature of this flu . \nWe saw a crying mother and child outside a school on the news , worried about the terror about to spread the nation . \nThe Red-Top rags whipped-up their vision of doom . \nSeen any canceled big crowd events ? \nNo , of course not . \nStill expect any mother who has a child come home to them with so much as a sniffle and it 'll be straight to the Max Clifford 's ... sorry that should read ` Doctor ' . \nThe world & media are reacting the way they should ! \nMeasured concern is desirable . \nPrecaution by WHO , governments and individuals is a must . \nWe know that it 's a blow on the countries ' economy and on their citizens but the spread must be contained before it 's too late . \nLet 's bear it patiently and intelligently . \nThe next time you catch a train consider that statistically about 1 in 60 people on that train will die this year . \nThat might be 5 people on your train and it could even be you . \nSo stop using the trains because some people will die ? \nThis pig flu scare is ridiculous when the chance of getting it is almost nil and the chances of dying from it are even lower . \n`` Stop talking about it and give every one a vaccine '' Bob , Cambridge As yet there is no vaccine for Swine Flu . \nIt takes about six months to produce one from the Blood-serum of an infected person Meanwhile , until the Vaccine is available , those testing positive for the A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- Virus can be given the anti-viral Tamiflu which is a treatment not an A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- - specific Vaccine . \nWhen are we going to get responsible media that report facts and not hysteria ? \nIf this swine flu is not new , I believe it has been in nature from the beginning of our world , then we have to admit we are losing our body immunising capability to adapt to nature . \nMedicine , drugs and our living habits have changed our body from nature . \nThe more we live far from nature , the more we will sicken . \nHow to avoid a swine flu pandemic ? \nStop the sensationalist reporting by irresponsible news media . \nJeff Piper , Stanley , United Kingdom Everyone who is saying `` it was all a media generated panic '' needs to take a course in public health . \nThe reason we have preventative measures -LRB- such as those that were taken -RRB- was so that we could prevent thousands of people from dying . \nWhat is the point in starting preventative measures when thousands already have the disease ? \nWould you prefer it were like Hurricane Katrina ? \n`` Oh it 's just a big storm , there is no need to take any preventative measures before it gets here '' . \nThe whole point of preventative measures is so that we can prevent a catastrophe from happening . \nYou should be praising the governments for their work , as oppose to decrying them . \nGood work people , good work . \nIf this virus is truly not so virulent at the moment , would it not be better just to catch it and get some immunity in case it emerges , deadlier , in the winter ? \nWhatever - the media itself may be being fed disinformation . \nBut how ironic if by paying more attention to hygiene , the result was a cut in all infections . \nBooo hoo , a man in Ireland sneezed 15 mins ago , Breaking news ! \nPlease , this is a non story , stop trying making it into something it is n't and wo n't be and start reporting on something important . \nEven with the slightest chance of getting this complaint , we really are very relaxed in our attitudes to disease . \nStop talking about it and give every one a vaccine . \nHow many cases of this flu have we in the UK ? \nWe get 15 people an hour go down with the flu in my company in winter . \nThe people who had ` died ' from this flu , have actually died from secondary complications ; in part due to the appalling health conditions in Mexico . \nThe over blown reporting of this is ridiculous . \nSome chap gets the sniffles and he is filmed on his mobile commenting about his flu like symptoms . \nWow , sensational stuff . \nYou know , he might be suffering from a bit of hay fever . \nThe WHO have cried wolf . \nThe next time they issue another pandemic alert , nobody will believe them . \nI reckon it 's a conspiracy to take our minds of the recession . \nOne should be careful about cleanliness of their surroundings and should eat hygienic food , particularly meats . \nAlso the government should take certain actions regarding this . \nTo what extent is this allegedly possible pandemic connected to the stocks of flu vaccine and the expiry date of that vaccine ? \nI wonder how many children have died from malaria\\/diarrhea , in the world since the outbreak and hysteria about swine flu . \nWhat I do n't get is that at the moment we 're at level five , the same level for Spanish flu -LRB- 1918-1920 -RRB- . \nSo far swine flu has killed say a couple of hundred if you count all the suspected deaths Spanish flu killed millions of people . \nThere is no evidence of the swine flu virus spreading in a sustained way outside North America , a top World Health Organization official says . \nLooks like no pandemic to avoid . \nAnother media generated storm in a tea cup -LRB- or is it sneeze in a hanky ! -RRB- \nSwine flu has come along at just the right time for us all to forget about MPs ' expenses and the failing economy ... How convenient ! \nVery concerned , it seems to me the less animals we eat or mess around with is better for us all I do n't have any concerns simply because it has been an over reaction to something that is at the end of the day a very bad cold . \nThe real swines wear 3 piece suits and work for the banks . \nWe 'll be lucky to get rid of them before they get rid of us . \nSwine flu has turned out to be no worse than `` normal flu '' . \nSo , will the media , including the BBC , now apologise for the mass panic they caused . \nI have lost a lot of faith in the BBC . \nvCJD , SARS , Bird Flu , Swine Flu ... I wonder what 's going to kill us all next . \nWith every passing day it becomes clearer that the media and many people here on HYS were in panic mode . \nMexico way over-reacted ; many of the deaths attributed to swine flu were from nothing of the sort ; and this is a very mild virus overall . \nPeter Nelson , boston MA USA I think WTO 's officials and health department of every country must take serious action to control such a dangerous swine flu . \nIf we do not take serious action now it ca n't be controlled . \nMany of the countries do not have enough facilities to control this flu . \nIf we go to the rural areas people are not aware about this world flu . \nI request all the countries to take the action now and show the world 's power ... The pandemic that 's really worrying is the hysteria pandemic of governments . \nAlthough it is a bit too early to say , this appears to have been handled very well by our government and others . \nThe spread of a virus has been tracked and scientists will have gained insight as to how such viruses spread . \nAlthough the virus does not appear to be as severe as first thought , this may be a trial run for when a more serious virus does evolve . \nPerhaps we are on the way to eliminating flu . \nHow can a responsible media like BBC report on overreaction as if it were negative . \nA vigorous response is the only response to imminent threats . \nIn retrospect we all know the answer to how serious the threat really was , but we always need to assume the worst initially . \nThe Mexican Government did the right thing and deserve praise for not delaying . \nAmerica is indispensible in solving this problem , regardless of what the haters write and say . \nMy concern is that everytime the WHO and the media hype a story about an epidemtic or pandemic which turns out not to be the case , that they 're creating a `` cry wolf '' senario . \nWhen there REALLY is a serious problem , no one will believe it . \nAvian flu , SARS , swine flu ... stop with the overdramatization of illnesses . \nLife today is one crisis or disaster after another . \nPeople in all nations panic at every turn . \nI guess Chicken Little was right . \n`` The sky is falling , the sky is falling '' . \nWe are becoming a sad and sorry lot . \nYour new headlines is . . \n`` Did Mexico Over-React ? '' \nermm answer `` NOPE '' . \nLike everything else these days the MEDIA over reacted ... we are heading for a `` cry wolf '' situation ... end of . \nIn Canada we do not take any type of precautions , other than washing our hands after we go to the toilet or whenever we touch another person Wayne Webster , WPG , MB CANADA Typical BBC scaremongering , put about by those who have no scientific background ; only hype and stupidity . \nMy advice is , if you feel the symptoms of ` flu coming on , which in itself is a rare thing , I get the hottest curry available : either a Vindaloo or Bangalore Phal or even a hot Texas Chilli , if I ca n't get a curry , and wash it down with a load of ice cold beers and whisky chasers . \nFeel great , then if you are a BBC wimp ? \nI have suspected all along this panic over flu was premature or might even be false alarm . \nThe only case in Hong Kong is a Mexican man who just happened to get sick here . \nSo far , not one other person has come down with the swine flu . \nI live in Mexico City and can say that the media has exaggerated this plus it has been quite inaccurate including the BBC -LRB- sorry -RRB- . \nYes , the streets are empty in the center - of course , everything is closed ! \nI 'm sick of that BBC reporter what 's - his-name that was here telling us that there is less traffic thus less pollution and so the skies are blue again for the first time . \nThe sky is always magnificently blue in Mexico City and I have 100 's of photos to prove it . \nHe must only have been here before in the winter when it 's overcast . \nJust these little untruths become really annoying for the people that live here . \nYes , people are worried but not terrified and there 's certainly no panic . \nIt 's 9:30 PM here , I just went to the chemist and everything is normal apart from some people wearing masks , including myself . \nWe need to follow the news much less these days for some peace of mind . \nI know my mother back home almost had a stroke from the worry . \nThis whole thing has been a media fed frenzy of paranoia and panic . \nThe situation has grown completely out of hand on the back of very little supporting evidence and now -LRB- it turns out -RRB- those ` in charge ' have admitted they may have over-reacted . \nThe problem is that the media love throwing the term Pandemic around in an End Of Days fashion and people hear the word without truly knowing what it means and assume the very worst . \nI can only hope that perhaps the media -LRB- and the BBC as as guilty as everyone else of this -RRB- learn something from this whole situation . \nIt 's even dafter than the Bird Flu & SARS scares of a couple of years ago . \nCancer , AIDS , Malaria -LRB- and many others -RRB- are the ones we need to worry about and focus on . \nWhere 's your media frenzy for them ? \nI have suspected all along this panic over flu was premature or might even be false alarm . \nThe only case in Hong Kong is a Mexican man who just happened to get sick here . \nSo far , not one other person has come down with the swine flu . \nI 've said right from the beginning that there was no evidence to support the official panic over this . \nPoliticians used to have more courage and , dare I say it , much better judgement . \nSome people have died of a new flu variant , and always will - that 's the nature of viruses . \nThere is nothing new here to merit action outside countries adjacent to Mexico . \nThe official count of 160 cases of swine flu in the US is a gross underestimation in my opinion . \nIn Culver City my uncle started to show flu symptoms . \nAfter contacting multiple doctors , pharmacies , emergency rooms , and even the CDC , he was given absolutely no help . \nHe was told that the anti viral drugs are not available , and that he needed to stay at home . \nHow many more people are showing flu symptoms , and not being tested ? \nWhy are we being lied to about the amount of help available ? \nChris , Huntington Beach , California , USA According to World Health Organisation the spread of the disease is not as bad as first thought , so pandemic headlines are all wrong . \nStill usual scare mongering from BBC and government Tom Smith , Newcastle upon Tyne I think the WHO and governments have been stupid about how bad they thought this outbreak was going to be . \nWe had the same with SARS and bird flu and both came to nothing , so why should everyone panic and why should the media make everyone panic . \nOnly if the outbreak got really bad should the media let us know how bad it is and what are the consequences of it . \nBut as it looks like that is not going to happen they should let people forget about it and get back to normal lives . \nEngland , Scotland and Wales can not avoid a possible pandemic . \nReason , well we live in vastly populated regions , take England as the example , here people only live on about 30 per cent of the country , the rest is uninhabited . \nThe WHO comments of about 40 per cent of people being infected in a pandemic , is short of the mark in my opinion . \nThe situation could turn nasty if it not properly contained . \nBack in 1918 the Influenza pandemic began around the same time as we see the swine flu pandemic starting now -LRB- March to April -RRB- . \nIt did n't pose as a serious threat as cases were as minimal as we see today . \nIt was only until around October in the same year that cases and fatalities rose sharply -LRB- due to the recirculation of contaminated air more common in the winter period when people are indoors for longer -RRB- . \nAnd over the winter period the world saw one of the worst pandemics in recorded history . \nThe only problem is , that I think that we are falling into the same trap of this false sense of security that it dose n't look to bad at the moment . \nHopefully the governments of the world will realize this sooner rather than later . \nI think that all of this media hype is quite necessary , and we should not just shunt the threat to the back of our minds and continue worrying about the current economic climate . \nPhilip Leonard , Southport Great Britain Seems to me that every 10 years or so a really new strain of the flu virus comes to the front and all panic . \nWe have survived Asian and Bird flu amongst others so what is the panic about ? \nThe only people at risk are those with poor immune systems and those in warm countries where normal winter flu provides immunity . \nAll flu kills so what is new , or are the government about to remove more of our civil liberties and need a diversion . \nSuddenly the world economic crisis does n't matter , the US torture memos disappeared , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are distant memories ... suddenly all we hear about is the swine flu . \nI 'm not concerned about swine flu . \nI even wonder if it really exists . \nThe WHO know what is going on better than all of us and they have a much better understanding of Swine Flu than we do . \nExperts say that the virus is extremely contagious , the only reason why this is hard to believe is because those people with it in the UK are being treated and are being kept away from other people . \nIf the medical care was not there I am sure that we would have suffered the same effect that Mexico has . \nTherefore , should n't we just trust the professionals ? \nWithout this awareness , people would not be taking precautions and would still be flying to many places , including Mexico then many more people would have it ! \nWe should be grateful for all the information that we have been given . \nIt is obviously extremely serious , the WHO are not going to exaggerate how serious this actually is . \nAnd as for `` living our lives in constant fear '' -LRB- Daniel , Folkestone -RRB- , I would much rather be scared , take precautions and not get swine flu than live complaining about the media etc and get it . \nPlease please stop broadcasting so much hype about a flu that is affecting so few people , more people die of ordinary flu . \nI am sick of hearing about it Typical of BBC to kill a story by continually talking about it . \nIt 's flu , now change the record , people die each year from flu here and abroad . \nI am already very aware of how unhygienic many many people are . \nI have to be aware as my partner had a kidney transplant and her immune system is very low due to anti rejection medication . \nIf we go out for a meal , she is normally ill for a couple of days , going out for a drink is a rare occasion and quite risky . \nI do the shopping , so she can avoid contact and contamination in public places where there are a lot of people . \nGoing on public transport is not even entertained . \nMost public toilets in bars , restaurants , shops and even hospitals are badly designed and are where most people get contaminated with other peoples faeces and urine , as well as other bacterial\\/germ infested fluids . \nDoors of all public toilets should open outwards or have Z corridors without doors . \nIt is madness to wash your hands & then get contaminated by others who do not wash their hands , when you open the door to get out . \nI should think that public toilets are a main area of cross infection for many illnesses & sicknesses\\/upset stomachs etc. . \nThe way I 'm thinking about this `` Pandemic '' is by NOT thinking about it . \nThere is nothing that WE , the public , can actually do about it apart from taking hygienic precautions . \nThere is no need to worry because if we get it , we get it . \nWe ca n't just get rid of it and it 's just another annual scare we have . \nBird flu , Spanish flu , they 're all the same . \nThe media , mainly newspapers are blowing the whole `` swine flu '' out of proportion just to preoccupy ourselves from other crisis ' around the world , eg : war and economy . \nHow can we avoid a pandemic ? \nWell , we obviously need governments with enough spine and guts to shut down travel and borders to prevent disease from spreading . \nWe are lucky it is n't a more deadly virus because we allowed it on every plane , boat , car and rail out of Mexico and it has now traveled the globe because of our inability to say , `` People before profit '' . \nAll we hear is how it would damage the economy . \nI do n't want the people in charge of these matters to consider my health at the same table they consider economics , because the people will lose to profit every time . \nIt 's a wake up call . \nI 'm not worried and I think it is all being over-hyped by the media and government to take our minds off other things . \nAnyone would think this is the Ebola virus . \nThe way I look at it is you die eventually anyway , so if it 's my time , then it 's my time . \nNo sense in worrying over it . \nWe ca n't avoid it but we can control how we manage it . \nPeople are more able to cope with flu during the summer and less resistant during the winter . \nWe could therefore elect to have the flu this summer and minimize the effects . \nOnce caught , the body is immune . \nGoodbye worrying about it too . \nWe could have a national flu week or if that stretched our health resources too much we could elect to have flu weeks by age group . \nYou ca n't prevent a pandemic in this age of cheap flights , once the disease has started it can be transported all round the world before the governments even know there is a problem . \nJim Maguire , Newcastle Upon Tyne , UK Above everything do not take any notice of the media . \nA revised death toll in Mexico gives a total of 101 deaths . \nWhile the whole planet panics over this flu , how many thousands have died in road accidents ? \nPeople catch flu all the time and sadly , some of them die . \nSending a leaflet on how to wash your hands , to every household in this country , just means another rainforest gone ! \nKnowing that we had the first confirmed case of Swine flu in the UK on Monday , the Government should have said that all 10,000 Brits on holiday in Mexico , who are now flying back early from their holidays , should be made to wear masks through the airport as a precaution , and so as not to spread the virus to all and sundry . \nInstead the media are stopping them for a chat to get their views ! \n90,000 people have died of malaria since the outbreak of the swine flu . \nThere is no over-the-counter medication to treat malaria . \nSo , no , I am not at all worried about the swine flu . \nTricia Casper , Pasadena , CA , USA I think that the only way we can avoid it is by : Wearing masks and Obeying all the doctors and Health Departments are saying . \nBy panicking we are going nowhere . \nPeople please calm down !! We live in what is now the biotechnological age , having advanced beyond the dangers of the nuclear age , into new perils . \nThat means that every new , infectious , illness causing , organism , must be responded to as if it is a deadly threat to human survival as soon as it is detected . \nWe can never be certain whether nature or human actions were the root cause of a new infectious organism , and even though that might be determined later , that question is never a valid basis for deciding what to do in response to infection . \nIt 's so over rated . \nMillions die of normal flu every year and we have like 500 cases and everyone is worried . \nI am shocked at some of the comments on here . \nHow can people possibly say that this is just the media causing a panic amongst the ` naive ' , when it is documented fact that flu can kill millions , and likely will again . \nIs it not wise to keep the public informed ? \nI 'm not panicking but I am certainly concerned -LRB- I agree that this government especially would have trouble containing it 's spread -RRB- . \nIf this flu fades away into obscurity like bird flu appears to have , for the time being , we should consider ourselves lucky . \nHowever , I suspect it 'll just be a great opportunity for the smug to say ' I told you so ' to the media and WHO . \nOh , and I am a doctor of microbiology , so ` naivety ' does not come into it , I 'm afraid . \nSurely the sensible thing to do is to not try to contain the current strain of H1N1 as the symptoms are mild and usually not fatal . \nBy allowing the virus to spread around the world , people who contract the virus would have immunity against a much more potent strain which is likely to be going around in the autumn , before a vaccine has been created and effectively distributed ? \nBy trying to contain the current strain , governments are storing up a nightmare scenario for later in the year . \nIn all seriousness the `` big one '' will happen when something like Ebola Zaire jumps on a plane and comes visiting . \nEven the non weaponised version has a kill rate of approx 80-90 % with no cure and no treatment . \nWe had a scare with this a few years in the UK when a plane landed and they thought someone had the disease -LRB- luckily it was a false alarm -RRB- . \nThey isolated him but let the other passengers back out into the main population ! \nDo you mean a swine flu pandemic or a media swine flu pandemic ? \nThe former is n't a problem anyway , the way to solve the latter is to stop reporting on it . \nI called the NHS direct as my son had been in contact with his boss who had come back from Mexico Sunday last . \nThey were very quick to re-act . \nThey were pretty sure that he did not have the swine flu . \nThey said that he would have to be seen by a doctor . \nThis was at 10.15 am . \nI was called by seldoc four times asking the same questions , and at 3.10 pm they called and said he did not need any further attention and they would not send a doctor out . \nIf we are going to contain this we need more commitment from GPS . \nWe are still not sure if he has the virus or not . \nThis episode has been very interesting in that the media seems to have been completely taken in by the hysteria while the public have not believed a word and have maintained a much more calm and balanced view of the situation . \nNobody trusts the media any more , and judging from they way it has reported this flu virus , we 're right not to . \nI do n't hear much about what the preventive therapeutic measures are for people who are not yet affected . \nShould they take vitamin c or an inhalation of some type ? \nWhat type of food to be avoided etc ? \nI think areas affected should be sprayed by a helicopter with some kind of germicide . \nEven homes should be smoked with some kind of germicide . \nAshok , St Petersburg , FL , USA And so it begins . \nThe media starts it 's inevitable climb down by stating that ` officials ' are ` cautiously optimistic ' that things may not be as bad as first thought . \nWhen I was a kid my mother worried about illness : smallpox , diphtheria , scarlet fever , polio - all killers . \nI caught Asian flu in the '57 pandemic and spent a week in bed . \nNot pleasant but not life threatening if you took care . \nAnti-virals did not exist . \nThe advice was to keep warm and not go out until the symptoms had gone . \nNo schools or businesses shut down and there were no quarantines . \nThe present outbreak seems much less severe so far . \nThis is flu , which many catch every year . \nIt is not plague , or ebola or typhus . \nWe should not lose our sense of proportion . \nDavid Rushworth , Hemel Hempstead , UK From what I understand , an infected person is\\/maybe contagious from day one before they display any symptoms . \nIf this is so , why not take blood samples or whatever from all passengers before they board the airplane . \nBy the time they reach their destination -LRB- hopefully , we can know if there are any cases on board before they reach their destination -RRB- necessary action may then be taken . \nIt may be a bit of a hassle but its better than sitting on our hands . \nAlso I dunno why closing borders does n't make sense - if the reason is economics , then I say it 's either `` a stitch in time saves nine '' ... or `` Penny wise pound foolish '' . \nHow many farmers and their families were ruined last time the country over-reacted to a media ` pandemic ' ? \nI remember watching a documentary on TV not so long ago , it was about some scientists who decided to exhume the corps of a man who died of the Spanish flu virus pandemic in 1918 . \nI hear now that the SWINE flu virus -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- is the same virus !!! They have the original Spanish flue virus in their hands , in some super safe , high tech lab , -LRB- we all hope so anyway -RRB- , I am asking a simple question ; Did this virus escape when they opened the lead lined coffin ? \nAvoid the swine flu by following health safety standards for other diseases . \nAvoid crowds , air travel , infectious persons and wash hands frequently . \nFor now practice quarantine and then stop herding huge numbers of pigs into a small confined space full of their own excrement . \nAnd do n't allow fowl and humans to live in close proximity to them . \nBetter yet stop eating pork so there is no reason to keep these garbage eaters confined in the first place . \nAs long as we do n't know how it is being transmitted to one another we should take precautions like staying away from infected people . \nIt 's not easy to not to talk and approach people as this is a big part of life , for example shopping , schooling . \n"}

{"id": "352", "time": "2009-04-30", "text": "Eight cases of swine flu have emerged in the UK Two more people in London have been diagnosed with the swine flu virus , the Department of Health -LRB- DH -RRB- confirmed . \nThe 23-year-old man from Islington , north London , and 29-year-old man from Westminster , central London , have mild symptoms , the DH said . \nThey are being treated at their homes and are among eight people in the UK known to have caught the H1N1 virus . \nDoctors said a 22-year-old man from Barnet , north London , was responding well to treatment for the virus . \nThe Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said it was investigating 230 possible cases , all of which were associated with travel to Mexico . \nIt added that people exposed to a `` probable or confirmed '' case of swine flu in the past seven days , for more than one hour and within a distance of 1m -LRB- 3.2 ft -RRB- have been offered anti-viral drugs `` as a precautionary measure '' . \nA DH spokesman said : `` The preparations we have in place and are continuing to make will help to ensure we respond well in the event of a pandemic . '' \nTransport warning over swine flu Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A , which infects pigs . \nUntil now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form of the virus can . \nThe man from Barnet caught the virus during a recent visit to Mexico and was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead on Wednesday . \nA spokesman for the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust said he was `` brought to the trust in a secure , specialist ambulance '' . \n`` Staff are scrupulously following infection control procedures to ensure no other patient or member of staff is at risk , '' he added . \nLondon authorities said they were working closely with other agencies to monitor and deal with any issues from the outbreak . \nLondon Councils ' Chairman Councillor Merrick Cockell said : `` London 's local authorities have been preparing for the possible outbreak of a flu pandemic for the last five years so are primed to respond to any issues arising as a result of swine flu in the capital .

{"id": "782", "time": "2009-06-29", "text": "Swine flu ` shows drug resistance ' The drug has been offered to those with close contact to swine flu Experts have reported the first case of swine flu that is resistant to tamiflu - the main drug being used to fight the pandemic . \nRoche Holding AG confirmed a patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed resistance to the antiviral drug . \nDavid Reddy , company executive , said it was not unexpected given that common seasonal flu could do the same . \nThe news comes as a nine-year-old girl has become the third to die in the UK with swine flu . \nIt is understood from her doctors at Birmingham Children 's Hospital that she had underlying health conditions . \nIt is not yet known whether swine flu contributed to her death . \nMeanwhile , the Department of Health has announced a big jump in the number of patients in England confirmed with swine flu - up 1,604 since Friday , taking the UK total so far to 5,937 . \nRoutine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman Experts have been using tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , in a bid to stop the H1N1 spreading in communities . \nIf taken early , it ensures that symptoms are mild and reduces the chance of a victim giving the illness to someone else . \nThis first reported case of resistance developed in a swine flu patient taking Tamiflu . \nMr Reddy stressed that there were no signs of a tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 circulating in the community . \nThis is in contrast to seasonal H1N1 flu where a Tamiflu resistant strain emerged last year and is now widely circulating . \nExperts fear if this were to happen , it could render tamiflu ineffective . \nAnother antiviral drug , called zanamivir or Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , is also effective against swine flu . \nThe UK government has been stockpiling these antiviral drugs and currently has enough to treat half of the population , with a contract to bring that up to 80 % as soon as possible . \nSupplies of flu vaccine have also been ordered and the first doses could be administered in the autumn . \nA spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said : `` The Health Protection Agency continues to watch for antiviral resistance and will be carrying out regular sample testing throughout this outbreak . \n`` We have been monitoring antiviral drug resistance since the beginning of this outbreak . \nRoutine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir .

{"id": "937", "time": "2009-05-31", "text": "On yesterday 's Talk Back , a Presbyterian Mutual Society saver explained why he , and others , would be holding a protest at the opening session of this year 's Presbyterian General Assembly . \nMervyn Redmond , a spokesman for the Shore Street PMS Action Group in Donaghadee , said , ` We feel betrayed ' by the Presbyterian Church . \n` We and our families and forebears have always turned to the Church in times of serious difficulty , but during this desperate situation we are reduced to confronting the Church leaders and elders because they have refused to take a compassionate and fruitful initiative , ' he said in a press statement . \nI 've asked many Presbyterian ministers , elders and memebrs just how serious a challenge to the church is posed by collapse of the Presbyterian Mutual Society . \nIn short , no one can remember a comparable public controversy involving the church . \nSome say this has been the greatest challenge to the leadership of the Presbyterian Church in the denomination 's history . \nSerious questions are being asked by PMS members about the way this crisis has been handled by Church House officials , and some of those questions may be raised during the debate on Tuesday . \nWas enough done to respond practically to those PMS members who have been placed in financial difficulties as a consequence of the mutual 's collapse ? \nJust how close is the association between the church and the mutual society ? \nThey share a website and email address , and they once shared a building . \nSome PMS members say the communications and PR material they receieved from the Mutual Society and the church gave the impression that the mutual was an agency of the church . \nEven though they accept the church official statement that the two organizations are `` legally separate '' , those investors are asking who is responsible for giving that impression of a closer association ? \nWhen I asked Mervyn Redmond what he wanted to see now from his church , I was struck by his answer . \nHe said he wanted the church to look like they cared , that they were listening , that they were interested in the plight of PMS members who thought they were helping their church when they placed money with the mutual society . \nOn Tuesday afternoon , at the General Assembly , Mervyn Redmond and others will be listening carefully for clear answers to those questions , and for signs of a compassionate and caring response . \nUpdate : The leaders of the Catholic , Methodist and Anglican churches in Ireland have released a joint statement : `` We have become increasingly aware of the difficulties faced by people whose access to their savings has been blocked by the Presbyterian Mutual Society being placed in Administration . \nSince assistance has been offered to others , it is our hope that the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government will take urgent action to resolve these difficulties . '' \nThe statement is signed by Cardinal Se n Brady , Catholic Archbishop of Armagh , Archbishop Alan Harper , Anglican Archbishop of Armagh , and Rev. Aian Ferguson , President of the Methodist Church Patsty McGarry of the Irish Times has been writing about last week 's edition of Sunday Sequence , and how our program may have influenced the public debate about how the church should repond to child abuse . \nMoney quotes : ` Then , at the weekend , Cori felt unable to supply BBC Northern Ireland 's Sunday Sequence program with a representative for a discussion on the Ryan commission report . \nIt seemed there would be no one to represent the church on the program . \nFurther inquiries led to Cardinal Brady 's general assistant Fr Tim Bartlett going forth , like Noah 's dove , to test the waters , while speaking in a personal capacity . \nWe now know he did so with the permission of Cardinal Brady , who was also aware of Fr Bartlett 's strong personal views on the subject . \nOn the program , with some prompting by Sunday Sequence presenter William Crawley , Fr Bartlett eventually crossed the ecclesiastical Rubicon and called on the congregations to revisit the deal . ' \n` The umpire had struck . \nWithin a very short time Fr Bartlett 's own bishop , Most Rev Noel Traenor , Bishop of Down and Connor , rushed in where angels might not tread . \nHe praised Fr Bartlett for his views and his courage , ringfencing his priest from the likely consequences of such courage where the congregations were concerned . \nThen Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan discovered his voice and called on the congregations to contribute more to the State redress scheme for former residents of institutions . \nA momentum was building . ' \nThe research findings are not without controversy , but it 's claimed that this fossil , nicknamed ` Ida ' , is a significant transitional form -- in fact , the missing link and , thus , our earliest ancestor . \nRead the key research paper making that claim here . \nA reproduction of Ida arrived in London 's Natural History Museum today , ahead of David Attenborough 's television documentary about the fossil find , which has just been screened . \nIda was named after the young daughter of one of the leaders of the research team that investigated the find . \nIt 's been given the scientific name Darwinius masillae , a designation honoring Charles Darwin . \nAs you might expect , creationists are less than impressed by the fossil . \nAccording to Answers in Genesis , ` Nothing about this fossil suggests it is anything other than an extinct , lemur-like creature . ' \nThey also wonder why ` Evolutionists only open up about the lack of fossil missing links once a new one is found . ' \nOne thing is sure : we 'll all be getting to know Ida pretty well over the next few weeks . \nAn aside : I 've been watching Richard Dawkins in conversation with Paul Davies at the 2009 Origins Symposium , and Dawkins suggests that Charles Darwin never actually completed his degree at university . \nPaul Davies appears to agree with that claim . \nAt the risk of challenging Dawkins on Darwin , I 've always understood that Darwin finished a degree in theology at Cambridge -LRB- Christ 's College , ironically enough -RRB- , having abandoned his earlier studies in medicine at Edinburgh . \nHence , the use of the 'M . \nA. ' postnominal on the title page of The Origin of Species . \nPerhaps Dawkins is referring to the abandoned medical degree . \nIn any case , it 's an interesting conversation . \nThe basic beliefs and practises of Scientology are listed here . \nWhen Tom Cruise mentions `` KSW '' , this is what he has in mind . \nThe Church of Scotland 's supreme court has agreed to end public debate about homosexuality for a period of two years , while a special commission investigates the theological and legal issues surrounding the appointment of gay ministers within the church . \nThe General Assembly has instructed all authoritative bodies within Scotland 's national church to avoid any public comment on the matter -- including press releases , briefings to the media , and blogging -- and to avoid taking any decisions in relation to ` contentious matters of human sexuality , with respect to Ordination and Induction to the Ministry of the Church of Scotland , until 31 May 2011 ' . \nThe Assembly also made it clear that the moratorium is not retrospective , and emphasized that its earlier decision to uphold the installation of a gay minister in Aberdeen stands . \nSome conservatives on the floor of the house pointed out that the Assembly 's decision , on Saturday evening , to sustain a call from a parish in Aberdeen to a gay minister , the Reverend Scott Rennie , left open two possible legal challenges before any installation could take place . \nFirst , the minister 's current Presbytery would have to take a decision to permit the Rev Scott Rennie to leave his parish , and , second , a service of Installation or Induction might also be construed as an action of a court inconsistent with the moratorium . \nThe Moderator , Dr Bill Hewitt , emphasized , with the support of the Assembly 's Acting Principal Clerk , that the spirit of the decision on Saturday evening was clear : the Reverend Scott Rennie was permitted to accept the call to a parish in Aberdeen and , there being no other legal impediments to his installation , that he could be installed . \nThe Acting Principal Clerk , Dr Marjorie MacLean , advised Mr Rennie not to rob any banks before his installation , since this could constitute a legal impediment ; but his sexuality , and the fact that he lives openly with his partner , is not . \nWe wait to see whether today 's decision will have any ramifications for the Irish Presbyterian Church , whose General Assembly meets in the first week of June . \nWill any Presbyterian ministers seek to introduce a resolution responding to the historic events of this week in their mother church ? \nI suspect not ; but time will tell . \nNot according to the archbishops of Canterbury and York . \nRowan Williams and John Sentamu have picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the BNP , whose recent ad campaign featured Jesus and the question , ` What would Jesus do ? ' \nThe archbishops have penned a joint letter which essentially calls on Christians to vote for parties other than the BNP . \nMoney quote : ` Christians have been deeply disturbed by the conscious adoption by the BNP of the language of our faith when the effect of those policies is not to promote those values but to foster fear and division within communities , especially between people of different faiths or racial background . ' \nThat 's how the Presbyterian Moderator , Dr Donald Patton -LRB- pictured -RRB- , responded to last night 's decision by Scotland 's national church to approve the appointment of an openly gay minister who lives with his partner . \nWhen I asked him if he could envisage a future in which the Presbyterian Church in Ireland would make a similarly inclusive decision about gay ministers , Dr Patton replied , ' I think our Assembly simply would n't tolerate a situation like that . ' \nWatch an interview with the gay minister at the center of this controversy , the Rev Scott Rennie , here . \nMr Rennie explains that the 18-month ordeal of the appointment and appeal has taken its toll on him : ` I 've been personally hurt and , as you can image , it 's made life pretty stressful . ' \nHere 's what happened . \nIt seems that Tony Curtis , who took our call while doing a book signing at Harrods in London , had forgotten that we would be broadcasting live , otherwise he would n't have used the language he did on the show . \nWhen he realized it was live , he was very upset about the language he 'd drifted into -- an F-word and two B-words -- and apologised profusely . \nIn fact , he was concerned that the people of Northern Ireland might be angry with him when he visits here next week to talk about his recently published memoirs . \nI assured him that Northern Irish people are very understanding , that his reputation as a Holywood legend remained intact , and ended this edition of Talk Back by suggesting that this program would go down in history as one of the more ` unpredictable ' moments in broadcasting . \nNow , members of the public are coming up to me in the street to ask that we pass on their best wishes and admiration to Tony Curtis . \nI suspect many more will turn out to warmly greet Mr Curtis when he visits Northern Ireland on Wednesday . \nWhen I got back to my desk after yesterday 's program , one of the letters waiting for me was from a listener who was concerned because she had heard me use the word `` gosh '' on a previous edition of Talk Back . \nAlso enclosed in the envelope was a booklet explaining that `` gosh '' was a euphemism for `` God '' ; my use of the term , according to the letter , amounted to ` taking God 's name in vain . ' \nIt 's a funny old world . \nThat 's how one victim of clerical abuse described his experience of physical and sexual violence at the hands of Catholic religious brothers in Ireland . \nMr Justice Ryan 's five-volume report contains an horrific litany of abuse carried out against vulnerable children in 250 schools over a period of six decades . \nThe report describes ritualised beatings , torture , sexual humiliation , and rape perpetrated by priests , brothers and nuns in church-run institutions . \nMr Justice Ryan says rape was `` endemic '' , and church authorities covered-up abuses . \nThe Ryan Commission 's report is a catalogue of horrific violation ; it is an account of one of the darkest episodes in the history of the Irish state . \nWe committed almost all of today 's Talk Back to covering the Ryan revelations . \nSome of out callers told their personal stories , some simply expressed their shock , their deep confusion about how supposedly spiritual people could commit such appalling crimes against children . \nMore than one compared the torture revelations to what we 've heard about the mistreatment of prisoners in Guantanemo Bay . \nChildren were scolded , burned , waterboarded , flogged , sexually abused and violently raped by men and women who said they had religious vocations . \nOur program , which is available on the BBC iPlayer , began with Mike Philpott 's deeply personal reflection on this story . \nThe Ryan Commission accounts triggered memories for Mike he would sooner forget . \nMike has permitted me to reprint his reflection below the line . \nHe 's beginning to look like the Malcolm Tucker of the Catholic Church . \nPeter Jennings -LRB- pictured -RRB- , press secretary to the new archbishop of Westminster , has gained a certain reputation amongst Britain 's religious press corp. . \nHe 's been my guest a few times on Sunday Sequence and he 's always been charming and very articulate . \nBut that 's not been everyone 's experience , it would appear . \nLast month , he verbally mauled the Daily Telegraph 's religion correspondent . \nThis month , it 's alleged that he 's been hurling the same four-word scatalogism at an Oxford University student . \nMatthew Tye , a 22-year-old postgraduate student , has written a letter of complaint to Archbishop Vincent Nichols and claims that Mr Jennings repeatedly called him a s \\*\\*\\* at an event held in Blackfriars , Oxford , which was attended by Francis Campbell , the UK 's Ambassador to the Vatican . \nPeter Jennings has told the papers that he ` deeply regretted the incident and any embarrassment caused ' , although he regards the matter as ' a typhoon in a tea spoon ' . \nSome well-known church leaders from Northern Ireland have added their names to a petition encouraging the General Assembly of Scotland 's national church to prohibit a gay minister from taking up a new pastoral position in Aberdeen . \nThe petition , organised by the Fellowship of Confessing Churches , a conservative campaign group within the Church of Scotland , also calls on the General Assembly to support a controversial Overture -LRB- or resolution -RRB- that `` this Church shall not accept for training , ordain , admit , re-admit , induct or introduce to any ministry of the Church anyone involved in a sexual relationship outside of faithful marriage between a man and a woman '' . \nTo date , more than 11,000 people have signed the online petition . \nOf those , more than 2,000 are members of other churches throughout the UK , including Irish denominations . \nThe list includes a number of former Presbyterian moderators -LRB- Dr Alistair Dunlop , Dr John Lockington , and Dr Ivan McKay , and others -RRB- , a former president of the Irish Methodist Church -LRB- Rev Jim Rea -RRB- , and executive level administrators within the Irish Presbyterian Church -LRB- Rev Trevor Gribben , Deputy Clerk of the General Assembly ; Rev David Bruce , executive secretary of the Board of Mission in Ireland ; and Rev Ronnie Hetherington , Director of Ministerial Studies -RRB- . \nOther signatories include the Rev Martin Smyth , former South Belfast unionist MP , and the Rev Bobby Liddle , who authored the Presbyterian Church 's 2007 report on homopbobia , alongside ministers from various denominations , elders , theological lecturers , students and church members . \nThe history of the church is littered with theological battlefields . \nIn the distant past , churches debated , and divided over , questions about the person and work of Christ , and the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the other persons of the Trinity . \nIn the medieval world , churches devided over the metaphysics of the eucharist , and issues of power and authority . \nIn the twentieth century , churches divided over the role of women in the church , and the politics of race . \nThen came ethical debates about abortion . \nBut in recent years , particularly within Protestantism , homosexuality has become the key battleground issue . \nThe presence and role of gay and lesbian Christians within churches has not only divided liberals and evangelicals , it has also divided ` conservative evangelicals ' from ` progressive evangelicals ' . \nHomosexuality is now , without doubt , the most divisive theological issue facing the world 's major Protestant denominations . \nThe argument within Anglicanism has been likened by some to a theological civil war -- with no sign of a ceasefire anytime soon . \nNow , the Church of Scotland , Scotland 's national church and the mother church of Irish Presbyterianism , is about to face its most challenging debate about homosexuality to date . \nSome say this debate has brought the Church of Scotland closer to schism than any other issue since the Year of Disruption in 1843 . \nNext week , its General Assembly votes on whether a gay minister can be appointed to a parish in Aberdeen . \n`` From a natural justice perspective I feel a justifiable exception would be the fairest manner to deal with the current situation . '' \nThat 's how one MP , in 2006 , tried to claim for a # 3,100 Sony 40 inch TV set . \nThe ` John Lewis List ' suggests that # 750 is a reasonable expense for a television , and no one would deny that MPs need to have access to the media from their home . \nThere 's an engaging dialogue about the ethics of remuneration here , involving two philosophers and a remuneration expert here . \nTest case : One Conservative MP claimed 78p for two tins of pet food . \nIs it ethical to expense your pets ' needs ? \nProfessor James Connelly : This reminds me of Plato 's The Ring of Gyges , where Plato asks : `` What would you do if you put on a ring that made you invisible ? '' \nSome MPs seem to think they were wearing the ring when they put in these claims . \nNow they look pretty stupid . \nBaroness Warnock : Absolutely not . \nThey can feed their own bloody pets . \nLast night , to mark the 30th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher 's election as prime minister , BBC Parliament re-ran the entire TV coverage of election night , presented by a youthful David Dimbleby , with political interviews conducted by Robin Day at the other end of the studio . \nIt was , I am not ashamed to admit , a great night of TV . \nIn her first speech to the cameras , delivered on the steps of Downing Street after returning from the palace , Mrs Thatcher quoted words attributed -LRB- probably wrongly -RRB- to St Francis of Assisi -- and we marked the 800th anniversary of his conversion on last Sunday 's program . \nI thought today it would be interesting to recall a later speech about religion by Mrs Thatcher , in which she appeared to use theology to provide a justification for her political and economic policies . \nThis speech , given to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 1988 , was nicknamed `` the Sermon on the Mound '' by the press -LRB- the mound being the hill upon which the church 's Assembly Hall stands -RRB- . \nRead the speech in full here . \nSo , a woman will lift her head from the sieve of her hands and stare at the minims sung by a tree , a sudden gift . \nSome nights , although we are faithless , the truth enters our hearts , that small familiar pain ; then a man will stand stock-still , hearing his youth in the distant Latin chanting of a train . \nPray for us now . \nGrade 1 piano scales console the lodger looking out across a Midlands town . \nThen dusk , and someone calls a child 's name as though they named their loss . \nInside , the radio 's prayer - -LRB- from Mean Time -LRB- Anvil , 1994 -RRB- -RRB- Listen here to Carol Ann Duffy read some of her poems . \n` Capitalism is nothing but a false religion , with Mammon as its god and Adam Smith as its high priest . ' \n` Communism is nothing but a false religion , with -LRB- INSERT -RRB- as its god and Karl Marx as its high priest .

{"id": "12", "time": "2009-06-16", "text": "Fergus Walsh | 18:17 UK time , Tuesday , 16 June 2009 Your eyes may glaze over at the thought of graphs . \nBut if , like me , you find them useful , then read on . \nI 'm indebted to my colleague Kate Merriam from BBC Research for collating these figures from the World Health Organization website , from the HPA in England and from Health Protection in Scotland . \nBefore the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . \nFirst , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . \nMost of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . \nSecond , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . \nFor example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . \nBut the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . \nThird , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . \nThe CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . \nGiven those caveats , I think the figures are useful . \nGlobal H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . \nAs of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . \nNow let 's look at some individual countries . \nThe number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . \nThere has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . \nYesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . \nHe did not have the virus . \nA further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . \nOf the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . \nThere was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . \nThree cases have been recorded in Wales . \nHealth Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . \n17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . \nThis represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . \n6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . \nThis can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . \nI will try to investigate further . \nYesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . \nProving the virus is incredibly mild , just look at the statistics . \nAnd lets not even mention the CDC saying 19 out of 20 cases go unmissed , its such a weak flu virus right now . \nCDC in new york claim at least half a million cases in NY in may alone . \nUsing the recorded deaths in NY gives us a death rate of ... 0.000024 . \nAt 08:26 am on 17 Jun 2009 , lincolnlerner wrote : The Uk has been tracking this virus for seven weeks with a total of over 1500 cases , as you said the majority of cases will no be fit and well , do we have an actual figure of cases that are currently suffering from the illness , and this would show the general puplic that like with any other flu it is self limiting at the moment , when you see a total of over 1500 you think that is the current figure of cases currently suffering the flu . \nAt 08:40 am on 17 Jun 2009 , pap1976uk wrote : Lincolnlerner - agree with your point , but it would not be possible to collect that sort of data . \nThere is no way of routinely collecting data on how many people are currently suffering . \nObviously it 's great that at the moment the virus is `` mild '' , but even if it does stay that way , it does n't mean we wo n't have severe problems because of it . \nI feel the biggest issue from a public health perspective is the societal impact of large numbers of people having the virus at the same time . \nIt wo n't take much to severely affect health services , not to mention other things we take for granted such as deliveries of food , petrol , and running of transportation systems -LRB- due to staff sickness -RRB- . \nAs a resident of Gloucestershire , I know first hand how one event -LRB- flooding in that case -RRB- can have repercussions on the rest of life . \nThat 's why the authorities are right to be concerned . \nAt 08:43 am on 17 Jun 2009 , pap1976uk wrote : I meant to say , that the only real way of estimating how many people are currently suffering would be to look at the number of recent cases over , say , the past week . \nThat would at least give some indication of current sufferers , but it would only be a rough estimate of course . \nAt 08:40 am on 17 Jun 2009 , pap1976uk wrote : '' ... the biggest issue from a public health perspective is the societal impact of large numbers of people having the virus at the same time . \nIt wo n't take much to severely affect health services , not to mention other things we take for granted such as deliveries of food , petrol , and running of transportation systems -LRB- due to staff sickness -RRB- . \nNow that IS the point , the whole point and nothing but the point . \nPeople -LRB- except virologists and academics -RRB- are n't particularly interested in how many people had the virus four weeks ago . \nThey ARE concerned to try to factor in whatever degree of risk there may be to their interests and functional ability . \nThose interests might be trying to ensure a vulnerable relative is not exposed to the infection , or perhaps business continuity of a company , or local authority , or health trust in the event that the infection rate mushrooms . \nIt 's all wrapped up in that term `` societal impact '' . \nAt 3:32 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , Greenfrogflyinghigh wrote : I can completely take the point about societal impact and I agree that it would seem to be the real -LRB- economic -RRB- threat in this situation . \nHowever , I have an axe to grind about the way there seems to be a reaction to this type of flu that is way out of proportion - I mean new strains of viruses are constantly evolving , many far more virulent and dangerous , so why the huge fuss about this one ? \nThere are , in fact , far more globally endemic diseases that claim millions of lives annually with far too few proactive resources in place in the countries worst affected . \nI have recently traveled back from the UK to a country in the Far East where I live and work . \nI 'm a community development worker in some of the poorest places in this region . \nEach day , each week , each year I am faced with the effects of preventable diseases that are also curable , yet no treatment is available , no effective strategies in place -LRB- despite apparent millions of dollars of aid -RRB- - TB is foremost in my mind , for instance , though I could name many others . \nOfficial figures for this country rate TB infection at 70 % . \nIn the places I work , those without access to healthcare , our estimate is far higher and people are dying . \nChildren are being disabled - yet there is no free medication or treatment program for children and their parents are too ill and too poor to afford drugs . \nDengue - there 's another one . \nThe unacknowledged presence of AIDS which I suspect underlies a large proportion of these fatalities . \nWhy do I mention this on a blog on Swine Flu ? \nWell , on my return here last week I was astounded to see the latest technology monitoring body temperatures as we disembarked . \nAll of a sudden every public place has sprouted disinfectant dispensers so we can all cleanse our hands . \nThe government has produced a flurry of paperwork charting provenance , past travel , contact with foreigners and a part requiring a list of any possible symptoms . \nMy daughter , suffering from jet lag , has been ordered to report to a hospital for tests . \nEverywhere there is paranoia and people react in fear if we , as foreigners , so much as sniffle . \nThis paranoia is fuelled by posters that proclaim the dangers of Swine Flu - today I read with incredulity the bald , unqualified statement , ` This Disease is Fatal to Humans ' What is going on ?? Has the world gone mad ? \nWhy is this such a perceived threat when real killers go untreated ? \nWhy ca n't the resources ploughed into preventing such a mild infection be better targeted ? \nI 'm well aware of the devastation that H1N1 could wreak in one of the villages where I work - but the real problem would not be flu , it would be the pre-existing conditions that should have been recognized and dealt with a long time ago . \nWell , this flu is n't that great a threat in many respects , at least not a ` health ' threat . \nBut it IS an administrative threat , meaning if civil servants and health experts are n't seen to be recommending and taking the best actions it could leave them open to criticism , or losing their jobs , or being sanctioned for poor performance . \nAnd it is a political risk . \nAnd it is a risk , as already suggested , to societal functioning . \nBut in the main , it is not really a significant direct threat to most individual 's personal health . \nBut you do have to factor in that if societal functioning were to be severely hampered by the effects of a flu outbreak , then the risks to an individual 's well-being and health might increase due to lack of access to medics , pharmacists , transport , etc. , etc. . \nOf course , it is also a journalistic risk . \nIf the BBC do n't cover it , Sky or ITV will . \nAnd the BBC is funded to provide public service information as well as entertainment . \nSo that might go some way to answering why there is so much media output about what is probably a comparatively minor risk when compared to some other infections . \nFinally , the number of infected people does have the potential to escalate significantly - whether it actually does that or not - so that is another reason for the quantity of media coverage . \nwould suggest that the West Midlands region has had a higher number of reported and confirmed infections than Scotland per captita . \nThe West Midlands has a slightly higher population -LRB- about 5.3 million -RRB- compared to Scotland -LRB- about 5.1 million -RRB- . \nBut given that the first cases were in Scotland , the rate of spread in the West Midlands would seem to be faster . \nOf course , there could be many other factors in place . \nIf , as may be the case , a higher percentage of the West Midlands cases involve children , then the involvement of medics may be more prevalent and , therefore , there may be better reporting and testing of cases . \nAt 7:22 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , random_thought wrote : Well the graphs certainly still look to be increasing exponentially in countries in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres . \nThe experts -LRB- and the Health Service -RRB- are hoping there will be a summer lull in new cases in the Northern Hemisphere with numbers not rising seriously until the Autumn -LRB- when we should have at least some vaccine stocks in place -RRB- . \nBut I ca n't really see any sign of that yet . \nIt would be interesting to know what the computer models are predicting , and at what point we should see the Northern Hemisphere case rate dropping off for the summer . \nAt 9:06 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , CuriousAddition wrote : Given that London is one of the UK 's most densely populated areas and sees the most amount of flights , I find it surprising that there has n't been more confirmed cases in the capital . \nWe 're almost at 200 now although I 'm sure there could be hundreds more cases that have gone undetected . \nTrue , we have more cases than most parts of the UK but the one place in England that has more than us , the West Midlands has seen far more cases then London and the same with Scotland . \nPerhaps its due to us being one of the warmest parts of the UK on average and thus the higher temperatures stop it from spreading as well as it would do in colder weather . \nWhatever the reason , it is an interesting thing to ponder . \nHopefully , things will not increase here to the degree seen in Birmingham or Glasgow . \nAt 11:25 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , cumbrianOAP wrote : I did not realize , until recently the great importance of taking advised FULL courses of antibiotics , rather than stop taking them as soon as you feel a little better . \nAs this STRENGTHENS the `` BUG 'S '' IMMUNITY TO THE ANTIBIOTIC , HELPING TO BREED SUPER BUGS , which are much , much harder to deal with . \nI think it should be well publicised , and strong warnings of the dangers of not completing full courses of Antibiotics , in Doctors surgery 's and on the Medicine packaging . \nIt is , of course , worth pointing out -LRB- for the avoidance of any doubt -RRB- that antibiotics are thoroughly useless in treating flu itself in the normal course of events . \nThe only time they would be used is in treating the occasional opportunistic bacterial infections that might arise as a secondary result of flu . \nIn the vast majority of cases this does n't happen and antibiotic treatment would be a waste of time . \nThe point about finishing the course of a drug is well made though in general terms . \nNotwithstanding rare side effects that make a drug impossible to continue with , it 's important to complete the course of any treatment to prevent resistance and\\/or reoccurrence of an illness . \nPeople should definitely be made aware of the necessity to complete drug treatments according to the correct instructions . \nAt 5:36 pm on 19 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Tracking does keep one up to date . \nJune 17th appears significant , from Sao Paulo , may not be anything but I will keep checking . \nAt 7:38 pm on 19 Jun 2009 , SkylineOnFire wrote : Sensible old grannie , you are refering to the `` mutation '' reported in sao paolo yes ? \nThat was confirmed by the WHO to have no significance on the virus whatsoever , no increase in virluency , or infection methods , and it has no effect on a vaccine either , essentially it was literally nothing . \nThats why most media didnt report it , everyone was sceptical and proven right , the scientists put out a statement with 99 percent made up information . \nLuckily the masses never got hold of it else it would be panic panic again for a week . \nSO yes , no mutation happened , the strain is the same as before . \nAt 01:42 am on 21 Jun 2009 , Chris wrote : Fergus -

'' \nShe added it was important to get the right balance between complacency and vigilance and that pandemic strategies would vary between countries depending on their specific situation . \nIt is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic Professor John Oxford , flu expert And the WHO does not recommend closure of borders or any restrictions on the movement of people , goods or services . \nBut the picture could change very quickly . \n`` No other pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely , '' Dr Chan said . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm . \n`` Let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease . \nIt is not in itself a cause for alarm , '' he said . \nHe warned that in the developing world the consequences of the virus could be more serious , and that the southern hemisphere was now entering the flu season . \nOne factor which has prompted the move to a level six pandemic was that in the southern hemisphere , the virus seems to be crowding out normal seasonal influenza . \nPandemic ` no cause for alarm ' The move was not prompted by the situation in any one country but the reports that it had spread in several parts of the world , officials said . \nThe BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate . \nExperts have warned that poorer nations , especially those in the southern hemisphere now heading into their winter season , face the greatest risk from the flu pandemic . \nThere have been more than 800 cases in the UK with some areas of Scotland being particularly hard hit . \nThe government has been stockpiling antivirals such as Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine , some doses of which could be available by October . \nSWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but as yet there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said the WHO declaration of a pandemic would not significantly change the way the UK was dealing with swine flu at the moment . \nBut he added there could be some minor changes to who received antivirals . \n`` The declaration of a pandemic per se does n't make a big difference to the way we are handling the outbreaks we have . \n`` We are going to continue to investigate every case that occurs and treat their contacts with antivirals even though they may not be ill . \n`` The difference is that the Health Protection Agency has learned a lot about approaching this question of antiviral prophylaxis and they are going to be treating the closer contacts of the cases , rather than the more far-flung contacts , because they feel that that is supported by what they know so far about how the disease is transmitting . \nHe added : `` These flu viruses can change their pattern of attack , so when we come into the flu season in the autumn and winter in this country , when we expect a big surge of cases , we need to watch very carefully to see if the character of the virus is changing . '' \nThere is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said a move to level six means that countries need to be ready to implement pandemic plans immediately but the UK was already operating at a `` heightened state of readiness '' . \nBut it could affect the speed at which the UK gets pandemic vaccine supplies but that had been factored into pandemic planning . \nFlu expert Professor John Oxford said people should not panic as the outbreak was milder than others seen in the past century . \n`` It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic but I do n't think anyone should worry because nothing drastic has happened between yesterday and today .

This virus can not even mutate into something as bad as the hong kong or asian flu , let alone the spanish influenza of 1918 ! \nIt becomes resistant to tamiflu , which wouldnt be great , but since hardly anyone in the US is being given tamiflu out of the several million suspected cases they have had already , with only 30 deaths or so , most in previously ill people , its really nothing to be incredibly worried about . \nRight now its weaker than regular seasonal flu . \nAnd scientists cant see it getting any worse , it pretty much cant . \nThe media have made the biggest crisis out of this as they can , and im sick of hearing two bit `` experts '' instead of the scientists who actually know about the virus . \nJust my two cents , and Fergus why arent you pointing these things out ? \nI see a lot of very scary headlines and very repetitive trivial news , but not too much in the way of facts ...

'' \nI suspect a cry wolf scenario will develop over the years to come . \nEric de la Harpe , Reading , UK Own shares in some pharmaceutical companies ? \nThen it 's good news so stop worrying . \nThis outbreak of more `` dangerous-than normal flu '' will be a nice boost their income . \nIt 's good to know that these large corporations know how to boost sales in a recession . \nIt is time for people to take some personal responsibility and develop good hygiene practice . \nSadly lacking in many I see using public toilets and not washing their hands . \nCoughing , sneezing and worst of all spiting in public places . \nSince influenza spreads through aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces , it is important to persuade people to cover their mouths while sneezing and to wash their hands regularly Good personal health and hygiene habits , like hand washing , are reasonably effective in avoiding and minimizing influenza . \nIt wo n't stop it but will limit the spread of the virus . \nPlease do n't spread your germs In the US this flu has been mild and the few infected recover quickly . \nI would guess that where there is widespread poverty and malnutrition this flu could be far more fatal . \nSome scientists are saying that a pandemic starts with a mild outbreak in the spring , abates , and then comes roaring back . \nBut this is speculation . \nLooking at the current facts on the ground there is no fear of a pandemic , at least not in North America -LRB- including Mexico -RRB- . \nThe chief cautions would help : avoid eating at restaurants and fast food places , wash your hands often , do not shake hands , avoid having people over to the house . \nAbove all , stay home when sick . \nLet 's hope that no-one in the leaflet distribution depot has swine flu ! \nMore seriously , is this media panic not a glorious opportunity to postpone June 's council elections ? \nIf , as is now believed , this swine flu virus is mild , I think the level of panic is unnecessary . \nSurely , if it is mild , let it spread through the population so that immunity to a more serious outbreak predicted for the autumn can be built up . \nIs this too simple an attitude ? \nYou Sneeze then go and wash your hands . \nBut having washed your hands you then turn off the tap that you last touched with your flu hands and re contaminate your self . \nWe need surgeon style Scrub Up taps that you operate with your elbows . \nWe should NOT be trying to avoid contact with this flu ! \nIt is very mild and by being exposed , we may well get some immunity if it comes back later and more virulent . \nThis is another `` hype '' to make news and to help the governments of the world get away from the money crisis Is this a very strange and rare co-incidence or was it man made ? \nHow can four strains of a virus co-mingle from different continents and become swine flu ? \nNot the hand of god but the hand of man getting an experiment wrong or is it more sinister ? \nNo it 's natural . \nThe Flu 's RNA is in 8 pieces , so if a single cell is infected by more than one strain , those pieces get mixed up and a new strain is formed . \nIt 's totally natural . \nIn readiness for the severe bout of flu which is destined to hit us this winter , why do n't Companies , Schools , Train Stations , Airports , Bus Stations and anywhere people congregate , have bottles of the gel used in hospitals at strategic points , so that anyone passing these points can use the gel . \nIt just may cut down on the numbers of people who may catch any strain of flu . \nA pandemic in the US would be 30 million sick and 3 million dying . \nTo date none , zero , zilch US citizens have died and only a very small hospital size group may or may not be sick . \nThis is just more global warming and Y2K `` consensus '' parading as pseudo science nonsense . \nAlmost everyone has had flu at sometime in their lives and yes it can kill the weak and older people but we live with that on a daily basis . \nThis flu is no different and no more deadly so why all the fuss and media hype - Ever heard of crying wolf ? \nI had a friend at school who was always off because he was ill . \nHis mum sanitised everything and he had to wear coats every time he left the house , even in summer . \nI wonder why he was off all the time ??????? Have not all previous pandemics in Britain occurred at a time before the Second World War , when we were less knowledgeable about transmission and hygiene ?? Not worried at all . \nThis is just the latest variant of the ` we are all going to die horribly ' syndrome that seems to regularly infect people for no logical reason ... nuclear war , new ice age , global warming , Sars , Aids , Millennium bug , foot and mouth , bird flu ... I should be dead many times already if the media are to be believed . \nSwine flu has killed less people than die in road accidents over one weekend , so how about getting a sense of proportion ? \nit 's not exactly Ebola is it ! \nIran or North Korea getting A-bombs is far more worrying but nothing is being done . \nI 'm presuming that this is largely an ingenious plan to stimulate the world economy through creating a rush on medicine and medical products . \nAfter all , who is going to have the greatest ability to produce these - largely the wealthy countries who are `` suffering '' most through the recession . \nYes people have died and that is awful , but I have yet to see any evidence that the problem is as big as we are told it is . \nIf I do , then I will take ` precautions ' . \nI already wash my hands and sneeze into tissues - it 's all basic commonsense ! \nLet 's all have swine ` flu parties now so that we have some immunity for when the more severe form strikes in autumn and winter . \nJo - As an Infection Control Nurse you should allay the fears of your children better than you seemingly have been doing . \nAs for those saying that there should be mass fear because ` some ' people may be more susceptible . \nThis is like saying no one should cross a road because some people are more susceptible to getting knocked over . \nIf you 're got a problem with your sight\\/balance ... do n't go crossing roads unaided . \nIf you 're more susceptible to flu , take better precautions yourself . \nI think that it is over the top and we should all just calm down about it . \nWe should take it with a pinch of salt . \nIs it more dangerous than , for instance : street gangs ? \nOr drink and driving ? \nPlus , if we want to do something about mutant , virulent and resistant viruses , how about treat the problem at the source ? \nFor instance take a good look at animal farming and how it is done ? \nI heard that Swine Flu contains the viral code fragments from : Swine flu from Europe Swine flu from Asia Is this a very strange and rare co-incidence or was it man made ? \nHow can four strains of a virus co-mingle from different continents and become swine flu ? \nNot the hand of god but the hand of man getting an experiment wrong or is it more sinister ? \nThe question should not be ` can we ' , but ` should we ' : Surely the flu organism has aright to share this planet with us - are we mercilessly exterminating it just because it does n't have a furry coat and big brown eyes ? \nEqual rights for flu bugs ! \nIt seems we already have , 1000 cases worldwide , 20 dead and the few that caught it had no more than a sniffle . \nWhat a load of sensationalist rubbish . \nStill it kept the real news off the screen did n't it . \nI think that all the schools in the area should close where the infection has been verified . \nWhen the infection has gone they should return . \nKids mix with other kids from other schools which will tend to be local to there area so there is a good chance to spread those schools too Do we really need the government to tell us to wash our hands , cover our mouth when we cough and use a hankie when we sneeze ? \nI am more concerned about what is going on whilst the government is blowing this out of proportion . \nWhat do they not want us to know ? \nIs it really necessary to send a leaflet to every home in the UK ? \nHow much is this costing ? \nIt seems to be such a worthless exercise . \nMany of the great pandemics in history spread because humans did not change their behavior . \nIt may seem we are overreacting now , but better now than if it mutates or claims more lives , just as flu occasionally does . \nFirstly The 1918 Flu pandemic killed less than 1 % of those it infected - it just infected a lot of people . \nI for one think they should let this ` mild ' version run rampant - so that if it reappears in a more hostile form we will already have immunity . \nLess than 200 have died due to this flu - in the same period over 5000 have died from ` seasonal ' flu . \nPsycho B Delic , Brighton , UK It is strange that when I looked on have your say yesterday there were many recent posts talking about how out of hand the media had become with the way they no longer report news but hype and distort it . \nInteresting that now the Have your say page is ` having technical ' problems and the recent post the BBC have decided to display while the tech problems are sorted out are not these same posts ... Come on BBC news get back to being a decent news provider not a gossip and fear creator This is just the excuse that Governments need to bring in more draconian measures to ` protect ' the public whilst eroding their civil liberties . \nStop listening to the hype and get a life . \nThis is flu and some people will die from it but the overwhelming majority will survive with no lasting effects - just like any other flu . \nWHO has unfortunately blown this one completely out of proportion and as a result , this panic is affecting markets around the world . \nIn the economic climate in which we currently are , bodies like the UN , OECD etc. should be extremely careful in making dire pronouncements . \nUnfortunately the UN type pundits are not directly affected by market vacillations and they frequently jeopardize others lives by their `` erudite predictions '' . \nI hope there is a law against these people . \nYawn , yawn , yawn . \nMild flu grabs the headlines and everyone is making a meal of it . \nFirstly , I think everyone should adhere to proper hygiene that means using warm\\/hot water and washing hands with soap\\/anti-bacterial liquid handwash , do n't just run your hands under a cold tap that is n't going to kill germs that may be on your hands & under finger nails . \nPerhaps some hand gel through every door with the information leaflet on avoiding spreading germs ? \nI think this country has poor hygiene standards to start with . \nThe amount of times I have been in a public toilet and watched in horror as women leave without washing their hands ! \nIt does not inspire confidence in the general publics ability to take extra precautions if they already find basic hygiene a challenge ?! Some shock tactics would heighten peoples awareness . \nCould we place pictures of heighlighted germs on taps and door handles in public toilets ? \nThe TV ads and the leaflet , what a complete waste of money , telling us things like use a tissue if you sneeze . \nWhat a dumbed down country we have become . \nTotally overblown and a fuss about nothing Easy way to avoid the pandemic : Forget about it . \nEven if it reaches your area , the chances of catching it by person-to-person infection are very low . \nEven then , just go and get some Tamiflu and go home . \nChris Horner , Wakefield West Yorkshire People could stop being so selfish and irresponsible when they have a couch or cold and try using a hanky ! \nThey could also stay home to avoid passing it on . \nI think it is up to countries how they curb the spread of swine flu . \nThese governments have one mission in mind which is to prevent the transmission of the swine flu . \nWHO is not helping in any way by telling governments not to close borders . \ni mean we are scared for our lives and hence look up to our governments to protect us . \nthis means they have to do anything to protect us and if that means closing borders then that has to be done . \nAt the moment swine flu does n't seem dangerous outside Mexico . \nWould it not be better if we catch it now , -LRB- rather than in winter when they say it will be worse , -RRB- so we then develop immunity and do n't get it when its a worse form ? \nDoes anyone know why authorities are not doing this ? \nThe Media , as usual , have blown it completely out of proportion . \nOn Monday night 's BBC news there was a report of a ` MASS breakout ' of flu at a school that had subsequently closed . \nWere 600 pupils infected ? \nNO - there were 6 pupils infected !!! Since when has 6 pupils in a group of a few hundred or more constituted MASS ? \nTry giving us the facts instead of a deluge of spin and hype . \nMy advice would be to switch of the TV news and cancel your newspapers - it 's no worse than any other flu that we 've been exposed to ! \nHere in Hong Kong , the response has been quick and very efficient . \nSome may say an over-reaction by the people , or scaremongering by the government . \nHowever in a country which suffered so badly during SARS and one where H5N1 flu has been encountered , who can blame anyone ? \nThere are more people on the streets in masks but they 're a fairly common sight anyway . \nOtherwise people do n't seem overly concerned and it is business as usual . \nRichard Ackroyd , Tung Chung , Hong Kong Sneezing into 1 . \na tissue or 2 . \nones sleeve are essential habits left over from the time of the Black plague . \nIn China they also take off their outdoor shoes and wear indoor slippers , also provided for guests . \nIt was learned by hard experience in the land where both swine and bird flu originate . \nWould n't this be another useful habit to encourage here ? \nWe need to have this flu if our immune systems are to remain strong . \nIf we insist on living in near sterile conditions we are making ourselves more vulnerable . \nThe more pertinent question is `` How do we contain the media driven panic ? '' \nYou 're supposed to be a public service - not a scaremonger\\/gossip machine . \nDid you know that , worldwide -LRB- over the last 12 months -RRB- , over 5000 people have died from ` seasonal ' flu ... Man up . \nI live in Hong Kong and was here during the SARS outbreak . \nBoth that and the Swine Flu have been horribly over blown - the reaction has been extreme and costly . \nThere are flu outbreaks every year . \nIn the US 36,000 people every year year die of it . \nIn that context this outbreak is insignificant . \nWhy the big fuss about this particular strain ? \nWe probably ca n't avoid spread of an infection that could be brought in from any country in the world now - so we should not try to quarantine any suspected infected person . \nall we can do is take sensible precautions to minimize spread within families and workplaces . \nIt is only flu ! \nThe mortality rate is not known but appears to be very low and most people are not seriously ill . \nlets have some perspective from media reports please . \nThrowing the full might of precautions put in place to fight a ` deadly ' H1N5 flu on a milder H1N1 flu seems wastful and costly . \nThere will be carnage if this outbreak is followed by Bird flu and all the anti-virals have been used up or anti-viral resistance gets passed on to H1N5 . \nThe `` pandemic '' scare serves to keep many highly paid doctors and scientists in jobs at flu crisis centres all over the world . \nIf there are no scares they loose their job , so we are guaranteed a good scare every couple of years -- remember the bird flu which was going to kill us all . \nThe trouble is that to keep their taxpayer funded jobs , they ruin the livelihoods of thousands of people , poultry farmers and pig farmers spring to mind . \nThey should be made to pay their salaries in reparation . \nIf this happened I and sure the number of scares would drop drastically . \nI am astonished and disgusted by the number of people who sneeze without covering their noses and mouths . \nI thought this was something everyone learned at their mother 's knee . \nI 'd like to know why spitting is also not listed this a known way of some viruses being spread . \nI can not see this mentioned . \nNothing is that brilliant here in the UK we have people wandering around yet a third world country takes more proactive approach with scanners . . ! \nMark E said the the high death toll in 1918 was `` a consequence of 4 years of war and resulting stress , poor health care and diet . '' \nThis is not true . \nThe 1918 flu killed the strongest people . \nThis was because the 1918 flu caused the immune system to overreact : those with strong and healthy immune systems overreacted most and died . \nThe weaker members of society , ironically , had a better chance of surviving . \nI am not taking any precautions . \nI have just as much chance of getting ordinary flu as I am of getting swine flu and if what everybody is saying is true it wont be any worse . \nWhere was all the precaution awareness in winter when the flu was going around then ? \nPeople still became ill and hospitalised where was all the government warning then ? \nThe same preventative measures apply as well . \nAt this time , the virus is relatively benign . \nThe only way to be protected is to get immunity . \nIn the great Spanish Flu , those that got it the first time around were much more likely to survive the following waves . \nQuite frankly , I would really like to be exposed to this virus now while the symptoms are mild , so that I can develop immunity . \nI 'm beginning to think that the hysterical isolation of all infected persons may be what will make future waves more lethal From what experts say , the most worrying possible outcome would be , if the strain mutated into a much harmful form and came back with strength during the autumn flu season . \nWould it be better if we all caught the mild form now ? \nIt 's as simple as that . \nAs a Government , all that realistically can be done is to ensure that sufficient treatments are on hand to help those infected to recover . \nHappily , it appears that in the UK we have amassed a large enough stockpile . \nI have already had spam scam e-mails trying to sell me cut-price Tamiflu and\\/or utterly useless protective masks . \nThe tone of these has been `` buy this drug\\/mask now or die , or your family will die , the choice is yours '' This sort of thing really makes the red-mist descend . \nPhilip Le Roux , Aldershot Hampshire The good thing is that more information is available through TV and the web . \nThe bad thing is that there 's so much information being sent out it 's difficult to absorb what 's right and wrong . \nTaking the usual cleanliness precautions is good . \nMost people have already been vaccinated against previous flu strains . \nSo we all have some built-in immunity against this new strain . \nJon Schuller , Charlotte , NC USA It seems to me we are eventually going to reap what we have sown . \nIf you intensively breed and farm animals and keep them in overcrowded , unclean conditions , disease is going to spread . \nParts of Mexico City remain deserted in a bid to stop the disease spreading If I hear the word pandemic once more , I will scream . \nI can not believe the amount of hype attached to this non issue . \nPeople get the flu every year , and yes some people die . \nThis is a weak strain and not avian flu . \nLet 's move on . \nI think we are lucky to have the media communications that make it possible for us to know almost immediately when there is a potential flu outbreak . \nWe are also very lucky to have government programs made to monitor such cases . \nWithout the communications and knowledge we have today these flu outbreaks could very easily turn out like the flu epidemic of 1918-1920 . \nI think that we do not have to become crazy as this illness is affecting all the world but as long as we respect , and follow all the measures , we can help to avoid the spread of it . \nWhile sympathising with those who have died , most who catch the virus live . \nWhile some countries are over-reacting to this swine flu epidemic there is no hiding the fact this virus will spread irrespective of draconian airport procedures , quarantining measures or culling pigs . \nI think the poverty pandemic will kill more people in the third world through starvation , malnutrition , lack of clean drinking water , malaria , typhoid , cholera , sleeping sickness etc. . \nMaybe if we spent the swine flu money on those `` items '' instead more lives would be saved . \nHow convenient that swine flu came at a time when it could take our minds off economic meltdown ! \nFace masks are utterly useless as a defense system ! \nThe only use of them is for sufferers , to prevent them coughing and sneezing their viruses to the rest of mankind ... in fact , when worn in defense , they definitely do far more harm than good ! \nKeep your hands clean -LRB- wash with soap and water , or better still an alcohol-based cleanser , regularly -RRB- , and ` catch coughs and sneezes in your handkerchiezes ! ' \n, you know , just as we did in the 50s ! \nIn my opinion countries need to be far better prepared in these days of global mass transportation , by ensuring that Airports and to a degree , all Sea-ports use correct monitoring not just at arrivals but also at the point of departures . \nBy using thermal cameras and to have health officials and computers with health information in multiple languages are available etc. . \nAlso on long haul flights and cruses if a passenger -LRB- s -RRB- is found to be unwell , and displaying the right type of symptoms that they are tested and other passengers informed , and given preventative treatment and specialist advice , also major events should be postponed the F.A cup for example . \nMatthew Jones , Barry , UK The Swine Flu Pandemic can be controlled just like Mexico is doing . \nIf a country manages to avoid crowded gatherings , it will cut the beginning of the spread of the disease . \n"}
{"id": "629", "time": "2009-05-06", "text": "Technology Reporter , BBC News , Silicon Valley 20,000 plus new samples of malware are detected every day , say experts Twelve million computers have been hijacked by cyber-criminals and detected by security vendor McAfee since January , the firm has said . \nIt reports there has been a 50 % increase in the number of detected so-called `` zombie '' computers since 2008 . \nThe true number of newly hijacked PCs is likely to be higher than those detected by McAfee alone . \nThe figures come as a report from Deloitte said a global approach to cyber-security was needed . \n`` Doing nothing is not an option , '' said Deloitte 's Greg Pellegrino . \nEverything that depended on cyberspace face unprecedented risks , said Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu -LRB- DTT -RRB- . \n`` This issue is moving so quickly , and with so much at stake economically and in terms of safety and security for people , we do n't have 100 years to figure this out , '' explained Mr Pellegrino , who is a global public sector industry leader at DTT . \nMcAfee also revealed that the United States now hosted the world 's largest percentage of infected computers at 18 % with China a not too distant second with just over 13 % . \n`` The massive expansion of these botnets provides cyber-criminals with the infrastructure they need to flood the web with malware , '' said Jeff Green , senior vice-president of McAfee . \n`` Essentially , this is cyber-crime enablement . '' \nThe DTT findings revealed a growing awareness of the role the internet plays in so many different aspects of our lives from security to commerce and from transportation to communication . \nBetter cyber-security measures will benefit global commerce , says the report `` We are seeing this change from protecting the internet to a conversation about how we succeed and prosper in cyberspace , '' Mr Pellegrino told the BBC . \n`` Security spending is growing at a rate never seen before while the threat environment is growing at a pace of 40 % a year . \n`` In terms of volume and severity of incidents , the math does n't work and we have to come up with a different approach that requires public and private sectors working together , '' Mr Pellegrino said . \n`` We are talking about daily living , '' said fellow author Gary McAlum , who is a retired US Air Force colonel and senior manager of security and privacy services at Deloitte . \n`` There is a lot of discussion about the economy and the military and the public and private sector , but we have now reached a sense of urgency about the interconnectedness of all these areas . '' \nThat view was echoed by a member of the US military top brass who just gave evidence to a branch of the House Armed Services Committee . \n`` Our economy , the nation 's critical infrastructure , and many of our military operations depend on unfettered access to cyberspace , '' said Lt Gen Keith Alexander , the director of the National Security Agency -LRB- NSA -RRB- who also heads the Pentagon 's new Cyber Command . \n`` Maintaining freedom of action in cyberspace in the 21st Century is as inherent to US interests as freedom of the seas was in the 19th Century , and access to air and space in the 20th Century . '' \nHe has called for the creation of a digital warfare force for the future and has stated that the US needs to reorganise its offensive and defensive cyber-operations . \nThe Deloitte study included interviews conducted with government officials and industry experts from around the world . \nWhile it revealed a patchwork approach to the problem it also showed it was one that was gaining prominence . \nThere are 32,000 suspected cyber-attacks every 24 hours , says the NSA `` We were very pleased that there was a similar tone and awareness and leadership effort coming from different countries across the world , '' Mr Pellegrino said . \n`` Clearly this particular issue has a different context depending on where you are in the world . \nWe can not afford to go backwards . '' \nIn America , President Obama has made the issue of cyber-security a priority . \nShortly after taking office he ordered a 60-day review that has now been delivered to his desk . \nIt is understood the release of the review has been delayed by the ongoing H1N1 swine flu crisis . \nWhen the report is made public , it is expected that the president will also announce his choice for cyber-security tsar to lead the charge . \nWhile the Deloitte research said security in Asia-Pacific needed to `` catch up '' it noted that the United Kingdom was in the process of writing a national cyber strategy with an emphasis on public-private partnership . \nOn the continent , the European Commission has urged member states to co-ordinate on cyber-security measures , while in Latin America the report authors conclude that there is a `` diversity of approaches '' . \nCanada has completed its own cyber-security review and this year will be implementing the National Cyber-Security Strategy as well as creating a new Directorate of Cyber-Security with a mandate to engage closely with the private sector . \nDespite all these efforts , the Deloitte authors point out that time is of the essence . \n`` Not only do we have to take action , we do n't have enough time , '' warned Mr Pellegrino . \nMr McAlum agreed and said mapping a clear strategy was crucial . \n`` We need to get our house in order first so that we can interact with the rest of the world with one voice , with clear roles and responsibilities aligned .

'' \nUS : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 3 confirmed , 13 probable cases The Netherland , Switzerland , Austria : 1 confirmed case each Peru case now ` unconfirmed ' by national government She added : `` The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the EU for an event such as this for some years now , and the experience gained so far , puts us in a much stronger position . '' \nNone of the dozens of cases of swine flu reported on the continent so far has been severe . \nThe health ministers agreed to work `` without delay '' with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine . \nRejecting the French plan on suspending flights to Mexico - the main focus of the outbreak - they said it was up to member states to set their own policies . \nSeveral countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . \nEarlier the UN 's World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- - which increased its pandemic alert to five on Wednesday - said it had no immediate plans for a further rise . \n`` We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today , or any such move is imminent right now , '' said WHO Assistant Director General Keiji Fukuda . \nThe White House said a security aide who had helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico has become sick with flu-like symptoms The Netherlands confirms its first case of swine flu , in a three-year-old boy recently returned from Mexico . \nCases have also been confirmed in Switzerland and Costa Rica The number of confirmed cases in the US rose to 109 in 11 states Japan reported its first suspected case of swine flu Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said tests on Peru 's sole suspected case had proved negative , reversing an earlier statement SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection In Mexico , the number of confirmed cases rose to 260 - up from 26 on Wednesday , something experts attributed to many laboratory results coming in . \nThe Mexican government increased the number of confirmed deaths from swine flu from 8 to 12 . \nPresident Felipe Calderon has urged people to stay at home over the next five days . \nThe US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico . \nMeanwhile the WHO says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human . \nEgypt has begun a mass slaughter of its pigs , and Ghana is the latest country to ban pork imports as a precaution against swine flu . \nHave you been affected by swine flu ? \nYou can send your experiences using the form below . \nA selection of your comments may be published , displaying your name and location unless you state otherwise in the box below . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . \n"}
{"id": "1113", "time": "2009-05-01", "text": "Swine Flu : Your questions answered More cases of swine flu have been confirmed across the globe , while in Mexico the number of suspected deaths linked to the virus is reported to be more than 160 . \nJohn McConnell is Editor of The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal One person has died in the US and cases have now been confirmed in 12 countries over three continents . \nMexican officials say the spread of the virus is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . \nThe World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert to five , the second-highest level , but says it has no immediate plans for another rise . \nHere John McConnell , editor of the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal , answers a selection of your questions about the epidemic . \nHow can you differentiate swine flu from the common and seasonal flu ? \nMvula Zakeyo , Lusaka , Zambia How do the symptoms of swine , or `` novel '' flu differ from those of a regular flu , if at all ? \nIt would most likely ease widespread panic if people knew what to look for aside of sneezing and nausea . \nAdam Cullen , Tallinn , Estonia Mr McConnell : Unless you have access to a virology laboratory , you probably ca n't distinguish the two . \nSymptoms of swine and seasonal flu include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , headache , chills , and fatigue . \nPatients do seem to be reporting diarrhoea and vomiting more often with swine flu than is the case for `` normal '' flu , but in practice the two forms are probably indistinguishable . \nI was surprised to be told that wearing masks can actually increase the risk of getting the infection rather than not wearing one at all . \nThe area around your mouth and nose becomes very warm and moist , which is a perfect breeding ground for the virus and that wearing a mask does not reduce the risk at all because it can filter through the holes . \nSamantha , Redditch Mr McConnell : The virus breeds in tissues of the respiratory tract , not on the skin however warm and damp it may get . \nSurgical masks , as seem to be handed out in Mexico , are designed to prevent transmission of disease rather than prevent its acquisition . \nMasks will certainly become less effective as they become damp and more porous , so masks would have to be changed several times per day to be of any value . \nThe UK government has not stockpiled masks as part of its pandemic preparedness plan , although there have been reports of the government now ordering supplies of masks . \nThe Spanish Pandemic killed mainly due to cytokine storms which I understand to be the immune system overreacting . \nIs the swine flu similar ? \nIf so , would drugs to lower the immune system in young adults with the virus help lower mortality rate ? \nTrebor Evans , Llandudno , North Wales Mr McConnell : There is no evidence as yet that the Mexican swine flu virus causes the so-called cytokine storm . \nI would be very wary about doing anything to dampen the immune response of someone ill with flu . \nThere is so much publicity on the swine flu . \nHow do we know that the flu has become pandemic at a more local level ? \nWhat precautions should the general public who do not travel to any infected region take to minimize the risk of infection ? \nDoes a rise the temperature contribute to the spread of the virus ? \nRozie A R , Sg Buloh , Selangor , Malaysia Mr McConnell : We will know the virus is causing local epidemics when there is a continuous chain of transmission from one person to the next within a country . \nThere is no guaranteed way to avoid infection while carrying on the activities of daily life . \nEmployers should instruct staff who do not feel well to not come to work . \nPeople who feel ill should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice rather than trying to visit the clinic . \nThe flu virus seems to prefer cooler winter temperatures , for reasons we do n't understand , hence the annual winter flu seasons . \nI am on immune suppressant medication for rheumatoid arthritis . \nWhat implications does this have if I come into contact with swine flu ? \nSusan Seal , Birmingham Mr McConnell : You may be more liable to become infected by the virus if you come into contact with it , and the infection may cause more severe illness . \nYou should consult your GP for advice on this question . \nIs the virus strain in Mexico stronger than that in the US and elsewhere ? \nDoes it have to do with the treatment , immunity , or something else ? \nEneida Rista , Tirana , Albania Mr McConnell : I wish we knew . \nThe virus does not seem to differ inside and outside Mexico . \nAccess to healthcare may be poorer in Mexico , hence the apparently high mortality rate , but we do n't have enough data on illness and death among confirmed cases to even say whether the apparent high mortality rate is `` real '' . \nI understand that Mexico City has a population of almost 9 million . \nAssuming a large proportion of the population has been exposed to the virus is n't 150 deaths rather a small figure , probably surpassed by what we would normally expect as a seasonal outbreak ? \nJohn Williams , Bromley Mr McConnell : Similar to the answer to Eneida Rista 's question above , we do n't yet have sufficient data to determine whether the mortality rate is exceptional . \nWhat is clear is that the Mexican swine flu virus is a variant of the H1N1 virus new to human beings , is not the same as the seasonal flu viruses that have been circulating this year , and is causing illness and death among human beings . \nWhy are drugs companies permitted to recommend that workers with seasonal flu take a flu remedy and continue at work when infectious and yet we have a panic over swine flu with isolation ? \nCould the Health Protection Agency work with drugs companies and employers to remind individuals that seasonal flu is contagious , serious and that if you do have flu you must stay at home to minimize risk of transmission ? \nMaybe I 'm a cynic but is this not all hyped up to take our collective eyes off the deepening economic situation ? \nJean Howard , Street , Somerset Mr McConnell : I think the point you are getting at is that drugs against flu are marketed on the basis that they reduce the duration of illness and thus allow earlier return to work . \nThe reason that the NHS does not prescribe Tamiflu and Relenza routinely is that the drugs are expensive and flu is for most otherwise healthy people a self-limiting illness from which they will recover within a week or so . \nI agree that people who are ill with flu should stay at home and not risk spreading it to work mates or traveling companions . \nIndeed , if you have flu you will know about it and not want to get out of bed for a couple of days . \nAnyone who tells you they 've had `` a touch of flu '' has had a cold - flu is far more debilitating than a cold . \nA flu pandemic will likely deepen the economic recession , so it 's not the diversionary tactic I would have chosen were I in government ! \nI do n't understand why this is so important . \nOnly nine people out of hundreds of millions have died from this . \nDo n't more die everyday from regular flu ? \nAre n't there other more serious illnesses that are killing people ? \nHope Lomas , Chagrin Falls Ohio USA Mr McConnell : Around the world , every day thousands of people are dying of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria . \nAIDS is treatable , tuberculosis and malaria are curable . \nDiarrhoeal and respiratory diseases , which are almost certainly infectious in origin , kill millions of children under the age of five every year . \nEven in the fat , wealthy developed world , infectious diseases such as pneumonia -LRB- particularly among the elderly -RRB- and sepsis -LRB- particularly among those with underlying medical conditions -RRB- kill hundreds of thousands of people every year . \nIndeed , overall , infectious diseases cause 15-20 million deaths every year - the cause of about one third of all deaths . \nSwine flu is notable because it 's an exceptional event , something above the everyday toll of deaths caused by infectious diseases . \nA pandemic similar to that of 1918-19 , which killed at least 50 million people , would be a catastrophic event because it would double annual worldwide mortality . \nHowever , I think the chances of a repeat of 1918-19 are very small . \nWhat swine flu , and the media reaction to it , does highlight is our willingness to accept the `` routine '' toll of infectious diseases with little apparent concern . \nHowever , `` Mother dies of TB in Zambia and infects her three children '' is not a headline that sells many papers . \nMr McConnell : A short and sweet answer : Yes . \n"}

suspected in more than 160 deaths - is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . \nChina has now confirmed its first case , taking the tally of nations hit to 14 . \nA Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong via Shanghai tested positive for the virus , said Hong Kong 's leader , Donald Tsang . \nThe hotel in which the man briefly stayed in Hong Kong has been cordoned off and the alert level raised to emergency , although the authorities have urged residents not to panic . \nIn cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . \nThe WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . \nThe shut-down in Mexico covers two public holidays and a weekend . \nUS : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases Israel , Costa Rica : 2 confirmed cases each The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission City authorities say initial evidence suggests infection rates there are slowing . \nSome factories will stop production and schools are already closed . \nResidents have been urged to stay at home . \nBut some people say they will ignore it because they can not afford not to work . \nThere is also growing concern at the effect the virus could have on Mexico 's already-struggling economy . \nThe number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . \nMexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . \nThe virus is suspected of causing more than 160 other deaths . \nAnnouncing the figures , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . \n`` The fact that we have a stabilisation in the daily numbers , even a drop , makes us optimistic , '' he said . \nBut Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization , said fluctuations were to be expected . \n`` If it did n't do that -LRB- it -RRB- would be very unusual , '' he said . \nThe US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , AP reports , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Mexico says it will lodge a formal challenge at the World Trade Organisation demanding explanations from countries that have banned imports of Mexican pork products On Thursday European health ministers held an emergency meeting on measures to tackle the virus , which has now been confirmed in seven European countries . \nSYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said Europe was well prepared to handle swine flu and there was `` no need to panic '' . \nThe ministers agreed to work with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine , but rejected a French plan to suspend flights to Mexico . \nSeveral countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . \nThe WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu -

{"id": "441", "time": "2009-05-01", "text": "On 1st March we moved to a new blogging system . \nThe archives of all the student , teacher and staff blogs are still available here to read but commenting has closed . \nHere is the link to the new system : First of all , I want to thank everyone put his comment on the first entery and I promise I will reply to most of these comments as soon as possible ! \nUnfortunately , my second entery is not that pleasent . \nOn the last few days the world was stunned by the news of the outbreak of swine flu epidemic . \nHere in Egypt , people are terrified especially after they learned that this disease is fatal and can be transferred from ahumanbeing to another , and there is a general pessimistic attitude throughout most of Egyptian community . \nAs a full-time pharmacist in a community pharmacy , I can tell how people are deepely concerned . \nMany customers , who enter the pharmacy these days , with common cold symptoms ca n't now treat this whole matter simply as the past and some of them do n't hesitate to ask me if they cought swine flu . \nAlso , I used to be asked about the availability of `` Tmiflu '' and protective masks . \nOf course I answer these poor patients with a big a smile on my face that there 's nothing to worry about with many of `` Stop it ! '' \nand `` Do n't bother yourself ! '' . \nFrankly speaking , I 'm really ... . \nreally worried and afraid to some extent . \nMedically speaking , Most types of influinza , including the swine type , share the same symptoms of the the regular flu and we ca n't reach an exact diagnosis without laboratory test . \nAlso , the WHO says that the current anti-influinza vaccines and the widely known antiviral drug `` Tamiflu '' showed little effectiveness against swine flu . \nAdded to that , I 'm not sure that using protective musks is adequate to protect ourselves from this virus whish is still classified as the strongest micro organism on earth . \nAbsolutely disappointing !!!!!!! Is n't it ? \nBut have you realized that some international reactions was to some sort childish and showing a great degree of lack of responsibility and even sense towards an epedimic that threats the all humanbeings ? \nEspecially , these animal rights defending organizations who condemned the Egyptian authorities disicion to slaughter all pigs as a preemptive action to avoid a swine flu outbreak in Egypt . \nVery rediulous !!!! So what to do ? \nJust wait and see ! \nThe WHO says that a time period of 3 to 6 monthes is needed after the isolation and the identification of the genetic map `` genome '' of the virus to produce an effective vaccine . \nUntil that time , we should follow strictly the widely known precautions including washing hands properly , wearing protective masks , which I still do n't believe in its effectiveness , avoid the change of climate and , of course , stop eating pork . \nNext entery , I promise , will be less disappointing ! \nI know that the title may be a little bit strange , but it was just to tell you that I call your name withot the proper way `` Mrs Rachel '' to avoid violation of the friendly image of the blog . \nI hope that it wo n't be percieved as a humulation or a disrespect to you . \nAnyhow , I want to ask you to stress in your next enteries on the proper use of punctuation marks . \nBesides , I will wait impatiently for your tips and remarks on my way of writing to enhance my writing skills and make my essays more understandable and acceptable . \nOn the other hand , I consider speaking is the most troublemaking skills for me . \nDue to the nature of my proffission as a pharmacist and the location of the pharmacy I have to speak English , in many cases , to native speakers . \nYou ca n't imagine how terrible I become when I have to speak , my face flushes and I sweat heavily and my body temperature spikes suddenly , and how many naieve mistakes Imake . \nFor example , a British woman came to the pharmacy to buy her medicine and after I gave it to her I asked her , when I realized her accent , `` Mam , you seems to be British '' She smiled and saied , '' Yes '' I think you now noticed how bad I need to fix this ability of fluent speaking . \nComments on many comments : -RRB- Oh my God ! \nI do n't believe that the first week passed so quickly like that ! \nAnyway , this is the proper time to reply to some of your wonderful comments I was impressed and surprised that my introductory entery recieved 20 comments . \nThat was a very warm welcomming attitude I have never expected ! \nOn the other side , I have to tell you that my enteries focus intensively on parts of everyday life in Egypt which , as I think , you will not read about in tourism booklets and , maybe , you ca n't have the chance to learn about when you visit Egypt as tourists . \nI hope this will not disappoint you . \nCheik Vall from Mauritania and Soroush from Toronto : The advice about avoiding eatin pork was said by many well known physicians and specialists in Egypt . \nI know that this disease is airbourne , but I think that this virus has the strength and the fatality of bird flu -LRB- H5N1 -RRB- and the ability to transfer from a human to another of the human flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . \nThis makes the way of the disease transfer unpredictable . \nThis is , of course , regardless to the other health hazards of eating pork and the fact that Islam bans eating pork which needs no notice . \nHere in Egypt we have alot of well-equipped labs that can analyze thousands of samples within short time . \nI think that the real problem is not the availablity of equipments . \nIt 's all about how to control the outbreak of the swine flu if happened . \nThis is the chief concern of everyone in the globe . \nCristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : I ca n't agree more with most of what you said except about eating pork and the role of pigs in this dilemma . \n3-To Rachel , with all respect : -RRB- Also the huge number of comments was absolutely impressive . \nI ca n't tell you how grateful I am . \nThanks alot for your supportive comments and useful advices . \n4 - Dusting dusty dustingly dust !!!!!!! You are 100 % right . \nSpring is not supposed to be that bad , but this is the bitter truth in Egypt . \nActually , autumn is the best season in the year in Egypt . \nUnfortunately , it 's the beginning of schools activities , so , I can rarely enjoy the fine weather of this season , Cristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : Well , the sales was n't that good in this day . \nIt was another slow day . \nAnyway , every thing emproved after that . \nActually , I am afraid of that too !!!!!! But I can do nothing !!!! Wish me a good luck , brother !!!! It 's nice to know that Egypt is not alone in suffering . \nThanks Hyoshi Thanks again for your sweet comments and I apologize for those whom I did n't reply to their comments . \nonce upon atime in a line ! \nHow long have you standed in a line inside or outside a bilding to do any thing ? \nAnd what was the longst duratione you have done that ever ? \nWell , letme break your personal records !!!!! So , ladies and gentelmen ! \nNow we will celebrate the new world record !!!!! SIX HOURS !!!!!! HURRAY !!!!!!!!!!!!! Ladies and Gentelmen , let 's applause to our Herooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!! Seriously , Egyptians , especially in Cairo , are used to this kind of tidious activity . \nThis is supposed to be natural especially if we are talking a bout a big city with more than 20 million residents . \nAn Egyptian journalist described that as '' The worst and most brutal punishmint for your sins ! '' \nThree weeks ago , I had to go to the National Records authority to issue a new copy of this : Egyptian identity card : image removed by BBC Learning English This is the `` The national ID card '' which is the most important document in an ordinary Egyptian life . \nIn fact , you ca n't make a passport , enroll in courses or buy a car without it , and in many cases your identity is denied if you missed yours ! \nActually , I had to change some details in my ID in order to issuing other important documents . \nAnd that was the very begining of the story . \n10.00 am : I reached the national records building . \nI supposed it was early ... . . \nWhat a stupid thought ! \nUnfortunately , I found an extremely long line of people extended from the basement to the first floor , department of national IDs . \nSo , I have to take my position in that line . \nSome people told me that they were here from 7.00 am till this moment !!!!!!!! 11.00 am : The line moved slowly and I put my exhausted feet on the stairs towards my destination . \n12.00 am : The electrecity cut off suddenly ! \nThis meant , with no doubt , many other precious minuets would be wasted just like that ! \n1.00 pm : The electricity was back ... . . \nThe line resumed moving with the same slow speed after meaningless stop . \n3.00 pm : Finally , I reached the clerk responsible for finishing my papers . \nBut that was n't the end of the suffering . \nShe , by the way she was a woman , showed me an ugly smile and said , `` This is the end of my shift ! \n... ... ... . . \nPlease , do n't lough !!!!! 4.00 pm : After another hour of waiting that left me and rest of the people very furious , the other clerk arrived . \nMe and the people behind me were so exhausted and tired , my blood pressure dropped and I was near to faint , to blame that man or yell on him . \nHe finished my paper and this drama , that seemed to be endless , reached its end ! \nFinding a bus that drove me home was n't that difficult and I layed down on my bed on 5.45 pm !!!!!! Thanks alot for your last enteries , especially the last one . \nThey were absolutely useful . \nI 've read the leaflet and , as you , found it strange to read an expression like '' flu friend ' . \nBut actually , the statement '' Catch it , Bin it , Kill it '' is my favorite . \nThis reminds me with a widely used term in medical books '' Typhoid Marry '' . \nMarry was a cook used to process meals to many high class families in USA in the third decade of 20th century . \nMany children and even elderly members of these families died with typhoid that was a fatal bacterial disease at this time . \nPhysicians found typhoid in the samples of food prepared by Marry and , later on , in her blood smear . \nShe had typhoid in her blood but did n't harm her . \nNowadays , This term is used to define people like Marry who can spread a dangerous disease , viral or bacterial , unitentionally . \nIn another words , they are called `` carriers '' You are right about new situations that give birth to new words . \nThis is also true about Arabic . \nAnyway , languages are described to be adaptable , I spent more than ten minuets to remember this word . \nOn the other hand , new situations can give '' life kiss '' to some words that was thought to be burried forever in language books . \nFor example , many English language students , like me , had to deal with words like `` terrorism '' , `` tolerance '' , `` mass destruction weapons '' , `` pre-amptive '' , ... . \netc after 9\\/11 attacks . \nDuring the swine flu crisis , many people I meet and many TV programs presenters used the word H1N1 in stead of swine flu . \nI thaught that this word would still forever used only by medical specialists . \nI was , as usual , wrong . \nThat 's it for now . \nSee you soon , Rachel . \nOh yes , I caught flu and I am very sick . \nActually , I did n't figure out the cause , but I realize that I have to move temporarily from being a flu friend to a flu victim or even a flu prey . \nI am just fine right now and it seems like I will pass this anyway . \nIn one of your enteries you said , `` Could you take some photos of yourself at work ? \nI am interested to see what your pharmacy looks like ! '' \nWell , Rachel , I ca n't refuse any thing you ask . \nI took some photos of the most important moments in my work day . \nSo , let 's begin . \n10.00 am : I open the pharmacy doors myself Now , it 's time to clean up all this mess of the previous busy night . \nI have never been good in cleening my room and making it tidy , and it was hard at first to do that in pharmacy . \nBy time , the whole task has become easier . \nI used to sweep this floor then clean it using a mop every day ... ... Not bad for a young man , is n't it ? \nIt 's the time to have my morning tea break . \nI drink one cup of tea with milk two times daily . \nAfter a while , my mother comes to the pharmacy . \nShe is the manager . \nShe is a kind woman , but when it comes to work she becomes serious . \nI learned from her many things about managing the pharmacy and how to make my pharmaceutical information very useful . \nShe is a good pharmacist and a great manager . \nDuring this , I have to deal with the new drugs coming to the pharmacy . \nI arrange them in categories , write down their expirey date in the records , put the price lables then puting them in shelves . \nAt 3.00 pm my morning shift ends . \nI leave y mother in the pharmacy and stay at home for three hours . \nAt 6.00 pm the night shift begins . \nDuring this shift nothing important happens . \nI spend some moments watching TV . \nI spend most of the night shift with my father . \nHe was a surgeon , but he had to retire early when he was 29 because of Parkinsonism , a central nervous system disease . \nIn spite of that , he takes part in the management of the pharmacy with my mother and plays successfuly his rule as the leader of the family . \nAlso , he gives medical advice to people gratis . \nIn fact , he is a brave man . \nI hope you have enjoyed these pictures and looking forward for your comments . \nSee you after the weekend . \nWhen the technology lets you down !!!!! Nowadays , we are sorrunded by many forms of advanced technology . \nMany of us have computers , hold a mobile phone or a pocket pc in the trousers pockets , keep flash memory in hand bags , take photos with digital cameras , ... ... etc. . \nThese fancy devices are supposed to make our life easier and that makes us depend on modern technology all the time . \nBut what if I tell you that some of these gadgets can let you down and ruin your life ? \nTher is an old proverb in English , `` The friend in need is the friend in deed '' . \nWell , what my computer and mobile , for example , do is very opposite to a friend action . \nWhen I was student I used to deal with the computer breaking down suddenly and in critical times . \nI had to spend long nights trying to figure out many problems happened without a just reason during finishing urgent works . \nLast month , my younger sister , by the way I have also a brother , was writing her college assignment . \nShe spent 2 days to gather information and 5 long hours typing the report using the Microsoft Word . \nUnfortunately , and before writing the last page , a strange error message appeared and the computer shut down without any warning . \nYes , the work of 5 hours vanished just like that . \nWhat do you expect my sister to do ?!!!! Of course she bursted in tears and had to rewrite the report with the tears on her cheaks because the report had to be handed the next day . . \nYesterday , also , I had to contact the internet service provider to fix a technical problem that cut the internet connection for three days . \nBesides , I ca n't count the number of times my mobile phone turned off during an important call . \nSometimes , I feel that what happened and happens is , somehow , intentional and these devices do these crimes against me with cold blood because they know that I ca n't afford discarding them right now . \nI know that some of you think that this is a stupid illusions , but I wish that I can treat these idiots like humans and give them a piece of my mind !!!!! From flu victim to flu friend ! \nRoger !!!!! : -RRB- Thanks Rachel for your post . \nI am very glad that you like the photos and I hope I could make you any favor you want . \nBy the way , I liked the humming sound you made in the back ground of your fantastic video . \nDo n't be ashamed from something like that . \nIt 's a sighn of you that makes your videos unique . \nFinally , thanks alot for your advices about collocations , but could you , please , give me the model answers of your challenge because it 's hard to find the right answers for these mind binding puzzels !!!!!!!!! For the rest of you , thanks alot for your comments and I hope you have liked the photos . \nHappy birthday to you . \nThe video is fascinating and I watched it many times . \nIt made my day . \nActually , you are very lucky to have birthday presents and a breakfast on bed . \nUnfortunately , all what I got on my birthday is a cup of black Mocca coffee to help me jump out of my bed and start a new day of busy work . \nNowadays , my mother is too busy to make a delicious birthday cake as she used to do many years before . \nLife is unfair , is n't it ?!!!! Do n't be sad . \nMy father bought me a new trousers which I can consider it as a good compensation . \nNow , Rachel , I will give you a virtual birthday present . \nI realized that you have to go to work every day and I do n't you know if you have a weekly dayoff or , as me , not . \nI want to take with you a `` virtual '' picnic in one of the most significant places in Cairo , just to change the rhythm of life and avoid being another Jack . \nIt 's only 10 minuits far from the Citadel . \nWell ... ... it 's not differant from parks in UK , but I hope that the images below will convince you to visit this park when you decide to visit Egypt . \nNow , use your emagination and enjoy these wonderful sceneries . \nI am glad you liked the photos but here are a bunch of nice photos of the sunset from the park . \nI am sure they will give peace to your exhausted souls and end any kind of frustration . \nThanks Rachel for accepting my humble present and I hope I can give you a real one next time . \nMy next entery will be the last before saying goodbye ! \nposted on Thursday , 28 May 2009 | comment on this post Ok guys . \nIt 's time to say my last words . \nThis a very emotional moment and it 's hard to find anything to say . \nFor the blog visitors , thanks alot for your wonderful comments . \nSome of them were funny , some were supportive and some held a lot of sympathy , but , on the end of the day , they made the joy and the benefit of the blog . \nI hope that you liked my few enteries and I am sorry that I did not write many stories about myself , my family , and my country I wanted deeply to write about . \nSincere thanks to the people of BBC learning English who helped me through this great experience by teaching me how to use the blogging area and removing any technical obstacle . \nI know it is just a small part of your work in your fabulous website , but thanks for your care along this month . \nFinally , I ca n't find suitable words to say to you Rachel . \nI am very glad to know somone like you and I am really sad that this is maybe the last chance to write directly to you . \nI will not forget ever your wise advices you gave me and many writing skills you taught me through this short time . \nAn arabic saying tells us , '' The person who taught me a letter deserves my respect and true deeds forever '' . \n`` Thank you '' is not enough for you ! \nI hope I can meet you again through the internet , visit you in the UK , or see you in Egypt to show you hw grateful I am . \nNow , I have to go back to the commenting area and say good luck to our next blogger . \nHere is my very warm or even hot wishes from Egypt , it 's 32 celsius degrees in Cairo today , to you , Taru , in Finland . \nI hope they are warm enough to melt the ice in your country and make you feel warm and able to write . \nTime has come to say thank you Mohammed Jihad for a fantastic blog and some really breathtaking pictures ! \nFrom Monday please welcome our new blog hostess . \nShe is Taru and she is from Finland . \n"}
{"id": "539", "time": "2009-05-01", "text": "Dr Baker is Honorary Secretary of Council to the RCGP Governments around the world are striving to contain a new flu virus suspected of killing more than 100 people in Mexico . \nExperts warn swine flu could spark a global pandemic . \nBBC News online put a number of your questions to flu expert Maureen Baker , Head of Pandemic Planning at the Royal College of General Practitioners . \nIs there a proper definition of how severe a disease is before it can be classed as a pandemic ? \nChris Bonnello , Birmingham Dr Baker : I believe a pandemic is a disease that spreads round the world . \nIn the context of flu , this is when a new strain of influenza virus emerges to which people have no previous resistance , meaning it easily spreads from person to person and from country to country . \nI 'm pregnant and wondered if pregnant ladies will get preference for any vaccination ? \nSarah Murray , Northamptonshire Dr Baker : If a vaccination for swine flu becomes available , this will not happen for several months . \nAs and when that happens , we expect that guidelines will be issued regarding which groups of people should be higher priority for vaccination . \nI have a six-month old baby and we are due to visit a friend who has just returned from Mexico . \nWould you advise staying clear of those individuals who have had recent travel to affected areas ? \nSarah Jones , London Dr Baker : It is difficult to give specific advice as it probably depends how long ago this friend was in Mexico and whether your friend feels well . \nYou should probably weigh these things up and then decide whether to meet your friend just now or not . \nIs swine flu going to be the same as bird flu , i.e. a moral panic , or should we actually be concerned ? \nChris Berry , Wirral Dr Baker : I believe we should be concerned but not get into a panic . \nClearly there is significant potential for this outbreak to develop into a pandemic but , as yet , this is not inevitable . \nAny flu is more serious than a cold as a small number of people can develop complications of flu , such as pneumonia . \nThe other factor that concerns us in respect of pandemic flu is that large numbers of people can fall ill within a short period of time and this has major implications for health services . \nHow long can the virus survive in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed ? \nMatthew Sheldon , Derbyshire Dr Baker : Sorry do n't know . \nI expect this information will become available as we learn more about this particular virus strain . \nMy husband is nearing the end of a chemotherapy course and we would like to go on a cruise but his immune system is low , will travel be a problem ? \nMarion Vanner , USA Dr Baker : I would suggest you keep a close eye on the developing situation over the next few weeks . \nYour husband should consider consulting his physician for advice nearer your intended travel date . \nWill washing your hands kill the virus on your hands and is an antibacterial soap better ? \nTim Smith , London Dr Baker : Washing with soap and water is an effective way of cleaning hands . \nShould people who were asthma sufferers as children be worried by this outbreak ? \nGraeme Pearce , Birmingham Dr Baker : So far , we have no information to suggest that people who have a history of asthma are at any higher risk of complications from this strain of flu . \nMy friend has recently got back from Mexico and has been feeling ill and now I have developed what seems like a normal cold . \nI have had it for about four days and there is no sign of getting better . \nI have n't been to the doctor . \nWhat do you advise ? \nSarah Woollard , Lincolnshire , UK Dr Baker : I think if you have symptoms of a cold - and have had these for four days - then this is almost certainly a normal cold . \nFor more detailed advice -LRB- or if your friend wants further information -RRB- it might help to contact NHS Direct . \nWhat is the incubation time of swine flu from point of exposure ? \nMrs Catherine Edwards , Cardiff , UK Dr Baker : I do n't believe we know enough yet about this illness to be able to say . \nI would expect this sort of information to become available over the next few days . \nIs the basic flu jab sufficient to protect against this virus ? \nJanice Ward , Banbury , UK Dr Baker : No - so far as we know at present . \nWhen flu symptoms arise we are told not to bother the doctor , stay at home , keep warm and drink water . \nGood advice usually but in this case , how do you know when it is necessary to contact the doctor ? \nLesley Buckley , Ely , UK Dr Baker : It is good advice . \nHowever , people will be able to get more information from NHS Direct . \nIf swine flu develops into a pandemic , and reaches the UK , then the public will receive information on leaflets , and from television , that will advise on what to look out for , in terms of worsening symptoms , that should prompt seeking help . \nHow does ` flu ' actually ` kill ' someone ? \nHow long does it take from becoming infected with virus to death , if that is the outcome ? \nGraham Munn , Stevenage , UK Dr Baker : Flu is an unpleasant illness but one that normally leads to complete recovery within a week or so for most people . \nThe danger from flu is mainly from complications , especially pneumonia . \nIf people who have flu become much worse , especially if they start to have breathing difficulties , pneumonia should be suspected . \nIf pneumonia develops , that probably needs to be treated in hospital with antiviral and\\/or antibiotics . \nSome patients with pneumonia can deteriorate very quickly , others may have an illness over a number of days or even weeks . \nThe swine flu is from Mexico but how did it come about and is it going to spread in the UK ? \nSana Mir , Birmingham , UK Dr Baker : Presumably a new strain of flu developed in pigs and then passed to humans -LRB- probably people who work with , or live in close proximity to , pigs -RRB- . \nAt present , we do n't know if it will spread to the UK but the authorities are closely monitoring the situation . \nIs there a risk that if the emerging swine flu H1N1 virus comes into contact with the established bird flu H5N1 virus that the two could mix and cause an even bigger pandemic risk ? \nSarah , Coventry , UK Dr Baker : Any new strain of flu poses a risk of developing into one that can quickly spread and turn into a pandemic . \nEven if these two strains were to meet and lead to evolution of another new virus , I would have thought that would take some time and were it to happen would probably be neither more or less dangerous in itself than any new strain of flu . \nWe have booked a holiday to Cancun Mexico in August we have got young children , should we cancel and go elsewhere ? \nMyroulla Christoforou , London , UK Dr Baker : Hopefully by then the outbreak will have passed , however travel advice is regularly updated on the Foreign Office website . \nLet 's hope you are able to go and have a lovely holiday ! \nWe are a GP surgery with over 8,000 patients . \nWe are obviously awaiting guidance from the Dept of Health . \nIn our pandemic flu plan we have been advised by our local PCT to provide 8 masks a day per member of staff - could you clarify the projected usage of a mask - ie : should they be treated like surgical gloves and disposed of after one use ? \nCaroline Dray , Ramsgate , UK Dr Baker : Masks become ineffective when they become damp or after a few hours . \nThere has been a lot of debate on the use of facemasks and some authorities say that , in the community , the most effective use is to give to patients who may have symptoms when they present in the surgery - that should help reduce the infectivity of that patient to surgery staff and other patients . \nI expect the Department of Health will issue guidance on use of facemasks if we move into a pandemic phase . \nI have no spleen and I 'm concerned that I will find it hard to fight the flu virus if contracted . \nIs there anything I can do to pre-prepare myself ? \nStella Lawrence , Norfolk , UK Dr Baker : You should be very careful in having meticulous hand hygiene , washing your hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol hand rubs . \nShould this become a pandemic strain , some patients -LRB- and people who have had splenectomies may be in this group -RRB- may be directed to take a course of antibiotics if they develop flu symptoms . \nIf this course of action is recommended , then GPs will receive guidance and arrangements will be made for patients for whom such treatment is recommended . \n"}

{"id": "1193", "time": "2009-05-01", "text": "Influenza viruses are able to swap genetic material Preliminary analysis of the swine flu virus suggests it is a fairly mild strain , scientists say . \nIt is believed that a further mutation would be needed in order for the H1N1 virus to cause the mass deaths that have been estimated by some . \nBut at this point , it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how the virus will continue to evolve . \nUK experts at the National Institute for Medical Research outlined on Friday the work they are due to start on samples of the virus sent from the US . \nThe research , being done at the World Influenza Centre in Mill Hill , will be vital for working out the structure of the virus , where it came from , how quickly it is capable of spreading and its potential to cause illness . \nAnalysis done so far suggests what they are dealing with is a mild virus and nowhere near as dangerous as the H5N1 avian flu strain that has caused scientists so much concern over the past decade . \nInfluenza A viruses are classified according to two proteins on the outer surface of the virus - hemagglutinin -LRB- H -RRB- and neuraminidase -LRB- N -RRB- . \nLess severe symptoms , but can be deadly Spreads easily between birds but human transmission rare The swine flu strain is a H1N1 virus , the same type as seasonal flu which circulates throughout the world every year , and kills roughly 0.1 % of those infected or higher in an epidemic year . \nProfessor Wendy Barclay , chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London says initial indications suggest there is nothing about the genetic make-up of the new virus which is a cause for particular concern . \nThe key to its potential lies largely in the H1 protein . \n`` There are two aspects - one is which receptors the virus tends to bind to and what we see is that it is binding to the upper respiratory tract rather than deep in the lungs . '' \nAttaches to receptors in the upper respiratory tract causing mild illness A pandemic is thought to be imminent When a flu virus binds to the upper respiratory tract , it tends to cause mild illness but can be easily spread as people cough and sneeze , Professor Barclay explains . \nIf a virus binds further down in the lungs , it tends to cause much more severe illness , as in the case of the H5N1 avian flu virus which has caused concern in recent years . \n`` With the H1 gene we also look at the cleavage site , '' she adds . \n`` The virus has to be cut into two pieces to be active and it uses an enzyme in the host to do that . \n`` Most influenza viruses are restricted to the respiratory tract because they use enzymes in the lungs . \n`` But some , like H5 viruses can evolve to cut into two pieces outside the lungs , so they can replicate outside the respiratory tract . '' \nThese initial indications are largely guesswork from looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing that to what is known from work on other influenza viruses . \nIt will take weeks and months of biological analysis to properly get a handle on the potential of the H1N1 virus . \nThe team at Mill Hill , one of four World Health Organisation 's centres for influenza research will be working in close collaboration with the Health Protection Agency who are carrying out testing in the UK , and their findings will also feed into the development of a potential vaccine . \nWhat this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains Professor Jonathan Ball , Nottingham University Soon , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge will begin the genetic sequencing of the virus and will also be monitoring any mutations or changes in how virulent it is . \nHowever , there is one other reassuring aspect about what is known so far . \nThat is there seems to be nothing unusual as yet in another protein in the center of the virus , called NS1 , which is linked to the strength of the immune response the virus produces . \nIn some more pathogenic viruses , it is this NS1 protein which initiates a `` cytokine storm '' , a particularly severe immune reaction that can be fatal in even healthy young people . \nScientists have also played down concerns that the milder H1N1 virus , could combine with the more dangerous H5N1 avian flu virus , causing a super virus that has the ability to both spread easily between humans and cause severe illness . \nThis is unlikely - or at least just as unlikely as it ever was and the H5N1 virus has been around for a decade without combining with normal seasonal flu . \nProfessor Jonathan Ball , an expert in molecular virology at the University of Nottingham said : `` The chance of swine H1N1 combining with H5N1 is as likely as any other strain recombining . \n`` What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains . \n`` Many people suspected that H5N1 was the most likely candidate for the next pandemic strain , but now it appears that this was a mistake - but that 's not to say H5N1 or another reassortment containing parts of H5N1 may not happen in the future . \n`` That 's the trouble - you ca n't predict .

{"id": "341", "time": "2009-05-01", "text": "Inside the lab where experts are working on a swine flu vaccine British scientists have begun work on a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus . \nTheir efforts are under way at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control -LRB- NIBSC -RRB- in Hertfordshire . \nThe NIBSC is one of a small group of influenza centres around the world which will create a seed vaccine strain which could then be grown in bulk by manufacturers . \nIts scientists need a steady hand to drill a hole in a hen 's egg . \nFor that is the first step in the creation of a vaccine against the swine flu virus . \nScientists at NIBSC , which is part of the Health Protection Agency , say eggs are ideal for growing up flu viruses . \n`` They are like virus production factories , '' its principal scientist Dr John Wood explained . \nManufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . \nIf they are asked to stop - there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine `` Eggs have been used for decades to make flu vaccines . \nIt 's an old technology but it works very well . '' \nI was allowed into one of the containment labs which will be used to make the vaccine but not where the live virus is being used . \nThis is not because of infection but because I might contaminate the vaccine production process . \nIt involves scientists painstakingly injecting a small amount of virus into each egg which will then be incubated over the weekend . \nBy Monday , they should have enough virus to begin the next stage . \nTwo different techniques are being used . \nFirst , `` reverse genetics '' , where scientists take the H and the N surface proteins from the H1N1 virus and mix them with a laboratory virus known as PR8 . \nThis creates a harmless hybrid virus which can be used for the vaccine . \nThe second technique involves injecting both the H1N1 and PR8 viruses into eggs and allowing the hybrid strain to be created through a natural re-assortment of their genes . \nThe vaccine will work by tricking the immune system into thinking it has been infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus so that it creates antibodies against it . \nThen , if subsequently exposed to the virus , the immune system will destroy the invader before it can cause illness . \nThe first seed strain of H1N1 swine flu vaccine should be ready in three to four weeks . \nIt will then take another four or five months for vaccine manufacturers to produce the vaccine in bulk . \nOn Wednesday , when the WHO raised the threat level to five - one short of a pandemic , its director general stopped short of asking vaccine manufacturers to switch to an H1N1 strain . \nDr Margaret Chan said this was because it was not yet clear how severe the virus would be . \n`` It will be an extremely difficult decision for the World Health Organisation and governments to make , '' said Dr Wood . \n`` Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . \nIt could take manufacturers up to five months to mass-produce the vaccine `` If they are asked to stop doing that it means there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine and vulnerable people could be susceptible if there was an epidemic of ordinary flu this winter '' . \nThe WHO has a matter of weeks in which to make that decision if it does not want to lose valuable time . \nNo-one should expect a swine flu vaccine to be available before the Autumn . \nIn fact most of us will have to wait a lot longer . \nAround 300 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine are produced globally each year . \nThe vaccine includes three different strains of human flu so each dose takes three eggs to produce . \nIf manufacturers switched to producing a single pandemic strain vaccine , they might feasibly triple the number of doses to around 900 million . \nBut it may not be that simple . \nWe do not know how well the virus will grow in eggs or how much antigen will be needed to create an effective vaccine . \nIt may require two injections to provide adequate immunity . \nWith a world population of more than six billion , there clearly will not be enough to go round and the disease will hit poorer countries hardest because they can not afford to buy the vaccines . \nThe UK government has contracts with two manufacturers to produce 120 million doses of pandemic vaccine - enough for two doses per Briton , if required . \nBut unless you are a front-line healthcare worker or someone involved in an essential service , do not be surprised if you are not among the first to receive it . \nIf a pandemic is declared and vaccine production begun then most of us are likely to have to wait until well into next year before we are offered it . \nThat is why it is so important to try to prevent an epidemic in Britain now . \nThat would buy us valuable time in which to create a vaccine . \n"}

'' \nThe commission 's executive director , Bob Martin , told BBC File on 4 the warning was prophetic , coming a year before this outbreak of flu in Mexico in March . \n`` The commission was very concerned regarding the concentration of swine . \nSwine are incredible incubators for viruses - they 're susceptible to swine flu , avian flu and human flu . '' \nHe added : `` They can pass it back to you , the human worker and then back to the pig . \nThey generate the novel virus , as it 's called . '' \nMr Martin said the commission had based its report on research by the Iowa School of Public Health , where one of its commissioners was dean of the school . \n`` They came and addressed what a perfect incubating system a concentrated animal feeding operation or an industrial farm is for breeding novel flu viruses . '' \nHe said the virology experts stated these farms could amplify the spread of flu and add to the problem in another way - by possibly increasing the risk that the virus will also infect humans . \n`` Many of the industrial farm operation workers are lower-income scale in the US - they do n't have access to immediate health care or screening and they would be a bridging population to bring the virus from the industrial farm to the broader population . '' \nHowever the farming industry believes its methods do not increase the risk of breeding novel flu viruses . \nListen to File on 4 , BBC Radio 4 2000 BST , Tuesday 9 June 2009 , repeated 1700 , Sunday 14 June 2009 . \nDr Liz Wagstrom , scientific expert with the US National Pork Council , insisted that a range of precautions are in place on US farms . \n`` There are all sorts of influenza viruses , pigs are one of them , birds are one of them , humans are one of them and there is a chance for these recombination events can happen in all three species so that 's why we have worked very closely with public health agencies to try to develop a surveillance and response plan to identify emerging viruses and respond to them , '' she said . \nThe industry also rejects the term swine flu after meat sales fell following the outbreak of the new flu . \nAnd she said that America 's top public health officials now call the virus H1N1 . \n`` We worked closely with scientists and others to question whether this was an appropriate name and people within the scientific bodies came to the conclusion that even though there were pieces and parts of this virus that were consistent with viruses seen in swine , because it was not number one found in pigs and contact with pigs was not associated with infection , it was better renamed , '' she added . \nHowever , Dr David Morens , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases near Washington DC , is not convinced . \n`` It 's a swine virus - a virus that 's descended from two different pig viruses that have been in pigs for a number of years . '' \nHe told File on 4 : `` If you had asked most virologists last year most would have said it was unlikely that a virus circulating in pigs could jump into humans and cause a pandemic . \n`` And yet that seems what we 're observing now ... it certainly is spreading in the direction of being called a pandemic . '' \nHe added : `` Over the coming months , many public health officials in the world will be discussing these things and undoubtedly more research will need to be done and ask the question what can be done to limit the chance that something like this will happen again . \n"}

'' \nThe resizing is already taking place . \nFrom Singapore Airlines to Qantas , planes have been grounded and carriers are reducing capacity . \nIt will not be business as usual in the post-crisis world The ones in the Asia Pacific stand to lose the most - $ 3.3 bn according to Iata 's projections - so scaling back is imperative . \nHowever , the elusive chief executive of the region 's largest airline , Singapore Airlines , was keeping a brave face . \nChew Choon Seng often eschews one-on-one interviews , but he was happy to talk to us on the sidelines of the meeting 's first cocktail reception about prospects for the future . \n`` Oil prices are still quite high in historical terms . \nThe recession has affected our business globally . \n`` And on top of it , the H1N1 flu epidemic has dampened demand more in Asia , than perhaps in America or Europe , '' he says . \n`` We do not know when the global economy will turn around , but it will in due course , and when it comes around , demand will be there , there will be a revival and the challenge for all of us in the industry is to position ourselves in the interim until we get there . '' \nAirlines are cutting back in other ways . \nFirst-class travel may be on its way out if Alan Joyce , the newly installed chief executive of Qantas Airways is to be believed . \nThe Irishman took the helm of the Australian airline last November , when his predecessor , Geoff Dixon , retired . \nSince he took over , more than 1,000 jobs have been axed , 10 planes have been grounded and the airline has delayed the deliveries of 12 Boeing 737s and four Airbus A380s by up to a year . \n`` What we 've done is said , how do we cope with the current environment where we 've seen 20 to 30 percent drop in premium traffic ? \nOn some routes , we 've seen the first-class cabins particularly empty , '' says Mr Joyce . \n`` So the easiest thing to do in the short term is what we call a cosmetic configuration , which is not selling those seats as first class but selling them as business class , so effectively we have more seats on sale on the aircraft . \nWe have introduced that on a number of routes . '' \nThese worries over the global slowdown , though , did not dictate the entire agenda . \nIata also outlined plans for the industry to become carbon neutral by 2020 . \nAt the meeting , airline bosses committed to a global cap on emissions by 2020 . \nAfter that date , aviation 's emissions will not grow even as demand increases , according to Mr Bisignani . \nAirlines currently account for 2 % of global emissions and that figure continues to grow . \nThe environment is only the last in a long list of concerns that continue to dog the industry , which may , more than most , encounter turbulence while riding out the storm . \n"}

'' \nThe starting conditions DO NOT matter for climate in 100 years time . \nAs for the GCMs - I did not mean to imply that because weather is unpredictable therefore climate is predictable . \nThe problem with your arguments over curve fitting is that the models are NOT tuned to reproduce the 20th century - they are tuned to get the pre-industrial or present day climate as accurately as possible . \nImplying that they keep tuning the models and rerunning them for the 20th century until they get the ` right ' answer is just not true . \nAs for the current decade - what evidence do you have that GCMs do n't project the lack of warming in the current decade ? \nThe average of all the models , by design , will not predict any of the natural fluctuations in the climate - have you examined each individual projection to see whether any have decades when there is no warming , or even a cooling ? \nOthers have , and surprise , surprise , they do project decades when there is a cooling : There are simply periods where the natural variations in the climate system temporarily offset the anthropogenic signals , and the models DO show this . \nAnd , the Met Office have a climate PREDICTION system , which DID predict an offset of anthropogenic warming for the current period : the first link refers to a publication this year . \nOf course they will now say that models predict periods of cooling since they have to deal with that reality . \nMy point is that I can not find any such statements made before 2003 . \nThe second link is actually a prediction , that half of the future years will be warmer than the warmest so far . \nThat is itself is a cop out imo because they have a 50 % chance of being right . \nThe Hadley center I believe have predicted a decade of cooling due to the PDO entering a negative phase , so if I were a betting man , I would say that the Met Office will miss even this prediction . \nClimate models predict a continue storage of heat in the global system . \nNatural variations can not alter this , they can only hide it . \nIn other words a cooling of surface temperatures may occur due to a natual variation that sequesters heat energy . \nThis has to be so because the radiative forcing mandates that more energy is currently entering the system than is leaving . \nHansen himself has written : `` The decadal mean planetary energy imbalance , 0.75 W\\/m2 , includes heat storage in the deeper ocean and energy used to melt ice and warm the air and land . \n0.85 W\\/m2 is the imbalance at the end of the decade . \nSo we would expect to find this heat turn up in the deep oceans . \nHansen wrote this in 2003 I believe . \nAccording to Pielke , heat should be accumulated at the following rate of joules : 2003 ~ 0.98 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2004 ~ 1.96 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2005 ~ 2.94 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2006 ~ 3.92 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2007 ~ 4.90 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2008 ~ 5.88 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules But his observed estimation of accumulation of joules over the period 2003 to 2008 is zero . \nIn other words the predicted sequestration of heat as mandated by the models has not materialised . \nThe models are wrong . \nAt 10:01 am on 12 Jun 2009 , agwbsdotcom wrote : # 27 Jack_Hughes_NZ - yes . \nVery sly , clever foxes at work . \nI agree with your take on the madness of modern crowds also . \n#numbers - you know who you are ; - -RRB- Where are the papers prior to 2003 , or even 2006 that showed the models capable of predicting the current temperature plateau . \n# 28 SheffTim - if there were a link more sympathetic to your view and with a clearer message would you have produced it ?

\nHere is one example of a pre-2003 projection showing both no warming and cooling decades in a projection : Thanks for the link . \nThis does not look to me like a decade long period of non warming . \nWhat this shows is an upward trend from 2000 to 2010 , with a series of higher highs at 2000 , 2005 and 2010 . \nThis suggest that the models were written to reflect the well known at the time ENSO events of a year or 2 , and definately not the longer term cycles such as PDO and AMO . \nLook , we 've had a decade of non warming , and several years of cooling . \nHadley are predicting another decade of cooling . \nThis is nothing like the graph you posted . \nThe point I was trying to make in my last post is that projection of surface temps is a red herring itself , since this is a poor metric for measuring climate change . \nLet 's get to the core issue . \nThe fundamental core of the climate models is that there is an ongoing radiative imbalance . \nHansen has stated -LRB- in 2003 -RRB- that this should reach +0.85 watts\\/sq . \nThis imbalance MUST result in accumulated joules of heat in the climate system . \nAll I was trying to say in my last post was that this should be found in the oceans , but it is n't . \nInitially the argo network reported an apparent cooling anomaly since 2003 but this was later found to be the result of pressure sensor errors . \nThis was corrected and the cooling disappeared . \nThe argo readings now agree with gravimetric and altimetry measurements but still does not show the expected warming , as reported by Willis , Chambers & Nerem -LRB- 2008 -RRB- `` Assessing the globally averaged sea level budget on seasonal to interannual timescales . '' \nThus since 2003 , there has been little if any global warming as diagnosed using ocean heat content . \nSince ocean heat content change has been shown to be a robust metric of global warmng and cooling , then in this sense , the models are not in agreement with empirical data . \nAnd , as I 've already said , the previously predicted ups and downs of a couple of years are nothing like the decadal divergences we are actually witnessing . \nI think you 're missing the point I 'm trying to make about these temperature PROJECTIONS - they 're not trying to predict the evolution of certain decades , they are examples of how the climate might evolve . \nSo ... if you were asking for examples of projections which showed that even on a global scale climate models could show decades where there was a cooling , then I have demonstrated that they do -LRB- e.g. the 2080s in the last link -RRB- , and hence the current decade is not unexpected . \nIf you wanted a PREDICTION of the current decade , then no-one has even tried to do that until the last couple of years , so there are no examples before then . \nAs for the ocean heat content , there is clearly something to understand better there . \nNo more from me on this topic . \nAt 4:41 pm on 21 Jun 2009 , LarryKealey wrote : Jack_NZ , you are close in your distiction between weather and climate . \nWeather is the short term manifestation of the current state of the climate . \nYou are right on in stating that if they ca n't predict the weather 5 months -LRB- or 5 weeks -RRB- from now , they have no hope of making accurate predictions nor projections of any validity for the climate 50 or 100 years hence . \nWhile they are different problems , in theory , making weather predictions is a much simplier problem than predicting -LRB- or projecting -RRB- climate change . \nTo xyz999 , you are quite wrong in your distinction between projections and predictions . \nYou state that the projections do not require accurate initial conditions . \nThe earth 's climate is a very complex Chaotic Dynamic System . \nOne of the key characteristics of Chaotic Dynamic Systems is `` sensitivity to initial conditions '' . \nTweek the initial conditions only slightly and you can see dramatic changes in the output of the system . \nAlso consider that the earth and its climate system is an incredibly complex system . \nThe models used to day have hundreds or even thousands of interrealted variables . \nThe interrelations of these variables are very poorly understood today . \nAdditionally , modellers of today really focus only on CO2 as the primary driver ; hence these models all use a positive feedback with large sensitivity to CO2 . \nThat is to say that small changes in CO2 -LRB- a trace gas -RRB- cause large feedbacks in the atmospheric water cycle - a cycle which is very poorly understood . \nWe may yet find that the feedback associated with CO2 is negative , indicating a very low sensitivity to CO2 . \nWhile today , it may not seem intuitive , increased CO2 could acutally trigger other mechanisms in earth 's climate system which could usher in the next ice age . \nOr , CO2 may not be the `` primary driver '' for climate change at all , and doubling of CO2 could have a negligable effect on temperatures and climate as a whole . \nThe whole point is that we do not know enough today to create models which produce accurate predictions nor projections . \nBasically , they are all meaningless at this point . \nUntil the hard science -LRB- not tweeking models , but real world experimentation and study -RRB- is done , we have no hope of understanding the earth 's climate processes in any meaningful way . \nI applaud the author for presenting the reality of the current situation with climate modelling . \nHe clearly points out that most models are used to explore possible reprecutions of various `` emissions scenariors '' . \nThe implication -LRB- or assumption , if you prefer -RRB- here is that CO2 and GHG emissions will be the primary driver for future climate change . \nIn fact , from what I can read , all the `` doomsday '' models are predicated upon CO2 being the ONLY first order forcing agent for climate change . \nAn assumption which I find highly doubtful . \nWhile keep in mind that proxies are just that - effects of climate impacts on various things - such as tree rings and growth . \nMuch of our understand of past climate is based upon proxies . \nPerhaps one of the best proxies we have today is the Vostok Ice Cores from Antartica . \nNow , before we look at the cores and jump to any conclusions , consider the uncertainties in the source of the data . \nFirst , while atmospheric CO2 is trapped in the ice at the time the ice is formed , it also can move through the core , contaminating the evidence -LRB- CO2 concentrations -RRB- at other -LRB- nearby -RRB- levels within the core . \nOne must also consider that ice is not constantly being formed , during warm periods , we have some melt , re-freezing , even during cold periods , we can have sublimation . \nSo , it is not an exact record . \nIt is just a proxy - but probably one of the best we have available today . \nIn analyzing the ice core , one will find two things that stand out . \nFirst , that CO2 levels generally lag increases in temperatures by about 800 years , rather than preceeding -LRB- i.e. driving -RRB- temperatures . \nThe second thing the stands out -LRB- to me -RRB- is that atmospheric CO2 levels reached their peak , just before each of the last several ice ages . \nCO2 levels -LRB- and temperatures -RRB- were greater during the last interglacial period , 125,000 years ago , than they are today . \nThis did not prevent the rapid onset of the last ice age . \nSimple fact : we just do n't know enough today to make any meaningful predictions nor projections . \nThe author is quite correct in stating we should take all these models with `` a grain of salt '' - perhaps we should take them with a pound of salt ... lol . \nOne of the earliest climate modellers was one of the pioneers of Chaos Theory , a gentleman by the name of Lorenz . \nIn 1961 , while crunching a series of runs of a climate model on a computer , he decided to take a short cut - and start the model in the middle of the time series run . \nHe used values for the initial conditions for the new run from the state of the model during a previous run . \nCopied them exactly from the previous run into the new run and went to get a cup of coffee . \nWhen he returned , he found something completely unexpected - the new run had very quicky diverged from the previous run - and was compelete different - no similarity in output . \nThe reason , quite simply : Sensitivity to initial conditions -LRB- aka , the butterfly effect -RRB- - the numbers he punched in were `` calculated values '' , i.e. rather than exact values -LRB- digital vs analog -RRB- . \nThe changes in initial conditions were extremely small , yet had a dramatic affect on the output . \nPrime example of `` sensitivity to initial conditions '' . \nAn assoiate of his , Dr. Robert White -LRB- who later became director of NOAA -RRB- believed that because of this `` butterfly effect '' , we could control the weather and the climate by taking very small actions -LRB- i.e. a butterfly flapping its wings in china sets in motion a series of events which causes an outbreak of tornadoes in the Midwest US -RRB- . \nA belief that turned out to be quite wrong . \nLorenz saw the falicy of this belief in that , while we could `` tweek '' the conditions only slightly and change the results dramatically , we could not predict the results of the `` tweeking '' . \nAnother characteristic of chaotic dynamic systems is that while they are inheriently unpredictable , they are highly deterministic . \nBasically , take a look at the Lorenz Attractor -LRB- you can google a picture quite easily -RRB- , tweeking the initial conditions and parameters associated with the equation yeilds unpredicitiblity - you ca n't predict the path of the plot on the attractor , yet the plot will still lay with the confines of the `` attractor '' . \nNote that even today , the dynamics of the system -LRB- a model -RRB- used the generate the Lorenz Attractor are still very poorly understood . \nAnd this system had only three equations with three variables . \nClimate models today have thousands of variables - to think we can `` predict '' the results of this system is simply laughable . \nPut simply , we can induce changes in the initial conditions of the system -LRB- i.e. CO2 concentrations and emissions scenarios -RRB- , we can not predict the results of those changes with ANY degree of accuracy . \nThe mechanisms , processes and interractions within the system far from being understood in any meaningful way . \nWe will probably never be able to accurately predict the weather nor the climate changes that will come . \nConsider this - just by measuring a thing , we affect it -LRB- a well known tenat of physics - the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle -RRB- . \nThus , we can never accurately measure the initial conditions of the system to any degree of accuracy , thus , given inherent sesitivity to intial conditions , we have no hope . \nMake all the predictions or projections you want - but they still have no bearing on reality . \nIn today 's world , most every natural disaster is blamed on `` Global Warming '' or `` Climate Change '' . \nIn my lifetime , which unfortunately is almost over , I have seen a dramatic increase in the impacts of severe weather ; however , I do not believe there has been a dramatic increase in the occurance of severe weather . \nTake New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina - often used as a `` poster child '' by the `` Climate Change Gang '' . \nNew Orleans was -LRB- and still is -RRB- a disaster waiting to happen . \nFirst , much of the city is currently 15 ft UNDER SEA LEVEL . \nHello ?? It is protected by a series of levies and dikes . \nThe city was built upon a peat bog . \nAs the bog dried out , it compacted . \nWhat was once 10 ft above sea level is now 15 ft below sea level . \nKatrina was a powerful hurricane , but still only a 3 on the Saphir-Simpson scale . \nThe 1900 storm that hit Galveston -LRB- and killed 6,000 people , living on an island 5 ft above sea level -RRB- , the 1919 Keys storm , Hurricane Allen and Hurricane Carla were all more powerful - as have been many others - but none caused as much damage . \nIn 1969 , I lived in Florida at Patrick AFB , next to Cape Kennedy . \nI watched Apollo 11 lift off for the moon from my back yard . \nAt that time , one could drive down A-1-A along the coast and there were very few buildings and structures in sight . \nPeople did not have the arrogance to believe they could withstand the forces nature would occationally release . \nTake the same drive today -LRB- as I did last fall -RRB- and you will find just about every piece of land near the beach -LRB- low lying land -RRB- has been developed . \nCommon sense tells us that hurricanes will continue to strike the area - and will be `` more destructive '' , but not because the hurricances are more powerful , but because there is more there to be destoryed . \nEven the ancient egyptians were smart enough to not build permanant structures within the flood plain of the Nile river . \nThey knew that floods would be variable and they had no hope of `` controlling '' them . \nIn fact , they prayed for the great floods , because it meant dramatic improvements in soil conditions and the yeild of food from the plain would be significantly greater following the great floods . \nIt astounds me that we here in the US are arrogant enough to believe that we can `` control '' the mighty Mississippi river with dikes and levies , channeling all that water into smaller and smaller channels . \nBuilding in the flood plain is a bad idea - as is building structures on the beach at levels 4-10 ft above sea level . \nOne thing is certain , as long as we continue to battle mother nature in this arrogant fashion , we will lose . \nEvery 20 years or so , there will be a big hurricane or big floods on the Mississippi . \nNothing we can do or build can withstand the power of the rising waters . \nAnd by rising water here , I am referring to floods caused by snow melt in the areas drained by the Mississippi as well as the storm surge and dramatic rainfall caused by hurricanes - not `` rising sea levels '' . \nIn my view , and I have spent my whole life on the water , I see no rise in sea levels . \nI can take you to tide markers on Galveston Bay that have been in place for 50 to 100 years . \nThey are not underwater today - ergo , the sea level has had no significant rise in the last 100 years . \nWhen I hear of the poor plight of the people of the Island Country of Tuvalu , often used another poster child for the `` Climate Change Gang '' , I have to wonder : How stupid do they -LRB- `` The Climate Change Gang '' -RRB- think I am ? \nTuvalu is a small string if islands , mostly atolls . \nThe highest elevation on the islands is about 4.5 M above sea level . \nThey are considered to be on the front line of climate change and supposedly have already felt the impacts of rising sea levels . \nLike all islands in the Pacific Ocean , the islands are subject to a variety of mechanisms which have lead to erosion and sinking of the land . \nPut very simply , it is not rising sea levels that pose the danger to Tuvalu - it is subsidence and erosion - both natural forces at work . \ntake a look at the Hawaiian Islands . \nThe only island that is growing is the -LRB- currently volcanically active -RRB- `` Big Island '' . \nThe Hawaiian islands actually stretch 1600 miles , from the Big Island all the way to Midway . \nMillions of years ago , Midway was `` the Big Island '' , but the volcanism that created the Hawaiian Islands migrated -LRB- with the tectonic plates -RRB- eastward , leaving Midway to succumb to the ravages of erosion -LRB- from both wind , rain and sea -RRB- . \nTo blame the plight of the people of Tuvalu on sea level rise caused by `` climate change '' is downright misleading . \nBecause of erosion , the islands will probably disappear . \nI say `` probably '' because , when the next ice age comes , we can expect sea levels to drop dramatically as great ice sheets form over North America and Europe . \nPerhaps the islands will re-emerge from the ocean for a time . \nNo , because of the nature of Chaotic Dynamic Systems , the inability to make precise measurements and the complexities and interreactions involved in the `` Earth 's Climate System '' - we will never have the ability to make accurate predictions -LRB- nor projections -RRB- . \nLet us focus on spending our money and resources on real environmental issues such as better management of land use , forests , fisheries , pollution control -LRB- no , I am not talking about CO2 - which is not a pollutant , but an essential trace gas required for life as we know it , to exist on earth -RRB- and adaptation . \nWhile I will not delude myself into believing that I can change the -LRB- religious -RRB- beliefs of the `` Climate Change Gang '' , I hope that my words will invoke thought and some modicum of a return to common sense -LRB- not so common anymore -RRB- in the `` common man '' . \nPersonally , I think at best , the `` Climate Change Gang '' are deluding themselves . \nI am astounded by their arrogance to believe that the `` science is settled '' or that the `` skeptics are wrong '' . \nWhen there is no room for skeptics in science , it is no longer science , but religion . \nBefore we spend trillions of dollars -LRB- or pounds -RRB- on a percieved problem -LRB- CO2 emissions -RRB- , should we not develop a better understanding of the climate mechanisms involved ? \nIn my view , it is sheer , unfounded arrogance to believe we can `` control climate change '' and that CO2 is the only first order climate driver . \nWe understand so little and we have so many other pressing environmental and humanistic issues that are much more urgent that we need to spend our money and resources on . \nThe older I get and the more I learn , the more I realize how little I really know and how much more there is to learn ...

'' \nProbably true , unless it hits an obstruction which deflects it uphill , in which case , the energy of the ball -LRB- as determined by its inertia upon striking the obstruction and the energy lost in the impact -RRB- will determine how far uphill the ball will travel ... at which point , it may reach an `` equilibrium point '' and rest upon the ground , have additional energy , bounce and continue uphill , or it may begin to roll back down the hill . \nThere are a lot of factors which will affect the behavior of the ball . \nAnd without a very RIGID set of assumptions , the behavior of the ball is in fact unpredictable . \nOf course , I make the assumption here that by a `` hill '' you mean a real hill , the surface of which is best described as fractal in nature , as opposed to a concrete `` perfect '' hill in which , from any point , there is always an unobstructed path -LRB- path of least resistance -RRB- downwards -LRB- like a `` smooth '' concrete hump - or something you might put in a computer model -RRB- . \nWell , I have seen a few hills in England and Wales , and from my observations , most are much like hills we have in Texas and California ... they are not perfectly smooth domes , if you roll a ball down , it will bounce , its path is unpredictable - it might even travel up-hill . \nAh , but the devil is always in the details , particularly in the real world . \nWe can only really say that a ball launched from a hill will follow the laws of physics and if unobstructed , will exchange potential energy for kinetic energy and accelerate . \nHowever , we can also state that eventually the ball will reach an obstruction and due to friction and exchange of energy through impacts , it will eventually come to rest -LRB- equilibrium -RRB- . \nWe really ca n't say whether that will be at the top of the hill , somewhere on the slopes , or at the bottom , ca n't really say with any certainty . \nDepends upon the structure of the hill , the kinetic energy we impart upon the ball as we launch it , various aspects of the rugby ball -LRB- as well as many other factors -RRB- and every hill is different ... as is every toss , every ball . \nNow , please point out the falicies of my argument regarding the `` ball and the hill '' . \nNow consider that we have just been talking about a very simple problem . \nOne that should easily be modelled . \nYet the best we could really do is to say that `` under certain conditions - i.e. , on THIS HILL , under these wind conditions and humidity -LRB- blah blah blah -RRB- , if we launch THIS BALL with this trajectory and this much force it has a X % chance of following this path and reaching equilibrium at this point '' -LRB- X being a very small number -RRB- . \nNow think about that for a moment , and then consider the Earth 's Climate System - and just how complicated a system we are talking about . \nMost researches would agree with the following statement , regardless of their postion on `` climate change '' : The earth 's climate is a very complex non-linear dynamic system containing a lot of very poorly understood processes and mechanisms . \nSo , if we ca n't solve the dynamics of a simple problem such as rolling a rugby ball down a hill with any degree of certainty , what hope have we of predicting , much less controlling the earth 's climate system ? \n`` IS clearly wrong . \nThe starting conditions DO NOT matter for climate in 100 years time .

'' \n----- End of Gavid Schmidt quote ------------------- It seems to me that he is really saying two imprtant things here - first that we can not `` produce reliable climate predictions for 2050 '' . \nPlease read the first paragraph and if you feel I have mis-interpreted it , please provide you reasoning . \nThe second thing I got from this is the earth 's climate system -LRB- and weather -RRB- are very poorly understood at this point in time . \nI took his words -LRB- mind you these were his words , not those of a commentator or pundit -RRB- to mean that we have barely begun to scratch the surface of all we need to learn and all there is to learn . \nScience will never be settled . \nI also must disagree with your assertion that `` At that kind of timescale -LRB- 20 years -RRB- , you 're not longer looking at the chaotic component , but at the more stable component of the climate which is predictable '' -LRB- @eumenydes -RRB- . \nIt just does n't work that way with chaotic dynamic systems . \nSmall changes in initial conditions of a chaotic dynamic system can produce significant changes in long term output . \nThis is referred to as `` Sensitivied to initial conditions '' . \nIn working with a chaotic dynamic system -LRB- such as a model of earth 's climate -RRB- - you are usually dealing with a set of non-linear equations - in the case of climate models - a vary large set of non-linear equations - requiring supercomputer to `` iterate '' to solutions of all the variables involved for each run . \nIdeally , one wants to `` reduce '' the order -LRB- size or number of equations and variables -RRB- and thus simplify the system -LRB- figure out what is really important -RRB- . \nThis can be achieved by applying the `` Center Manifold Theorem '' . \nThis theorem basicaly states that most dynamic systems are composed of three manifolds -LRB- stable , unstable , chaotic -RRB- and that if one can reduce the equation to the center manifold -LRB- chaotic -RRB- - we can reduce the complexity somewhat - and still preserve the dynamics of the system . \n-LRB- I wrote a package in Mathematics -LRB- R -RRB- as part of my Senior Thesis at the University to do just that - in symbolic form -RRB- . \nIt is the chaotic component of the system which is most important and the reason why we can not make reliable , accurate `` predictions '' of future climate states . \nI do n't wish to come across as being too arrogant here , but it was my field of study and I have made my career in modeling and to a certain extent - chaos theory . \nIf not for the chaotic component , we would be able to really model the climate and make meaningful predictions . \nHis point was that because of the chaotic nature , we will never be able to make meaningful `` predictions '' nor even projections . \nThat is why I am a skeptic of the science . \nI am also very skeptical of the the suggested policies and programs currently being investigated -LRB- only one really : cap and trade -RRB- . \nThere are other solutions . \nThere are other answers . \nWe have much left to learn , but why create a whole economy around `` carbon trading '' when we are pretty sure it ai n't gonna work ? \nThere are other approaches - even if you are not skeptical of the AGW\\/CACC theories out there today . \nWhy not focus on developing the third world with cheap energy - which will make it feasable for them to preserve and restore natural environments -LRB- like rainforsts and peat bogs . . -RRB- \nas well as reduce suffering and strife ? \nI am a skeptic , but so what - even if CO2 is the `` great evil '' - I have yet to see a real plan to `` solve '' the problem . \nCap and Trade is not going to do it - its just going to make those whe area already really rich , even richer and the rest of us even poorer . \nOk - I 'll get off my soapbox - sorry that was so long . \nI would also add that Gavin Schmidt discusses output from two models : one says the southestern US will be dryer with a rise in temperature - while another - fed the same data - projects that it will be wetter - they both ca n't be right . \nAt 11:13 am on 28 Jul 2009 , eumenydes wrote : Hi Larry - I 'll do my best to respond point by point , hopefully the various interspersed quotes wo n't make it too jumbled ! -RRB- \nIt seems to me that he is really saying two imprtant things here - -RRB- first that we can not `` produce reliable climate predictions for 2050 '' . -RRB- \nPlease read the first paragraph and if you feel I have mis - -RRB- interpreted it , please provide you reasoning . \nIn the first paragraph you provided he is n't talking about climate models not being valid , he 's talking about the existing engineering models -LRB- used for building infrastructure -RRB- which are based on historical climatology , which will no longer be valid in 10 , 20 , 30 years time because of climate change . \nHere is the full context : `` Everywhere you go you see societies based around certain expectations for what their climate is . \nHow far do you build away from the shore ? \nHow do you design your agriculture ? \nWhat kind of air conditioning system do you put in a building ? \nAll of these things depend on the expectations you have for what temperature it is going to be during the summer time or how high a storm surge reaches when you have a Northeasterly storm . \nAll of these things require an expectation that has been built over hundreds of years but that now is changing . \nWhen you have expectations based on past information that are n't any longer going to be valid expectations or you have a suspicion that they are no longer going to be valid , how do you come up with new expectations ? \nHow do you inform decisions that are being made now that will affect how people react to climate in 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 years time ? '' \nHe then goes on to explain how we have constructed climate models in order to answer that question . \nIn the second paragraph you quoted , the questions he is asking are rhetorical ones - he 's not saying we do n't understand why there are seasonal cycles or why are there storms , he giving examples of the kind of questions that any climate model has to know the answer to if it 's going to provide a valid simulation of the climate system . \nIf we really did n't know why there are seasonal cycles , then you 're quite right we would just be scratching the surface of climate science and would n't really have a clue how the climate works ! \nFortunately we do understand most of these things , which is what Gavin Schmidt was saying - he was just listing the kinds of issues we have to build in to the models , as he goes on to say later : `` We have been quite successful at building these models on the basis of small-scale processes to produce large-scale simulation of the emerging properties of the climate system . \nWe understand why we have a seasonal cycle ; we understand why we have storms in the mid-latitudes ; we understand what controls the ebb and flow of the seasonal sea ice distribution in the Arctic . \nWe have good estimates in this regard . '' -RRB- \nScience will never be settled . \nI quite agree - in many areas of science every question you answer throws up two more . \nBut that does n't mean we never know anything ! \nAs it stands , theoretical physicists ca n't reconcile Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity with the Standard Model of particle physics -LRB- ie they ca n't reconcile gravity with the other three fundamental forces -RRB- . \nI fully expect that in the future we will have a theoretically self-consistent theory of quantum gravity , but until then it 's a mystery . \nThat does n't mean gravity does n't exist , or that it 's not caused by an object 's mass , or that we 're actually being held on to the Earth 's surface by invisible fairies . \nThe fact that we do n't know absolutely everything about gravity does n't mean we know nothing about it . \nLikewise you 're absolutely right to point out that on smaller regional scales climate models sometimes give contradictory predictions for things like rainfall . \nThere is very high confidence in model predictions of global mean temperature , high confidence in their predictions of regional temperature changes , and reasonable high confidence in larger scale precipitation predictions - eg on zonal average or continental scales - but no , we ca n't say for sure what 's going to happen to rainfall in the American Southwest . \nAfter more work has been done on this question -LRB- and many others ! -RRB- \nand more improvements made to the models , I 'm sure we will be able to answer that - but we 're not quite there yet . \nThat does n't mean the models ' other predictions are worthless . \nHmm , this post is getting a bit long , sorry ! \nI 'll reply to your points about chaotic systems in a new post ...

'' \nIn other words , we ca n't predict climate from year to year or even from decade to decade because the chaotic component is too strong . \nOn periods of 20 years or longer the chaotic noise is canceled out and we can look at the predictable component . \nThat 's exactly what climate models are designed for , and exactly what climate predictions do . \nThat 's not to say there are n't many uncertainties , but the climate is most definitely not inherently unpredictable on these timescales . \nFor a better explanation than my -LRB- probably rather botched ! -RRB- \nCap and -RRB- Trade is not going to do it - its just going to make those whe -RRB- area already really rich , even richer and the rest of us even poorer . \nFirstly , I have never heard any scientist say that CO2 is a `` great evil '' or even any kind of evil . \nCO2 = bad is a straw man argument that various cranks -LRB- such as in that Ch 4 `` swindle '' program -RRB- have come up with to try and discredit climate scientists . \nI 'm sure you did n't mean it that way so I 'm sorry to harp on about a throw-away comment , but I 've heard this so many times that it 's starting to bug me , lol ; - -RRB- CO2 is a necessary gas for the continuation of almost all existing ecosystems . \nIt 's just that too much of it in the lower atmosphere causes an increase in global temperature and other effects . \nLikewise water is vital for life on Earth - that does n't change the fact that if you get too much in your lungs you 'll drown . \nA pollutant is n't an evil , it 's just too much of something in the wrong place . \nAs to the policy aspect - I 'm not going to try and discuss policy or cap and trade as I do n't know enough about it to offer an informed opinion I 'm afraid . \nI too have reservations about its effectiveness and you may well be right that it wo n't help reduce CO2 emissions . \nHowever what I would say is that the scientific questions and the policy ones are completely separate and I wish people would keep them that way . \nScientists answer the questions `` what is happening , and what will happen if we continue emitting CO2 ? '' . \nPoliticians et al answer the question `` what shall we do about it ? '' . \nI would use the analogy of a medical diagnosis : A patient comes in who is overweight , drinks too much and smokes regularly , has high blood pressure and cholesterol and never does any exercise . \nThe doctor will likely tell him that unless he changes his lifestyle he will almost certainly end up with heart disease , liver damage , increasingly immobile , with trouble breathing and at vastly increased risk of premature death from cancer or a heart attack . \n-LRB- And of course , each of those predictions has a different level of confidence attached ! -RRB- \nBut whether or not he does change his lifestyle is up to him - he may decide that he likes his bacon , beer and cigarettes so much that he can live with the increased risk of cancer and if he has to have expensive and painful surgery for liver failure , clogged arteries or heart failure then that 's a price he 's willing to pay . \nHe may even make a legitimate value judgment that the pain he will have to undergo in trying to lose weight and give up smoking and alcohol will outweigh the pain of the resultant health problems . \nThat 's his decision and he may even be right . \nAnd even if he does decide to deal with the problem now rather than await the consequences , he still needs to decide how best to tackle it . \nShould he ditch the beer first , or concentrate on trying to quit smoking ? \nShould he go on a strict diet , or just do more exercise ? \nAll are legitimate questions , and it 's up to the patient to decide on the best answers . \nBut what he should n't do is say `` Eh , what does the doctor know - he 's just pretending things are wrong with me in order to make more money . \nAnd anyway , I 'm not overweight I just have heavy bones . '' \nWell , ok - I 'm sure many people do say exactly that , and I can even see the appeal of that kind of delusion -LRB- which I 'm sure is why `` classic denial '' is one of psychiatry 's stock phrases -RRB- but that does n't mean it 's accurate or sensible ! \nHeh - I promise I 'll shut up now ...

'' \nNeither students nor club owners appear overly worried about the virus . \nSo just how concerned should they be ? \nWell , according to a recent statement from Dr Margaret Chan , Director General of the World Health Organization : `` With the exception of the outbreak in Mexico , which is still not fully understood , the H1N1 virus tends to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people . \nOutside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness , and all deaths , have been detected in people with underlying chronic conditions .

\nAt one point Spain had more cases than we did and yet now we have several times more cases than they do and many times more cases than the rest of Europe , who by the BBC 's figures , have less than 100 cases each . \nI share the concerns of slpslp who commented this morning , regarding whether the UK government has the backbone to take more drastic measures such as closing things down to slow the spread ? \nUnfortunately I have my doubts that they do . \nWhilst some may critisize countries like Mexico for not being as advanced as others , at least they had the courage to close areas down to try to gain control . \nThe same can be said for air travel - a lot of the new cases I am reading about come about after travel to America - can we imagine the government or airlines stopping flights out there ? \nI hope they would be brave enough . \nI think some responsibility also rests with the UK public - I for one would not be traveling to badly affected areas and yet people selfishly still are . \nWhat is more important - people 's lives or a holiday ?

{"id": "75", "time": "2009-06-01", "text": "Fergus Walsh | 14:07 PM , Monday , 1 June 2009 One of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in the autumn . \nProfessor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . \nAnother fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . \nOne of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . \nBut Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . \nThat does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . '' \nHowever , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes . \n`` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said . \n`` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it . \n`` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . '' \nProfessor Oxford said that in the next few months , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa . \nThe southern hemisphere is entering its winter and the peak period for flu . \nOn Friday , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa . \nWhat happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming months will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America later this year . \nThere would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness . \nThankfully , there are no signs of that yet . \nThe Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there . \nThe Science Media Centre in London has lots of reliable specialist comments on flu and a host of other issues . \nAt 6:19 pm on 01 Jun 2009 , drmattprescott wrote : I wish the BBC would check the facts before telling everyone they were going to die from swine flu or , after almost nothing happens for two weeks , tell us that we are all going to die in the autumn . \nIf a million people had died in Mexico we would have something to worry about , but as it is this flu seems no worse than normal flu , even though it has an unusual origin . \nUnusual does not equate to dangerous and I wish that the relative risks had been far better explored before the Beeb had decided to follow the herd and jump off the deep end . \nThousands of people die of flu every year , whilst millions die of diahorrhea so perhaps you could instead whip up some hysteria where it is 100 % justified and could genuinely help to reduce the number of preventable deaths in the world . \nAt 7:40 pm on 01 Jun 2009 , lawyer_jake wrote : I have not been to Mexico . \nI know nobody who has - as far as I am aware . \nI have developed a throat problem over this past weekend -LRB- 30\\/31 May 2009 -RRB- . \nI am losing my voice - coupled with sneezing and running nose but no fever temperatures . \nI am still going to work . \nI have an appetite . \nI do not think it is flu - I have had it - in Royal Air Force many years ago - temperature of 102 etc. . \nShould I get it checked out ?

\nAfter all agency workers help out when there is no-one else available , and without them , some key work areas could find themselves seriously compromised . \nVery mild symptoms which would have been missed if I had n't found out by chance that she 'd had contact with a confirmed case at school . \nThat was last Thursday . \nSo far neither my husband nor I have any symptoms and our daughter has fully recovered . \nShe was given Tamiflu to hasten recovery , but we would prefer not to take it ourselves as we do n't have any symptoms and want to build up our own immunity in case this flu returns in a nastier form . \nOur family has been quarantined , but the ` contain ' policy is being reviewed as more schools are closing and more cases confirmed . \nVictoria -LRB- where we live -RRB- has the majority of cases in Australia - almost 400 here alone . \nMy suggestion is to be cautious and let common sense prevail . \nThere is a lot you can do to prevent the spread of flu , but it 's proven to be more of an inconvenience than a threat so far . \nThanks to drmattprescott for your comments . \nHave a good look in the blog and on the BBC coverage and I 'm confident that you wo n't find any hysterical claims from correspondents about swine flu . \nIf you watched the Six or Ten o'clock news on BBC1 on Friday you would have seen me do a report about the threat of drug-resistant malaria . \nI have also reported several times on HIV\\/AIDS , TB and child mortality - from a variety of causes - including diarrhoea . \nYou are quite right to say that thousands of people die from flu every year - the WHO global estimate is 250,000-500 ,000 . \nI have pointed this out several times . \nDeath estimates for flu are not simple but it 's thought that between one and two million people died in each of the last two pandemics , many times more than with seasonal flu . \nClearly that is not as many as die from malaria , TB and HIV\\/AIDS , but a pandemic , even of largely mild illness , would have a huge impact both in the UK and internationally . \nIn Britain , hundreds of thousands of people might be off work during the peak periods of infection and that would have a major economic and social impact - far more than with seasonal flu . \nI ca n't give personal health guidance on this blog - not least because I 'm not medically qualified . \nIf you are ill you should probably seek medical advice of some kind , via NHS Direct , or NHS 24 in Scotland . \nIt 's generally not a good idea for people with coughs , colds or flu to take the virus down to their GP surgery . \nHope you feel better soon . \nThanks for your comments Ikarus . \nAn earlier post `` Explaining flu '' gives you the predictions about mortality in the UK in a pandemic . \nLike all drugs , Tamiflu has potential side-effects , nausea being a common complaint . \nRE Comment 5 : Let me clear up any confusion about what Professor Oxford 's comments . \nHe is advising that healthy people should carry on life as normal , in the event of a pandemic , although they should follow sensible hygiene guidance . \nBut sick people should stay at home and keep the flu virus to themselves . \nRE Comments 6 and 7 . \nIt 's interesting that the CDC and WHO stopped calling it swine flu sme time ago . \nThe CDC goes for `` novel influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' and the WHO `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection '' . \nBoth are a bit of a mouthful for when I 'm reportng on TV or radio . \nI tend to call it H1N1 swine flu when I mention it first and then shorten that to swine flu or H1N1 virus afterwards . \nRE Comment 9 , thanks very much for getting in touch . \nIt 's very good to know what is happening on the ground in Australia and to hear that your daughter is ok . \nPlease let me know how she gets on with the Tamiflu and whether she suffers any of the reported side-effects such as nausea -LRB- which seem to be very mild -RRB- . \nI 'd be interested to get some first-hand accounts of the disease and the treatment . \nAt 8:47 pm on 02 Jun 2009 , MajorGallagher wrote : Ikarus wrote : `` One would expect to experience a bereavement in the next year '' , which , based on the current evidence is surely grossly over-stating the dangers , even assuming a figure at the higher end of the projected figures -LRB- that is a 1 % fatality -RRB- . \nYou say `` no reason to panic '' but in the next breath seem to be saying `` people can expect one of their loved ones to die within the next year from swine flu '' ! \nThanks for your comments MajorGallagher . \nPlease point out to me where I suggest that someone close to you is going to die from swine flu in the next year ?

Influenza virus susceptibility and resistance to oseltamivir . \nAntivir Ther 2007 ; 12:603 -616 The sun has been shining , the temperature rising , and it really does feels like summer . \nSo it 's not the traditional time one would expect a flu virus to flourish . \nUV light cooks the viral goose pretty quickly , and people are outside more , rather than being huddled together swapping germs -LRB- let 's not spoil this theory by mentioning air conditioning or public transport -RRB- . \nBut the H1N1 swine flu virus is not like seasonal flu . \nIt 's sufficiently novel and contagious that it is continuing to spread despite the warmer weather . \nLet 's look at what 's happening in the UK and USA . \nThe number of cases of swine flu in the UK has doubled in a week . \nLaboratory confirmed cases stand at 4,322 . \nEngland saw its biggest daily increase today with 535 new cases , most of them coming because of a surge in London and the west Midlands . \nBoth areas now have more cases than the whole of Scotland , where the virus continues to flourish in the Glasgow area . \nWith the virus now very firmly established in London , it 's likely that further big increases will follow . \nAnd remember that many cases are going unreported . \nDoes that mean a peak in cases - a full-blown national epidemic - will come earlier than expected , perhaps in late August or September ? \nPossibly , but the expectation is that once the school holidays begin , there could be a pause with a peak coming from autumn onwards . \nThen we could see tens of thousands of cases a week and every part of the UK will be affected . \nAt present , in Wales , north-east and north-west England , there 's still hardly any flu at all , so the virus is still not fully embedded here . \nNow to the United States . \nThe CDC in Atlanta has given another of its very helpful briefings to journalists . \nDr Anne Schuchat set out the situation there : 27,717 laboratory-defined cases with more than 3000 hospitalisations and 127 fatalities . \n`` This virus is not going away , '' she said , `` and the reported cases are the tip of the iceberg . \nWe are estimating there have been at least one million cases in the United States - not perfectly accurate but a ball-park figure . '' \nThat estimate is based on some telephone polls asking people whether they 'd had flu-like symptoms in the past three weeks -LRB- not the most accurate way of estimating illness -RRB- and some community surveys which suggested 6 % of people in hot-spot regions may have had the virus . \nWhile not terribly accurate , the CDC appears confident that at least one million Americans have been infected . \nIf so , that is very reassuring news because it means the fatality rate is really very low . \nNorth America is about a month or so ahead of the UK with its outbreak so what happens there is a good guide to what may happen here . \nSo who is getting H1N1 swine flu in the US ? \nDr Schuchat said the virus was affecting mainly younger people rather than the elderly and made these points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- nearly 80 % of those hospitalised have been under 50 ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- average age for hospitalisation is 19 ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- average age for those who 've died is higher , at 37 ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- about 75 % of those who have died have had underlying health conditions ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- there have been very few cases in people over 65 , so they are very unlikely to be infected - but when they do get it , elderly people have a higher risk of complications and death . \nSo how mild is mild and what sort of symptoms do people have ? \nDr Schuchat said that most had a fever and respiratory symptoms , a cough , a cold , with some having diarrhoea . \nPeople may be miserable in bed for a few days , but the illness clears up on its own . \nThe US , unlike the UK , has restricted antivirals to those at most risk of complications , so comparatively few doses of Tamiflu have been handed out . \nThe CDC ca n't say yet how many people are asymptomatic - that is , the number of people that have such mild illness they do n't even realize they 've had swine flu - but with a million plus Americans thought to have had swine flu , it must be a pretty sizeable number . \nA minority can have a much tougher time , according to Dr Schuchat : `` It 's important for everyone to be aware of the virus , and especially for those with underlying health conditions , asthma , diabetes , chronic lung disease , and pregnant women : these people need to be especially concerned if they develop a fever and respiratory illness . '' \nSome mention has been made of obesity being a risk factor . \nDr Schuhat said that those who were obese , and especially the morbidly obese -LRB- those with a Body Mass Index , or BMI , above 40 -RRB- often have chronic lung disease , and that 's why they were at risk of complications . \nBeing obese on its own does not seem to be a risk factor . \nTo sum up : swine flu is here to stay . \nFor the vast majority it is nothing to worry about . \nFor a small minority , it can cause serious illness . \nIt should neither be dismissed out of hand nor should it be a reason for panic . \nScientists must continue to monitor the virus to see whether it mutates or becomes more virulent or becomes resistant to antivirals ; thankfully , there 's no sign of those at present . \nA briefing by the chief medical officer for England Sir Liam Donaldson and the new Health Secretary Andy Burnham yielded some interesting new thinking on H1N1 swine flu . \nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . \nVisit BBC Webwise for full instructions . \nIf you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . \nLet 's start with antivirals . \nAt present , everyone in the UK who is suspected of having H1N1 swine flu is offered them . \nBut the virus is proving so mild that it has got health officials wondering whether this really is a sensible policy . \nThe Department of Health , like global health bodies , was expecting the next pandemic to be a more aggressive virus with a higher mortality rate . \nThere are plenty of antivirals to go round - enough Tamiflu -LRB- and the lesser-known Relenza -RRB- for half the population , and eventually for eight in ten people in the UK . \nSir Liam Donaldson said that he 'd asked scientists to look into the issue . \n`` People with seasonal flu do n't get antivirals , '' he said . \n`` Should we be treating only those who are at higher risk of complications ? '' \nIt would represent a big shift in policy on Tamiflu . \nAlready , some of those offered the drug are turning it down because they do n't see the point in taking it when they have only mild symptoms or are simply a close contact of someone infected , or because they want to avoid possible side-effects like nausea . \nBut before people say that the whole pandemic issue has been a lot of fuss over very little , a word of caution . \nSir Liam pointed out that they were working on the basis of three potential scenarios for this autumn and winter : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the virus is largely unchanged and remains mild ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it changes and becomes more severe -LRB- bear in mind that all flu viruses mutate , which is why we need a new seasonal flu vaccine each winter -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- and the least likely option , says Donaldson -RRB- it combines with another virus subtype and a new strain emerges . \nIf -LRB- 2 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- occurs , then the pandemic would become more serious . \nAnother topic that came up was vaccines . \nSir Liam said the government hoped to get the first doses of H1N1 vaccine in August . \nBy the end of the year , we were told , there might be 60 million doses , enough for about half the population , based on the assumption that each person would need two jabs . \nSir Liam said there was a `` cookery book element '' to vaccine production , which I took to mean that the yield and dosing strategy varied from year to year . \nAs a result , we ca n't yet be sure when we will get all the vaccine . \nAnother issue , not discussed , is that the UK is just one of many countries which has contracts for vaccine , and there will be pressure from all governments to get their doses first . \nAnother issue that the government must grapple with is who to vaccinate first . \nSir Liam said that they had to strike a balance between protecting people at higher risk and targeting the vacine to slow the spread of the virus . \nThe latter could be done by vaccinating everyone in outbreak areas . \nBut Sir Liam indicated it was more likely that at-risk groups would be protected first . \nNothing was said about front-line health workers , but I would expect this group to be among the first to be immunised . \nAndy Burnham said that , as with all such issues , they would be `` led by the science '' . \nMr Burnham pointed out that the vaccine contracts would eventually supply 130 million doses . \nBut officials ca n't yet say when all the jabs will arrive . \nIt 's quite possible that millions of Britons will encounter the virus before they are offered a vaccine - it all depends on what happens this autumn . \nBut Sir Liam pointed out that the vaccine will be useful even after this autumn : `` In all previous pandemics , excess mortality has occured for three years after the virus appeared '' . \nFinally , how do you know what will happen if you , your child or a friend feels ill with suspected swine flu ? \nThe answer is : it depends entirely on where you live . \nIn parts of London , the west Midlands and east Berkshire -LRB- all swine flu `` hot spots '' -RRB- , there is a shift away from containment towards `` outbreak management '' because there are so many cases in the community . \nI will set out the three phases involved in managing the outbreak in the UK : Containment phase : this is still be used in many areas where there are few cases . \nContacts of infected people are traced and offered antivirals , schools may be closed and all those suspected of infection are tested via nasal and throat swabs , to produce a laboratory diagnosis . \nIn this phase , it is the Health Protection Agency that takes the lead . \nOutbreak management phase : this is the policy in hotspots . \nOnly a small proportion of suspected cases will be swabbed -LRB- so that the HPA can keep tabs on the spread of the disease -RRB- and instead , GPs will do clinical diagnosis . \nSchools are unlikely to close . \nContacts are not traced and Tamiflu might be restricted only to those with suspected infection . \nAreas will change to this policy once the virus is spreading widely in their community . \nEach area might adapt the policy to suit their local circumstances - `` flexibility '' is the buzzword . \nTreatment phase : this will be a UK-wide policy , according to Sir Liam . \nHe suggested it would be triggered when there were `` west Midlands-style outbreaks in five parts of the country '' . \nThe NHS takes the lead instead of the HPA and it 's treated a bit like a large outbreak of seasonal flu . \nBut the aim would be to take pressure off GPs and to encourage people to use a telephone line to report symptoms . \nThose who are thought to have the virus will get a unique number which will allow a `` flu friend '' to collect antivirals from a collection point - which may not be a traditional pharmacy . \nThe HPA willl keep tabs on the virus and check if it is changing or developing resistance to antivirals . \nThe huge increase in cases of H1N1 swine flu in the west Midlands has led to a sudden rush of the `` worried well '' to casualty . \nThe Heart of England NHS Trust , which runs three big hospitals , says it has had to set up sectioned-off areas in casualty to deal with people who fear they have the H1N1 virus . \nAt Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham , up to 100 extra people a day are turning up at casualty , which is something like a 25 % increase as compared to usual . \nThe hospital is having to tie up medical staff to assess the influx of supposed swine flu cases . \nAnyone who does not have a fever - a temperature of over 38 degrees - plus two other symptoms -LRB- such as cough , headache or diarrhoea -RRB- is being sent home . \nMany simply have a cough , a cold , or are feeling a bit `` under the weather '' . \nFor a minority with obvious symptoms of the virus , the staff performs swab tests , and then sends those patients home as well . \nDr Tony Bleetman , a consultant in the emergency department , says that if you do have the virus , you should n't be going to hospital , where you may spread the disease : `` Even if they have swine flu , it 's mostly behaving like the common cold and we would n't expect people to come to hospital with that . '' \nIf you have concerns , the advice is to contact NHS Direct . \nBut Dr Bleetman says that many of those turning up have done that : `` The problem is that significant numbers are being sent to us after consultation with NHS Direct and we think that NHS Direct are too quick to send people to hospital . '' \nThe problem began last week as the number of cases in the west Midlands began to soar . \nThe Trust has appealed to `` swine flu locals '' -LRB- as they phrase it -RRB- to stay away . \nI 've mentioned the problem of the worried-well before . \nIt is a real concern of the WHO that the anxious should not clog up hospital emergency rooms during a pandemic . \nImagine if what 's happening in the west Midlands gets repeated at hospitals across the UK as the virus spreads . \nWhat 's interesting is that the worried well have not been a problem in Scotland , where there was a peak in swine flu cases a few weeks ago . \nThe Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS which covers a region of two dozen hospitals , told me that they had not noticed any sudden influx at casualty . \nBear in mind that Scotland has had the only death from swine flu . \nMaybe the public health messages have been more effective there . \nOr perhaps there are simply more `` worried well '' -LRB- or , as harsher observers term them , hypochondriacs -RRB- south of the border . \nA sharp increase in the global number of cases and deaths can been seen in the latest figures from the World Health Organisation . \nThe total now stands at 52,160 laboratory-confirmed cases including 231 deaths in around 100 countries and territories . \nBeware any attempt to derive a `` death rate '' from such figures -LRB- which , by my reckoning , would come out as four deaths in every 1,000 people infected -RRB- . \nAs has been repeatedly pointed out , the vast majority of cases go unrecorded , so the figure of 52,160 is a huge underestimate of the actual numbers . \nWork is clearly needed to get a more accurate figure for the mortality and morbidity -LRB- ill-health -RRB- associated with the virus . \nEngland has also seen a series of big daily increases in lab-confirmed cases in recent days . \nThere were 204 new cases confirmed by lab tests today ; the total number in England has doubled in just five days , with the West Midlands accounting for half of all infections . \nThe vast majority of those infected have experienced mild flu-like symptoms and fully recovered . \nThere have been no deaths in England and one in Scotland . \nThe graphs below will show you the figures for the six countries worldwide with the biggest case-loads , in descending order : United States , Mexico , Canada , Chile , UK , Australia . \nThe CDC in Atlanta has held another useful briefing on the progress of H1N1 swine flu in the United States . \nSince the US is the global center of the outbreak with far more cases than anywhere else , though fewer deaths than in Mexico , we can learn from that experience about how the virus is behaving now and what may happen in the coming months . \nDr Daniel Jernigan , Deputy Director of the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made these comments : `` The U.S. will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer , and at this point we 're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter . \nThe amount of activity we expect to be low , and then pick up later . \nIn terms of the numbers of infections that have been laboratory confirmed as H1N1 , there are now more than 17,800 of those in the United States , including around 1,600 that have been hospitalized and 44 that have died . \nAs we have been saying all along , these numbers are likely an underestimate of the number of cases that are out there . \nThere are some surveys that indicate that the amount of disease in the areas that are having activity with H1N1 is perhaps around 7 % of the population reporting symptoms due to influenza-like illness . \nThe virus continues to impact mostly younger people . \nSo far it is not causing significant illness and death in the elderly like we would see with seasonal influenza . \nAnd the symptoms that are being reported are consistent with influenza , that being predominantly fever , cough , some shortness of breath , fatigue and chills . \nThere is some vomiting and diarrhea that have been associated with cases of this infection . \nEveryone needs to be alert to the symptoms of the illness , and especially if you have underlying conditions , such as asthma , diabetes and heart disease . '' \nFor me , the 7 % figure jumps out . \nThat would mean many millions of cases in the US already , and would be good news because it would mean that the risk of serious illness or death -LRB- already small -RRB- was even lower . \nEarlier CDC estimates reckoned that 19 out of 20 cases were going undetected . \nJon Cohen from Science Magazine put this question : `` Jon Cohen : Dr. Jernigan , you said there might be as many as 100,000 Americans infected . \nWith the finding that 7 % had influenza-like illness in affected communities , that extrapolates to 20 million Americans . \nCould you give an estimate that 's more up to date than the 100,000 ? \n`` Dan Jernigan : `` Well , the 100,000 , as you know , is a rough generalization to try to give a sense of the magnitude of infections that might be there relative to the numbers of laboratory confirmed that we actually had . \nAnd so as you can see , in some areas , where there have been a lot of transmissions , like New York City , they 're finding maybe around 7 % of the community was infected , or had influenza-like illness . \nThere 's some other parts of the U.S. where some of our preliminary data suggests the same thing . \nI think it would be inaccurate to try and take an attack rate of 7 % or an area that 's highly affected and apply that to the U.S. population . \nBecause as we all know , the amount of disease is different in different parts of the U.S. And so clearly there are hundreds of thousands of cases that have occurred in the U.S. . \nWe are working to get a very good estimate of that . \nBut at this point , it would be incorrect to take that percent and apply it to the U.S. '' So the CDC clearly does n't yet have a clear idea of the true number of cases in the US beyond saying that there have clearly been hundreds of thousands . \nOne final quote from Dr Jernigan on those who are most at risk of complications responding to a question from Emma Hitt at MedScape : `` Dan Jernigan : Your question is , what numbers of individuals that are hospitalized have underlying diseases , and about 70 % have some kind of underlying disease . \nThe most predominant of that is asthma . \nThe second being diabetes . \nImmunocompromised status , either through cancer chemotherapy or other compromising conditions is about 13 % . \nAnd chronic underlying heart disease . \nThe things that we see normally as underlying diseases that are associated with increased influenza risk are the same that we 're seeing with H1N1 . '' \nCases seem to be declining in New York , one of the worst affected areas . \nFor those interested in the impact on health and hospitalisations in the city , there is more detail available from the NYC Department of Health . \nA further sign of the spread of H1N1 swine flu in the UK has come with news that many patients in Birmingham who exhibit symptoms will no longer have laboratory tests to confirm the disease . \nInstead , doctors will rely on clinical diagnosis -LRB- in other words , a simple physical examination -RRB- . \nThe west Midlands has just over half of all the confirmed cases of swine flu in England . \nFurthermore , in the areas of significant community spread in Birmingham , antivirals will be restricted to high risk and immediate contacts and household members , rather than everyone that an infected person may have been in contact with . \nThis is exactly what was announced last week in Scotland regarding the outbreaks in Glasgow and Paisley . \nIt 's entirely unsurprising , and a common-sense response once there are significant levels of transmission . \nOne hundred and ten further patients under investigation in England were confirmed as having swine flu through laboratory testing today , together with 22 in Scotland . \nThis brings the official total since April to 1,784 . \nThe real figure will be significantly higher . \nThe vast majority have had a mild illness with no complications . \nThere are currently six people in hospital in Scotland who have the virus . \nBefore the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . \nFirst , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . \nMost of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . \nSecond , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . \nFor example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . \nBut the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . \nThird , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . \nThe CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . \nGiven those caveats , I think the figures are useful . \nGlobal H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . \nAs of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . \nNow let 's look at some individual countries . \nThe number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . \nThere has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . \nYesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . \nHe did not have the virus . \nA further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . \nOf the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . \nThere was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . \nThree cases have been recorded in Wales . \nHealth Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . \n17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . \nThis represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . \n6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . \nThis can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . \nI will try to investigate further . \nYesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . \nI 'm going to talk here about the risks associated with getting H1N1 swine flu during pregnancy . \nAlthough it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . \nThe patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . \nThe child was born at 29 weeks gestation . \nFew details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . \nHer death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . \nBefore I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . \nMany will have no symptoms at all . \nThe official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . \nBut there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . \nSo instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . \nWith around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . \nSo please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . \nHaving put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . \nThe director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . \nThis heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' \nBut remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . \nFlu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . \nAmong the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . \nHealth advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . \nWhen a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . \nWhat about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? \nDuring pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . \nThere is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . \nOseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . \nBut the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . \n`` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' \nThere are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . \nThe death of a woman suffering from H1N1 swine flu in Scotland is a sad reminder that this is not always a mild infection . \nThis is not only the first confirmed death in Britain , but the first outside of the Americas . \nBut it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent or that people are at any greater threat . \nThe vast majority of the 1,200-plus people who have had the virus in the UK have experienced mild symptoms and then fully recovered . \nThroughout the world , swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . \nIt 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter . \nThe difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . \nIt is likely that cases in the northern hemisphere may tail off in the summer months , with a much bigger outbreak in the autumn . \nThe virus ca n't be stopped altogether , but everyone can help to slow its spread by observing simple hygiene measures , and by staying home if they get the virus . \nDo you want to avoid catching H1N1 swine flu ? \nYou could find a remote , uninhabited island until a vaccine is created . \nI think that 's going a bit far . \nBut the best defense is age . \nSo far , the over-65s has been the group least likely to catch the infection . \nThis has led to me receiving cheery comments from retired people saying that it 's the first time in some while that they 've felt glad to be old . \nSo why are n't they falling ill ? \nThe likeliest explanation is that they have built up immunity over years of exposure to other H1N1 flu viruses . \nThat might also help to explain why most other people get a mild infection . \nBut I 'm still puzzled as to why 30 - to 50-year-olds are suffering a disproportionate amount of severe illness . \nIn fact , I 'm a bit puzzled as to exactly which age groups - under the age of 65 - are most at risk of severe illness . \n`` We know that the novel H1N1 virus preferentially infects younger people . \nIn nearly all areas with large and sustained outbreaks , the majority of cases have occurred in people under the age of 25 years . \n`` In some of these countries , around 2 % of cases have developed severe illness , often with very rapid progression to life-threatening pneumonia . \nMost cases of severe and fatal infections have been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years . \nThis pattern is significantly different from that seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza , when most deaths occur in frail elderly people . \nMany , though not all , severe cases have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions . \n`` Based on limited , preliminary data , conditions most frequently seen include respiratory diseases , notably asthma , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , autoimmune disorders , and obesity . \n`` At the same time , it is important to note that around one third to half of the severe and fatal infections are occurring in previously healthy young and middle-aged people . \nWithout question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . \nThis heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' \nThis was very similar - up to a point - to the briefing yesterday by the CDC in Atlanta . \nYou 'll notice the same emphasis on younger age groups , pregnant women and those with underlying health problems . \nThis is what Dr Anne Schuchat had to say about the US experience of H1N1 swine flu : `` It is a very new virus . \n57 % of the cases that we 're having reported to us occur in people five to 24 years of age , and 41 % of the hospitalisations are in that same age group - the older children and young adults . \nBut I also want to tell you about the rates , the cases per 100,000 population , and let you know that the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under five . \nAnd the next highest rates are in those people 5 to 24 . \nSo it looks like this is a virus that 's disproportionately affecting younger people but there are still lots of infections and hospitalizations in older persons . \n`` According to the US statistics , 71 % of the hospitalized patients have occurred in people who have an underlying condition - respiratory illness like asthma or conic obstructive pulmonary disease , immune deficiencies , and so forth . \nAs we have noted , there 's been a disproportionate amount of pregnant women among those who have had infection . '' \nDid you spot the difference ? \nDr Schuchat made no direct mention of the 30-50 age group , although she did mention that there were lots of people over 24 who are taken to hospital . \nIf the 30-50 year group is especially at risk , it would be good to know . \nI 'm still just in that age group myself , so maybe it 's self-interest at work here . \nNo doubt all will become clearer in the months ahead . \nWhen it does , I will let you know . \nThere were three in the 20th Century . \nThe worst , Spanish flu in 1918 , killed perhaps 50 to 100 million people - but that was before the antibiotic era . \nThe pandemics of 1957 and 1968 killed one to two million . \nEven that sounds alarming , but bear in mind that normal seasonal flu contributes to up half a million deaths per year . \nAnd H1N1 flu is currently so mild that , in terms of deaths , it might not be much worse than a bad normal winter of flu . \nBut it is different in the groups it targets . \nVery few elderly people are catching H1N1 flu , probably because they have immunity due to exposure to similar flu viruses . \nInstead , the peak groups are children and young adults aged 5-24 , followed by children under five , and then adults under 50 . \nMost of those who fall seriously ill , with complications like pneumonia , have underlying health problems . \nPeople will want to know when they are likely to be exposed to H1N1 . \nThat 's impossible to say with any accuracy , but the summer months may suppress the virus somewhat in Britain , and it may be the late autumn or beyond before we see a full-scale epidemic in every community . \nThe government 's pandemic plans suggest that perhaps a third of the population could get infected , causing huge rates of absenteeism from work , and extra pressure on the health service . \nThere is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet . \nA pandemic vaccine is in early development ; it will be autumn before the first doses are ready ; they will be earmarked for front-line health workers and those with health problems . \nAlong with Chile and Japan , these are the countries which are forcing the move to Phase 6 , a global epidemic or pandemic . \nDr Ian Barr is the Deputy Director of the WHO Influenza Centre in Australia . \nHe 's based in Melbourne , which is the center of the flu outbreak there . \nThe state of Victoria has had more than 1,000 confirmed cases of swine flu and Dr Barr said that the government was now changing the way it managed the outbreak . \n`` If someone is ill then we will continue to ask that they stay at home and do n't go out and risk infecting anyone . \nBut there wo n't be a recommendation for quarantining whole families as has happened . \n`` Unless someone falls quite ill they wo n't be given antiviral treatment like Tamiflu and we wo n't trace their contacts . \nWe wo n't close schools if there 's a single case , so it 's a much more relaxed approach than we 've had prior to this phase . '' \nBut Dr Barr said that the virus was not causing serious problems : `` We 've had just a handful of cases admitted to hospital and no deaths . \n`` There 've been very mild symptoms among the 1,000 laboratory confirmed cases and probably thousands more that have not been tested . '' \nWith the southern hemisphere moving into its peak winter flu season , it will be vital to keep a close watch on what happens there in the months ahead . \nScotland , by contrast , is heading into summer . \nThat did not stop 47 new cases being confirmed there today , the highest number for a single day . \nIt takes the total to 311 . \nTen people are in hospital . \nDr Harry Burns , the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland , said that there was no doubt that they were seeing community transmission well beyond the confirmed cases . \n`` The last figures I saw there were between 30 and 40 cases where there was no known source for the infection - it did not seem to be travel-related or connected to a particular outbreak . \nBut sometimes people do n't always remember their contacts '' . \nDr Burns said that there was also no doubt that there were plenty of cases going untested and unmeasured , just as was happening in other countries . \nI asked him whether it was time for a change in approach as is happening in Australia , with fewer school closures and so on . \n`` We are getting close to a change in strategy , but quite how and when it is rolled out we ca n't say yet . \nWe will continue to take scientific advice . \n`` If you have a new travel-related case in a rural part of Scotland where there have been no cases , then you may look for contacts . \nThat might be less so in other areas where there have been lots of cases . '' \nHe has no doubt that the virus is here to stay and he hoped that it would remain a largely mild infection . \n`` But it 's worth preparing for the worst . \nThe nightmare scenario a few years ago was that H5N1 avian flu would reassort with a human flu virus in pigs . \n`` If H1N1 reassorted with H5N1 , it would be important to have some initial protection against the H1N1 strain . \nThat 's why it 's worth creating a vaccine . '' \nSo it 's now just a question of timing . \nWithin a day or so the World Health Organisation will officially declare a pandemic of H1N1 swine flu . \nThe move to pandemic Phase 6 will be official confirmation that the H1N1 virus is here to stay and that it will continue to spread globally . \nIt must be hoped that the world does not over-react . \nIt will probably be months before most of us come into contact with the virus , and when we do , the vast majority will experience mild flu symptoms . \nIt is not an indication that the virus is becoming more virulent . \nIf those messages can be effectively communicated to the public , it could prevent a lot of unnecessary alarm . \nA key decision concerns vaccines . \nSeveral manufacturers now have an H1N1 seed virus strain , and will be doing safety and efficacy testing in the coming months . \nWe do n't know how well the virus will grow or how many doses people will need to be protected . \nGiven the moderate nature of H1N1 it would be inconceivable for the WHO to ask manufacturers to switch completely from production of seasonal flu to a pandemic vaccine . \nMore likely is that companies will try to do a bit of both . \nSeveral countries , including the UK , have contracts to provide enough doses to immunise their entire populations . \nBut despite upscaling in production in recent years , there wo n't be enough jabs to go round globally . \nThe first bulk doses might be ready in the late autumn and would be earmarked for frontline emergency staff and those with chronic respiratory problems . \nIt 's possible that by the time an H1N1 vaccine is ready , the virus will already be spreading rapidly in the northern hemisphere . \nWe will learn a lot from what happens in Australia and other southern hemisphere countries in the months ahead . \nSo are we over-reacting to swine flu ? \nI do n't believe so . \nEven a pandemic of mostly mild illness will still cause huge disruption to business and society during its peak because it mostly affects those of working and school age . \nAlthough the vast majority of those infected get mild symptoms , a few get seriously ill . \nThe WHO estimates that about half the 140 deaths so far have been in young people who were previously healthy . \nWe must also watch out for genetic reassortment - or drift - in the DNA of the virus which might make it more virulent in future . \nThere 's no sign of that yet but it 's another reason why we should all take the pandemic seriously , without the need for panic . \nWhen is a pandemic not a pandemic ? \nWhen the World Health Organization says so . \nWith the virus spreading in Australia , where there 's been a four-fold increase in cases in a week , it might seem surprising that global health officials have not yet moved from the current Phase 5 to 6 , which would mean that a pandemic had been declared . \nPredictions are a mug 's game - but , on BBC TV and radio this evening , I stuck my neck out and said that a pandemic declaration was likely within days , or possibly weeks at the outside . \nThe reason for this was that listening to the WHO 's assistant director general Dr Keiji Fukuda in the weekly media briefing , it seemed to me that the WHO was holding back from declaring a pandemic for political reasons . \nI 'm not suggesting anything underhand , but simply that member states and scientists have advised the WHO that it must prepare the ground before making the move to Level 6 . \nThe WHO ca n't ignore the surge in cases in Australia , and , to a lesser extent , the leap in cases in the UK and Chile . \nDr Fukuda said that he feared `` a blossoming of anxiety '' - in other words , panic - if they suddenly declare a pandemic . \nIt 's true that the word `` pandemic '' sounds scary . \nBut it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease . \nIt is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent ; it has nothing to do with severity ; rather , it is a measure of geographical spread . \nAnd we must remember that the vast majority of people who get H1N1 swine flu have a mild illness . \nDr Fukuda said that it was fair to say that we are `` really getting close '' to declaring a pandemic , but that the WHO wanted to avoid or reduce the sort adverse actions that had happened when it last raised the threat level , such as the culling of pigs , unnecessary concerns over pork , trade embargoes , travel restrictions and concerns about travellers from certain areas . \n`` These are the kinds of potential adverse effects you can have if you go out without making sure that people understand the situation as well as possible . \n`` In earlier pandemics , we have often seen that people who are worried , but not particularly sick , have over-run hospitals and led to a dsyfunction in the health system because so many are going to emergency rooms , adversely affecting people who really require emergency care . \nWe 'd like to minimize the risks of that . '' \nListening to that , it does seem sensible that the WHO first prepares the ground before moving to Phase 6 . \nThe media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over-reacting . \nGovernments , too , have a big role to play , ensuring that their pandemic plans are in place . \nAnd businesses must prepare for the coming of a virus which , even if it is mild , will cause huge numbers of absences from work . \nRemember , though , that when a pandemic is declared , it wo n't make any difference to most of us . \nDifferent countries will experience local epidemics at different times . \nWhat matters is when H1N1 begins to spread rapidly within your community , way beyond schools and unrelated to travel . \nOnly then might the virus make a tangible difference to your daily life . \nTwo experts on infectious disease in Australia say a flu pandemic has effectively already started because of the widespread number of cases there . \nRobert Booy , professor of Child Health at the University of Sydney in New South Wales , urged the World Health Organisation to take action regarding a shift from the current alert phase 5 to the top level , phase 6 : `` The WHO ca n't keep scratching their heads , they have to make a decision , '' he said . \nProfessor Booy , who works at the Children 's Hospital , Westmead , said the H1N1 virus was `` unstoppable '' and would continue to spread around the world . \nHe expressed surprise that the WHO had not already declared a pandemic - a global epidemic of a new flu strain - because the H1N1 virus `` fulfilled the criteria of community spread '' . \nAs yesterday 's post made clear , the WHO has said once we have `` community level outbreaks '' in another region outside the Americas , then a pandemic will be declared . \nThis means that the virus must be spreading widely , beyond schools and unrelated to travel . \nProfessor Booy said his neighbouring state of Victoria now had so many cases they would no longer be testing people with flu symptoms in the community , but rather limiting the test to those who needed hospital treatment . \n`` We have community transmission in Victoria , '' he said . \nVictoria has by far the bulk of Australia 's swine flu cases . \nThe Australian government said that of the country 's 1,211 total confirmed cases , 1,011 had been reported in Victoria . \nThe number of cases in Australia have risen four-fold in a week . \nProfessor Booy said this was unsurprising . \n`` The cycle of infection is about two days . \nFor every one person with the virus , another 1.5 people get infected , so that gets you to a four-fold rise in six to seven days '' . \nProfessor Booy said thankfully the virus was causing mostly mild symptoms . \n`` We have had some hospitalisations , and one person in intensive care , but all are doing well , '' he said . \nFewer than 10 of the flu cases nationwide have required hospital admission . \nThere have been no deaths . \nRaina MacIntyre , professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of New South Wales , said according to the WHO 's definition of a pandemic , `` we are in Phase 6 ; technically we are there already . '' \nBut she added , `` it 's just a guideline , and when the definitions were devised they did n't factor in severity . \nI think the WHO approach is reasonable given that there would be widespread economic , tourism and trade implications if a pandemic was declared '' . \nProfessor MacIntyre explained that the traditional thinking was that a pandemic would be caused by a new haemagglutinin antigen . \nThis is one of the surface proteins on the flu virus , and is responsible for it binding to infected cells . \n`` We thought it would be caused by an H5 or an H9 type , rather than H1 which is not really new . \nWhen you look at the immunological response of the various age groups , people over 65 have a good level of protection , and only people under 18 have no immunity while many young adults have little immunity . '' \nProfessor Booy , who helped draw up Australia 's pandemic flu plan said `` We had many assumptions and one was that a new flu virus would cause high mortality caused by something really novel . \nThe H1 gene has been with us for centuries . '' \nBut he warned that the virus could mutate or `` drift '' in the coming months . \n`` We already know of cases where people have got double infections - both H1N1 and seasonal flu - and that 's what you need for viruses to reassort . '' \nApologies for constantly updating the figures , but I feel it 's necessary at the moment : first , because the virus is continuing to spread ; second , because of the dramatic surge in cases in the southern hemisphere . \nThe World Health Organization 's latest figures show that 73 countries have officially reported 25,288 of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection -LRB- more commonly known as swine flu -RRB- including 139 deaths . \nIt 's worth comparing that with figures a week ago , when there were 17,410 cases in 62 countries and 115 deaths . \nIt 's interesting to see the surge in cases over the past week in the southern hemisphere , which is entering its winter flu season . \nAustralia 's cases have leapt from 297 to 1051 . \nChile 's cases have jumped from 250 to 411 , with one death . \nThe UK has also seen a big increase . \nA week ago , the WHO reported 229 cases ; today it had 557 -LRB- and remember that the WHO figures always lag behind national statistics by a few days -RRB- . \nIf you are keeping track of what 's happening in the UK , the more up-to-date figures are these : in Scotland , 43 more cases were announced today , bringing the total there to 232 ; add four cases in Northern Ireland and two in Wales for a total of 664 - please forgive me if my arithmetic fails me at any point . \n10 of the confirmed cases in Scotland are in hospital , including three in intensive care . \nSeven health care workers are now also among the confirmed cases . \nIt 's worth stressing yet again that the vast majority of people who have contracted swine flu have got mild symptoms . \nSo with 664 confirmed cases in the UK and more than a thousand in Australia , will a pandemic be declared by the WHO - and if so , when ? \nThe WHO defines Phase Six : `` Phase 6 , the pandemic phase , is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5 . \nDesignation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way . '' \nYou might argue that we are already there . \nBut the WHO is looking for what it calls `` sustained disease outbreaks '' in the community . \nWe have plenty of these in North America , and are waiting for them to occur in another of the six WHO regions . \nAccording to Professor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protecgtion Agency , we are not there yet : `` The number of sporadic cases remains under twenty . \nThese are confirmed cases of infection , but where there 's no obvious link with travel or a known case '' . \nProfessor Kessel said that `` we would need to have a significant number of people where you really do n't know how they have got it , for it to be classified as sustained community transmission . \nWe are getting closer to that , but are not there yet . '' \nFinally , a quick update on anti-virals and potential side-effects , which some have asked me about . \nProfessor Kessel said that Tamiflu has so far been used mostly for children in the UK because of the outbreaks in schools . \n`` There have been reports of some side-effects , '' he said . \n`` The most common have been nausea and stomach pain , which is in line with the manufacturers ' written warnings . \nAt the HPA , we have reiterated the advice that it 's best taken with food , as this seems to help . '' \nProfessor Kessel said that when anti-virals were prescribed , the HPA was very clear that this was advisory : `` It 's up to parents and their children together to decide whether or not to take Tamiflu - there is no obligation to comply . '' \nIt 's understandable that H1N1 swine flu has made fewer appearances on radio and television bulletins in recent weeks . \nThere was massive coverage when the virus first emerged and when the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to five , one short of six when a pandemic is declared . \nBut just because swine flu is not getting so much publicity , it does not mean it has gone away . \nNor does it mean that the risk of a pandemic - a global epidemic of flu - has abated . \nA few figures just released show how cases of swine flu continue to rise . \nHealth Protection Scotland has confirmed 22 new cases . \nThis includes two doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , who are thought to have caught it from patients being treated there . \nIt brings the Scottish total to 141 including four patients who are in a critical but stable condition . \nThe Health Protection Agency in England has confirmed 27 new cases , bringing the total to 363 . \nNorthern Ireland and Wales have two cases each . \nIt brings the UK total to 508 . \nIn the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- has also put out new data which it says it will now update only weekly , on Fridays . \nIt has 13,217 confirmed and probable cases and 27 deaths . \nAt present the number of confirmed US cases is rising by about 1,000 per day . \nThe World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- released a new global update earlier today . \nAlthough it lags behind national statistics , it is still the gold standard for assessing the spread of H1N1 swine flu . \nIt reports 21,940 cases in 69 countries including 125 deaths - 103 of these in Mexico . \nAustralia has 876 confirmed cases according to the WHO , up from 501 in two days . \nIt now has the highest case-load outside North America . \nJuly and August will be the peak season for flu in Australia and there are signs that the virus is taking hold there very quickly . \nIf widespread community outbreaks are reported in Australia -LRB- or the United Kingdom , Chile or Japan in the coming weeks it will be a signal for the WHO to declare a pandemic because the virus will have been shown to be spreading widely in two WHO regions of the world . \nThe US has far more cases of H1N1 swine flu than anywhere else so they are beginning to get some more robust statistics which may help in our understanding of how this virus will affect the world . \nDr Schuchat said there was evidence that flu activity was declining in the nation as a whole , with the start of the summer in North America . \nYoung children together with young and middle age adults were those most affected by H1N1 flu . \nUnlike seasonal flu , the virus seems to be sparing the elderly . \nHere are the statistics - the US has : 11,468 probable and confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu -LRB- it 's worth remembering that laboratory confirmed cases in the US represent only a small fraction of the real total -RRB- 770 people have been hospitalised 60 % of all cases are among people aged 5-24 years 42 % hospitalisations are among people aged 5-24 years Next highest group are children under 5 Very low rates of cases and hospitalisations in people over 65 Dr Schuchat said that the CDC had provided several manufacturers with candidate vaccine virus strains . \nThis will enable them to produce pilot lots of vaccine which can be tested for safety and efficacy . \nThat will probably take a couple of months . \nAt that point , the WHO and CDC will have to make the difficult decision about whether to ask manufacturers to bulk produce an H1N1 pandemic vaccine . \nIt 's a difficult call because it would mean reducing the amount of seasonal flu vaccine production . \nGiven that manufacturers are mid-way through the production of seasonal flu vaccine for the northern hemisphere this autumn , those stocks are unlikely to be affected . \nIt is next year 's immunisation in the southern hemisphere which would probably feel the first impact of any switch to pandemic flu vaccine production . \nDr Schuchat pointed out that seasonal flu caused around 200,000 hospitalisations in the US each year and about 36,000 deaths , so this was a disease they took very seriously . \nWorst affected are people over 65 . \nShe said the CDC would be recommending that the usual at-risk groups get immunised . \nIn the US this includes children aged 6 months to 18 years -LRB- a group not targeted in the UK -RRB- , pregnant women , the elderly , those with serious health problems , and anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting flu . \nI think it 's a safe prediction that there will be a record uptake for the jab later this year . \nSo no decision has been made yet about whether to push the button on creating a mass stockpile of H1N1 vaccine in the US , or indeed the world . \nDr Schuchat said they would await the outcome of test vaccine studies and carefully monitor the epidemiology of the virus . \nA decision , she said , would be made in the early autumn . \nOne encouraging fact is that tests of virus samples from around the world have not shown any variations ; in other words , it does n't look like there has been any mutation or drift in its genetic structure . \nHow many people in the UK have swine flu ? \nDo you want the official or the unofficial figure ? \nThe number of laboratory-confirmed cases stood last night at 404 . \nBut there are undoubtedly some cases which have gone undetected . \nProfessor John Oxford , a virologist at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , has come up with a figure . \nSpeaking this morning on 5 Live Breakfast , he speculated that there could be 20,000 infected people in the UK . \nHis theory goes that most of them have had such mild illness , it 's gone undetected . \nI spoke to him afterwards and he stressed that this is a pure `` guesstimate '' rather than a scientific analysis of the figures . \nHe stressed that the number was not meant to be alarming - and that quite the contrary , it shows that the virus causes mild symptoms in the vast majority of cases . \nProfessor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protection Agency agreed that there are some undetected cases out there , but he did n't think that it was tens of thousands . \nHe said that the UK had among the best flu surveillance systems in the world and doubted there could be that many cases . \nThat may leave you none the wiser . \nWe may get a better idea by looking at what 's happening in the United States . \nThere , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that there have now been 11,054 confirmed and probable cases . \nBut it has also repeatedly stated that possibly 19 out of 20 cases are going undetected . \nAs I said in a post on Tuesday , this could mean that there are 200,000 or more people in the United States who have been infected . \nSo can you simply multiply the current official UK figure of 404 by 20 , giving us around 8,000 cases here ? \nIt 's quite a lot less than Professor Oxford 's guesstimate , though still a lot . \nBut there are two differences I can think of between the UK and the US which may make that figure lower . \nFirst , the virus is not as well established here as it is in North America . \nWe are seeing cases pop up out of the blue , but most are linked to current outbreaks . \nSecond , the UK does have a very well organised flu surveillance service , one of the features of our GP network set within a national health service . \nContrast that with the fragmented healthcare on offer in the US and it 's little wonder that surveillance here is likely to be better . \nAll that probably means that fewer cases are going undetected here than in the US . \nWhether it 's a few hundred or many thousands though , it 's impossible to say . \nA nurse in Scotland has become the first health worker in the UK to catch swine flu . \nThe 26-year-old , who works at a Glasgow hospital , had been treating a patient who is now in intensive care with the virus . \nThe details were given by the Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon . \nThe nurse is now recovering at home . \nThere are now four people , critical but stable with swine flu , in hospitals in Glasgow and Paisley . \nA 23-year-old woman from Paisley was admitted today . \nInitially , it was thought that she had no underlying health problems , but Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board later ascertained that this is not the case . \nIt was only a matter of time before Africa recorded its first case of H1N1 swine flu . \nAFP reported that a 12-year-old girl who 'd traveled from the United States has been confirmed as Egypt 's first case of swine flu . \nA government statement said that no other passengers on the flight showed signs of infection . \nEgypt has also had sporadic cases of H5N1 avian influenza , the latest reported yesterday . \nOf the 78 cases of H5N1 reported , 27 have been fatal . \nThankfully , H5N1 is very hard to catch and almost always requires direct contact with infected poultry . \nIt is not an infectious human disease like H1N1 . \nWhat the world is most anxious to avoid is the two viruses mixing . \nI 've just finished listening to the now-weekly press briefing on H1N1 swine flu given by the World Health Organization in Geneva and here are some of the main points . \nDr Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's Assistant Director-General , said that the virus had now reached 64 countries with 18,965 laboratory-confirmed cases and 117 deaths . \n`` We are getting closer to phase six , '' said Dr Fukuda , which would mean that a pandemic had occurred . \nHe divided the global outbreak into three types : countries in North America where virus spread is advanced - Mexico , the United States and Canada ; the group of countries - which he described as being `` in transition '' , some in Europe , some in Asia , also Australia - where a larger number of cases is occurring , many linked to institutions ; countries where there is no real evidence of spread into communities and cases are largely travel-related . \nDr Fukuda said that the countries in transition are moving towards community-type spread and include the UK , Spain , Japan , Chile and Australia . \n`` But we are still waiting for evidence of widespread community activity , so that 's why we are not in phase six yet '' . \nHe went on to say that the WHO was choosing not to describe the outbreak as mild . \n`` This infection can be fatal - in those who have underlying medical conditions , pregnant women and in some people who were otherwise healthy . '' \nAnd he said that we do n't know what will happen in the southern hemisphere in the coming months , or in the northern hemisphere later in the year . \nThe severity of the outbreaks , he said , would vary from location to location , according to the vulnerability of populations and their preparedness . \nI asked Dr Fukuda which age groups were most likely to catch the virus and to die from it . \n`` The majority of people who have got infected are under 60 years of age , although some people over 60 have also got infected , '' he said . \n`` Those who have got severely ill - with complications such as severe pneumonia and those who have died - have tended to be younger to middle age adults aged 20-40 or so , but not exclusively . '' \nThat ties in with the pattern one might expect from a flu pandemic . \nNormal seasonal flu tends to hit the elderly most severely ; in pandemics , it is often young adults who are worst affected . \nAs yet , neither person has any known links to other cases , to travel or to each other . \nThe man is believed to be the first person in Britain to be taken critically ill , suffering only from swine flu . \nThe woman is said to have underlying health problems as does a third patient , a 38-year-old man , who was admitted to intensive care at a hospital in Glasgow last week . \nIf you ask most people where you are most likely to catch H1N1 swine flu , my guess is they would answer , Mexico . \nThat was the case initially , but has not been for some time . \nAlthough most deaths from the virus have been in Mexico , it 's the United States which has been the center of the global outbreak for several weeks now . \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- CDC H1N1 Flu website has reported 10,053 probable or confirmed cases of swine flu , up from nearly 9,000 on Friday and 17 deaths . \nFurthermore , the virus has spread to all 50 states . \nIn one sense that would be worrying , as it would indicate that H1N1 is well and truly here to stay and that a pandemic is almost certain . \nBut it would also confirm that the virus is causing mostly very mild illness , and mean that the death toll from a pandemic might be no worse than with seasonal flu . \nRemember though that scientists are still learning about the virus and are unsure how any pandemic might The World Health Organisation says the global number of confirmed cases of H1N1 is 17,410 in 62 countries , including 115 deaths . \nSince then , Bulgaria and Luxembourg have confirmed their first cases of the disease . \nOne of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in the autumn . \nProfessor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . \nAnother fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . \nOne of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . \nBut Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . \nThat does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around .

{"id": "133", "time": "2009-04-28", "text": "Swine flu outbreak reaches Europe The UN has warned that the virus has the potential to become a pandemic The first cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Europe . \nTwo British people admitted to hospital in Scotland after returning from a holiday in Mexico have been confirmed as having the virus . \nIn Spain , a man has tested positive for swine flu and 17 other people are under investigation , officials said . \nEU health ministers are to meet on Thursday to discuss the outbreak , which health officials suspect has killed about 150 people in Mexico . \nThe World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- raised its alert level late on Tuesday from three to four - two steps short of declaring a full pandemic . \nPersonally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster WHO Assistant Director General Dr Keiji Fukuda said it signalled a `` significant step towards pandemic influenza '' , but added `` we are not there yet '' . \nThe EU 's Health Commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , has advised against non-essential travel to any affected areas . \nBesides Mexico , the UK and Spain , there have also been confirmed cases in the US and Canada . \nSuspected cases are being investigated in Brazil , Israel , Australia and New Zealand . \n`` Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster , '' Ms Vassiliou said . \nThe precaution would `` minimize the personal risk and to reduce the potential risk to spread the infection to other people '' , she added . \nGermany 's largest tour operator , TUI , suspended all trips to Mexico City as a precaution - though holidays to other parts of Mexico would continue as normal . \nScottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said both UK patients were recovering well in a Lanarkshire hospital from mild cases of the virus . \nSwine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu - but in Mexico more than 100 people have died Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission `` The threat to the public remains low , '' she said . \n`` The precautionary actions we have taken over the last two days have been important in allowing us to respond appropriately and give us the best prospect of disrupting the spread of the virus . '' \nThere are 14 other possible cases currently being investigated in the UK , though all the people involved are well enough to be managed in the community , British Health Secretary Alan Johnson said . \nIn Madrid , Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez confirmed that a male patient in Almansa in the south-eastern province of Albacete had tested positive for the virus . \nThe 23-year-old man had arrived home from Mexico with a fever last Wednesday , and was isolated in a hospital ward on Saturday night , she added . \nMs Jimenez said his condition was not serious . \nAt least 17 further suspected cases are under investigation in Spain , in locations ranging from Madrid to Mallorca , Barcelona to the Basque Country . \nThe patients have all recently returned from Mexico . \nNone of the cases is thought to be life threatening . \nRobert Madelin said it was clear that a ` novel ' flu virus was now being confronted Four people tested for the virus in France have been given the all-clear by doctors , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot has said . \nThe WHO has said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain , but officials say they need more information on the virus to determine the threat it poses . \nThey are advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . \nThe H1N1 virus is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . \nThere is currently no vaccine for the new strain , but severe cases can be treated with anti-viral medication . \nEarlier , the European Commission convened an emergency meeting of the health ministers from all the EU 's 27 member states on Thursday to discuss growing concern about the outbreak . \nMexico : 20 confirmed cases -LRB- Mexico puts suspected deaths at 149 -RRB- United States : 40 confirmed cases Israel , Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia and New Zealand : Suspected cases being tested `` The commission is following the situation concerning the swine influenza very closely , '' said Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . \n`` We will continue to assess the information we are getting from the experts , evaluate the potential danger and decide together with member states on the measures to take . '' \nFurther details about Thursday 's meeting have to be worked out by the Czech Republic , which currently holds the EU presidency . \nThe commission 's director-general for health and consumer protection , Robert Madelin , said close co-ordination between EU members was the most effective way to tackle any pandemic . \nHe said the EU was `` putting in place plans agreed in the last five years , ensuring that the level of risk management is appropriate to the risk - using our ` war-games ' experiences '' . \n"}
{"id": "546", "time": "2009-04-28", "text": "HOW SWINE FLU OUTBREAK EMERGED Flu viruses mutate over time causing small changes to proteins on their surface called antigens . \nIf the immune system has met a particular strain of the virus before , it is likely to have some immunity ; but if the antigens are new to the immune system , it will be weakened . \nThe influenza A virus can mutate in two different ways ; antigenic drift , in which existing antigens are subtly altered , and antigenic shift , in which two or more strains combine . \nAntigenic drift causes slight flu mutations year on year , from which humans have partial , but not complete , immunity . \nBy contrast , the new strain of H1N1 appears to have originated via antigenic shift in Mexican pigs The name `` swine flu '' is a slight misnomer as it is believed pigs acted as a mixing pot for several flu strains , containing genetic material from pigs , birds and humans . \nMost humans have never been exposed to some of the antigens involved in the new strain of flu , giving it the potential to cause a pandemic . \nThe new virus has made the jump from pigs to humans and has demonstrated it can also pass from human to human . \nThis is why it is demanding so much attention from health authorities . \nThe virus passes from human to human like other types of flu , either through coughing , sneezing , or by touching infected surfaces , although little is known about how the virus acts on humans . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A which infects pigs . \nThere are many types , and the infection is constantly changing . \nUntil now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form clearly does , and can be spread from person to person - probably through coughing and sneezing . \nWhat is new about this type of swine flu ? \nThe World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the human cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu - but deaths recorded in Mexico It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Too early to say whether it will lead to a pandemic Current treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . \nBut this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . \nFlu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . \nPigs provide an excellent ` melting pot ' for these viruses to mix and match with each other . \nSymptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . \nThese include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . \nMost cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . \nHow worried should people be ? \nWhen any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a global epidemic , or pandemic . \n1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . \nCaused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . \nCaused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . \nThe impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . \nThe elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . \nHowever , experts say it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . \nCurrently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at four on a six-point scale . \nNobody knows the full potential impact of a pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . \nThe Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . \nThe fact that all the cases in the US and elsewhere have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . \nIt suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . \nAlternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at a much later stage than those in other countries . \nIt may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . \nThere is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . \nHowever , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . \nNormal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . \nCan the virus be contained ? \nThe virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . \nThe US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . \nHowever , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . \nUse of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . \nThe UK Government already has a stockpile of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . \nIt is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . \nUS scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . \nA vaccine was used to protect humans from a version of swine flu in the US in 1976 . \nHowever , it caused serious side effects , including an estimated 500 cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome . \nThere were more deaths from the vaccine than the outbreak . \nWhat should I do to stay safe ? \nAnyone with flu-like symptoms who might have been in contact with the swine virus - such as those living or traveling in the areas of Mexico that have been affected - should seek medical advice . \nBut patients are being asked not to go into GP surgeries in order to minimize the risk of spreading the disease to others . \nInstead , they should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice . \nAfter the WHO raised its alert level over swine flu , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office began advising against all but essential travel to Mexico . \nWhat measures can I take to prevent infection ? \nAvoid close contact with people who appear unwell and who have fever and cough . \nGeneral infection control practices and good hygiene can help to reduce transmission of all viruses , including the human swine influenza . \nThis includes covering your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , using a tissue when possible and disposing of it promptly . \nIt is also important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water to reduce the spread of the virus from your hands to face or to other people and cleaning hard surfaces like door handles frequently using a normal cleaning product . \nIf caring for someone with a flu-like illness , a mask can be worn to cover the nose and mouth to reduce the risk of transmission . \nThe UK is looking at increasing its stockpile of masks for healthcare workers for this reason . \nBut experts say there is no scientific evidence to support more general wearing of masks to guard against infections . \nIs it safe to eat pig meat ? \nThere is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . \nHowever , it is essential to cook meat properly . \nA temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . \nThe strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . \nThe latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . \nExperts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . \nHowever , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . \nThose humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person . \nWhere can I get further advice ? \nFurther information and advice on swine flu can be found at websites of leading health and research organizations around the world . \nThe World Health Organisation gives background information on the virus . \nThe UK 's Health Protection Agency advises the public about what to do if returning from an affected area . \nNHS Choices outlines how swine flu is different from other flu . \nThe US government 's Centre for Disease Control is counting the number of cases in the US . \n"}
{"id": "516", "time": "2009-04-28", "text": "Swine flu : How serious a threat ? \nThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 form of influenza A With the UK confirming two cases of swine flu and the World Health Organization raising its alert level from three to four , how serious a threat does the disease pose to us all ? \nWHO says the virus , which has killed an estimated 150 people in Mexico , is showing a `` sustained ability '' to pass from human to human and is able to cause community-level outbreaks . \nThe UK 's leading experts on flu give their views on what the future threat might be . \nPROFESSOR NEIL FERGUSON , WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Clearly we are on track for a pandemic in the coming months . \nThe good news is that we were all worried about so-called bird flu H5N1 which was a much more dangerous virus . \nHere , we are not in the same ball park . \nWe might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic But we ca n't at the moment answer the question is it comparable to 1918 Spanish flu which killed a lot of people - or is it much more like Hong Kong flu . \nWe are coming out of the normal time of year when we have flu circulating in the UK so we do n't really know what size of epidemic there may be in the next couple of months . \nIt is almost certain that even if it does fade away in the next few weeks which it might we will get a sizable epidemic in the autumn . \nWe might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic . \nWe could get substantial numbers infected in the next few weeks . \nIf I was to be a betting man I would say it would be a slightly longer period of time just because we are heading into the summer months . \nSIR LIAM DONALDSON , CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR ENGLAND A new strain of flu is something to which we do not have natural immunity , and we have not been vaccinated against , because there is not a vaccine , so it does mean that many more people are vulnerable and so it spreads more easily and affects more people . \nBut we do n't know enough about this virus yet . \nIt is being studied by the top laboratories in the world . \nWhen we know more about it we will be able to give better predictions about who is at greater risk , and who is at risk of developing serious complications . \nAt this point the picture coming out of Mexico is rather confused , and we ca n't make any firm statements about what is likely to happen , but we have to prepare for all eventualities . \nPROFESSOR JOHN OXFORD , VIROLOGY EXPERT AT BARTS AND THE LONDON If the avian flu H5N1 virus had spread from human to human like this then I would be extremely worried . \nIt would be top of my Richter scale . \nBut this swine flu worries me less because as a population we have a basic immunity to H1N1 . \nOutside of Mexico there have been no deaths , so it does n't seem so aggressive . \nAnd not only are we coming up to the summer , which makes it less likely for these viruses to spread as well , but Britain has enough antiviral drugs for half of the population . \nSo we should not panic in any way . \nThis does not look as though it is going to be a virus that sweeps the world and causes huge mortality . \nDR ALAN MACNALLY , MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EXPERT AT NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY I still think we are a day or so away from knowing what the threat is . \nWHO has gone to stage four , so we know there will be an epidemic stemming from direct contact with these cases in Mexico . \nWe will see more cases . \nBut we will have to wait to see how it spreads to know if there will be a pandemic that sweeps nations . \nThe key thing is how lethal a virus is it . \nOutside of Mexico it has not caused any deaths , which is good news . \nAnd we are prepared for it . \nWe should have a complete picture in the next five to seven days to answer these questions . \nKEITH PLUMB , FELLOW OF THE INSTITUTION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS There is no evidence of pandemic in Europe at this point in time but should the threat increase , the UK has a wealth of scientific and engineering expertise which can be deployed to ramp up the countermeasures necessary to protect the population at large . \nLet 's keep things in perspective . \nThis is not 1918 ; and with over 30 million doses of antiviral treatments , effective against H1N1 available in the UK right now we are well placed to combat any outbreak . \nWe should also bear in mind that there are two flu-vaccine manufacturers in the UK -LRB- Novartis and Medimmune -RRB- and whilst there may be capacity issues , both companies are technically capable of producing appropriate vaccines . \nPROFESSOR HUGH PENNINGTON , LEADING BACTERIOLOGIST It 's a new virus - we 've never before seen this combination of swine virus and human virus genes . \nIt 's very difficult to make any predictions when it 's not like any flu virus before . \nIf there are no more cases in the next couple of weeks then we can maybe say with reasonable confidence that we 're out of the woods . \nBut the flu virus is a pretty awkward customer and you have to be very circumspect . \nI do n't think the public health authorities will be giving the all-clear for some time yet . \nPROFESSOR ANGUS NICOLL , EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL We have a very confusing picture coming out of Mexico . \nWe are not aware of how many people there are with mild infections out of Mexico . \nIt may be that those few deaths represent just the tip of an iceberg which is a lot more much milder infections . \nTherefore we feel that one should not be looking at Mexico and saying that is the pattern we will necessarily be following in Europe . \nWe do know from previous influenza viruses and previous pandemics that what you see at the start is not necessarily what you see six months , a year or two years later . \nSometimes you get a second or third wave which is more vicious than the first . \nAs a region , Europe - and particularly the European Union - is better prepared than any other part of the world . \nUnfortunately you can never prepare well enough . \nWe are beyond the stage of being able to contain the virus , we can only mitigate it and there is still more work to be done - and a cool summer would give us time to do some additional work . \n"}
{"id": "649", "time": "2009-04-29", "text": "Matthew Price reports from Mexico A 23-month-old Mexican child has died of swine flu in Texas - the first death from the virus outside Mexico , where it may have killed as many as 159 people . \nThe child - one of 91 cases of swine flu in the US - had been visiting relatives in Texas when he fell ill . \nThe World Health Organization said the virus was still spreading , even though it was now from person to person . \nAnd Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not traveled to Mexico . \nUS : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases The Mexican boy had arrived in the Texan border city of Brownsville on 4 April and developed flu symptoms four days later , the Texas Department of State Health Services said . \nHe was later transferred to a hospital in Houston , where he died on Monday night . \nThe cause of death was confirmed on Wednesday by Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \n`` Unfortunately this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus , '' he told US TV channel CBS . \nSpeaking in Washington , President Obama offered his condolences and said the federal government was doing the utmost to contain the virus . \nSYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection He also urged local public-health bodies to be vigilant and said schools with confirmed cases `` should consider closing '' . \nTexas Governor Rick Perry said closing the US border with Mexico was an option , but added that taking that step now would be `` a little premature '' . \nThe assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , Keiji Fukuda , said that although the virus originated in pigs , it was now being transmitted from human to human . \n`` It is clear that the virus is spreading and we do n't see evidence of it slowing down , '' he told reporters from WHO headquarters in Geneva . \nHe added that moving the pandemic alert to five - the second highest - from the current four would be a significant step , but was not necessary at the moment . \nHe said the WHO would do so if infected people in at least two countries were spreading the disease to other people in a sustained way . \nThe WHO has said measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . \nFrance will ask the European Union on Thursday to suspend all flights going to Mexico because of the flu outbreak , Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said . \nFrom Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico At the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot . \nThe flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some color . \nHere was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 . \nOne of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried . \nThey are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do . \nIn Spain , the government said the first person to contract swine flu without having traveled to Mexico was the boyfriend of a young woman who had recently returned from there . \nSpanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez said such cases were to be expected . \nIn total , the number of confirmed cased in Spain rose from two to 10 on Wednesday . \nNone of them are seriously ill . \nIn Mexico , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country . \nThe Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country . \nSchools across Mexico have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off-limits . \nMexico City 's chamber of commerce estimated restrictions in the city were costing businesses there at least 777 million pesos -LRB- $ 57m or # 39m -RRB- a day . \nHave you been affected by swine flu ? \nYou can send your experiences using the form below : A selection of your comments may be published , displaying your name and location unless you state otherwise in the box below . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . \n"}

'' \nThe first of the four pandemics was Russian flu - each takes its name from the country where the first case was reported - which emerged in 1889 . \nThis was well before the science of virology had even been conceived . \nIt rapidly spread through Europe , and reached North America and Latin America , lasting until 1892 and eventually killing an estimated one million people . \nMedical facilities were overwhelmed by the 1918 flu pandemic `` We have very little information about this strain , '' says Dr Morens . \n`` But in the mid 1900s , scientists started collecting , and more importantly preserving , serum samples from people who had been alive during the flu pandemic . \nSo there is now some evidence that it could have been an H3 virus . \n`` If it turned out to be true that only limited types of influenza genes have the ability to work in a human virus , that would be important , because you could vaccinate the world 's population against the known possibilities of a pandemic virus , '' he says . \nAlthough at its early stages , work is already progressing on a universal vaccine - one that would stimulate human immune systems to recognize , and raise antibodies against parts of the influenza virus shared by all strains . \nBut , during the last century , the virus has shown a deadly ability to change beyond recognition . \nIn 1918 , an influenza pandemic started that became a global disaster - eventually killing more people than the Great War . \nEstimates of the death toll from the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu range from 20 million to 40 million . \nSome historians argue it could have been as high as 100 million . \n`` There was a mild wave in the spring , but the very serious , lethal wave was in the autumn to the winter , '' says Professor Markel . \n`` Then a third wave in January to April 1919 , and a fourth wave in the winter of 1920 . '' \nThis tendency for `` waves '' of infection and re-infection makes the virus yet more unpredictable . \nNew vaccines for circulating strains are now designed every year At the time the medical consensus was that the disease was caused not by a virus , but by a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae . \nSo some countries , including the US and UK , distributed vaccinations against the wrong disease-causing agent . \n`` Another problem was that the authorities stuck their heads in the sand , '' says Mr Honigsbaum . \n`` Their priority was the war and they did n't have the resources to deal with the health crisis . \n`` There 's an argument that if they 'd been more proactive , and diverted doctors and nurses from the front to civilian needs , they could have saved more lives . '' \nDr Morens refers to the 1918 H1N1 strain as `` the mother of all pandemics '' . \n`` In the category of Influenza A , which is the category of virus that has caused all human epidemics and pandemics , every virus circulated since 1918 has been a descendent of this virus in one way or another , '' he says . \n`` Descendants of the 1918 pandemic are still infecting human beings , but they have mutated again and again and again to be able to survive . '' \nThe 1918 influenza pandemic gripped a vulnerable , unprepared human population , but its ability to `` reassort '' - or exchange its genes with other viruses - was what made it `` dangerously novel '' . \nWe had two lineages of the disease , both of which have persisted National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases `` Every species has its own flu - when those species live together , and they can transmit their flu to different species , the virus itself changes its structure , '' says Professor Markel . \nSince our immune systems recognize and respond mainly to the H and N part of the molecule , scientists suspect that pandemics arise when a strain emerges with a big change in the structure of one of these proteins . \nBut how exactly the virus adapts to enable it to attach to receptors on the cells of a different species , is an `` unanswerable '' question , says Dr Morens . \n`` With only four pandemics in over 100 years , our sample size is too small to say , but it seems that a new H -LRB- on the surface of the virus -RRB- has been the major factor , '' says Dr Morens . \n`` We do n't know where the 1918 virus came from , but the evidence is that it was a new virus . \n`` At the same time that it infected humans , it also infected pigs . \nAnd at that point , we began to have two lineages of that disease - the human virus , and the pig virus , which persisted too , '' he adds . \nThe progeny of the 1918 influenza strain evolved and mutated as they were transmitted from one host to another . \nAnd on two further occasions , these strains incorporated completely new genes and spread globally once again . \n`` That 's what happened in 1957 and 1968 - a hybrid formed of the 1918 virus with genes that were never part of it before , '' says Dr Morens . \nIn the case of the 1957 Asian flu outbreak , a human H2N2 virus combined with the genes of a strain found in wild ducks . \nThe pandemic killed an estimated one million people worldwide . \nAn outbreak of H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 , when avian and human virus genes combined once again , claimed another million lives . \nIn both cases , the impact was minimized by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccines available . \n`` Now , every year , around summer time , a group of flu experts get together and see what strains are circulating so they can design an appropriate vaccine , '' says Dr Markel . \nAnd in the last few years , principally because of the global concern about avian flu , anti-viral drugs that target influenza , such as Tamiflu , have been introduced . \nThe emergence of a virus that crosses a species barrier is extremely rare But Professor Markel points out that , despite having reached new levels of medical preparation , `` we live in a world of emerging infectious diseases '' . \n`` We have learned to take avian flu very seriously , and we have learned to take the animal kingdom very seriously , '' he says . \nBut in the rare event that a virus does develop that is able to cross the species barrier , he points out that the close proximity of domestic farm animals to humans provides an opportunity for human infection . \n`` Human beings travel farther and faster than ever before . \nAll of this means that we are set up for a potential epidemic or pandemic , '' concludes Professor Markel . \n`` We learn more every time , but the story of flu pandemics is still very much a story in progress .

\nNone other than Dr Doom himself , Nouriel Roubini , recently returned from China saying that the authorities recognized the need for change . \nBut there is plenty of room for doubt . \nThe government may have put on the domestic spending taps to avoid recession this year -LRB- and we should all be very grateful that they have -RRB- . \nBut when global demand for toys and everything else eventually picks up , there will still be plenty of Chinese firms eager to meet it . \nMore important , without further reforms , the Chinese economy that comes out of this crisis will still be hard-wired to save a ridiculously high share of its national income . \nThanks to a distorted financial system , firms - especially small ones - will still save a lot more of their profits than they do in other countries . \nAnd the sparse-to-nonexistent social welfare system will still mean that families save every penny they can , not just for retirement but for health and education expenses and to insure against the risk of being laid off . \nAs Dr Roubini 's own RGE Monitor points out , only 10 % of the $ 600bn Chinese stimulus package this year is allocated to social welfare spending . \nEven with reform , China would probably be a high saving economy . \nBut it could save a lot less than it does . \nThe excess means that it inevitably ends up with more than it can possibly invest at home . \nAs I 've discussed many times before , this export of Chinese savings is the flipside of its massive exports of goods . \nNo-one expects that imbalance to go away as a result of the authorities ' efforts to date . \nIndeed , the IMF thinks that China 's current account surplus will actually go up again this year , to nearly $ 500bn , though that 's a smaller rise than in past years . \nIn short , it is very good news that China 's economy seems to be picking up . \nBut it 's too soon to judge whether it will manage the long-term turnaround the global economy dearly needs . \nSo now we 'll be able to borrow more Chinese money to buy Chinese manufactured goods , so they can afford to lend us more money . \nUnless the Chinese are prepared to spend rather than lend we are just increasing borrowing . \nOnly an economist could call this good news . \nAt 16:12 29th Apr 2009 , ghostofsichuan wrote : The only real problem is trying to figure out what can be believed from the Chinese . \nFigures do n't lie , but liars figure ... . \nthis has certainly become more apparent worldwide but China has always been in the forefront of enhanced projections . \nUnemployment , that could lead to soical unrest is still a concern and the uneven distribtion of income between urban and rural areas continues to grow . \nIndividual investors with particular manufacturing interest do not reflect the reality that China will have a difficult time if the other nations are not purchasing their products . \nDo you really think China will realize high percentage growth by selling toys ?

'' \nThe World Health Organisation says it is already in touch with vaccine manufacturers - although is not at this stage putting in orders - but initial work is already underway in national laboratories . \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is looking at the molecular properties of the virus and why it appears to have been more virulent in Mexico is hoping to have produced a `` reference strain '' to send to vaccine manufacturers around the second week of May . \nThe same process will take place in the UK , once the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- receives samples of the virus at its laboratories in Potters Bar . \n`` We will take this virus apart and reassemble it with two genes from the swine virus and the genetic information code for a laboratory virus called PR8 which grows very well in hens ' eggs and is safe for human infection , '' said Dr John Wood , from the HPA 's National Institute of Biological Standards and Control . \n`` When we have recreated this new hybrid virus this will be grown in cells and hens ' eggs ready to distribute to vaccine manufacturers . '' \nThis , he said , should be done within three to four weeks . \nBut it may be at least four to five months before a vaccine is ready . \nClearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine Safety is - unsurprisingly - paramount , as vaccines can often be worse than the disease they are trying to combat . \nAn outbreak of swine flu in 1976 infected 200 people in the US . \nOnly one of them died , but a vaccine administered to 40m people killed 25 and led to 500 others developing Guillain-Barre syndrome , which can be fatal . \nFor those countries now entering the summer months with the flu season behind them , a delay in vaccine is not a real cause for concern . \nBut in the southern hemisphere where countries are entering their winter months the picture would be different if the outbreak were to worsen . \nOne way of administering the vaccine could be by adding a swine flu component to the seasonal flu jab given out in the autumn . \nBut while production facilities are much more extensive than they once were , it could still take several years to produce enough swine vaccine to match global demand if the virus continues to spread and becomes more virulent . \nAnd in the rush to combat swine flu - from which there have been fewer than 10 confirmed deaths - manufacturers still have to keep their eye on producing an effective vaccine for seasonal flu as they do every year . \nIn the US alone there are an estimated 25-50 million cases reported each year . \nThese result in 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths . \nWorldwide there may be as many as half a million deaths each year . \n`` Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine , '' warned Chris Viehbacher , chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis . \nIn any event , swine flu appears to be responding well to anti-viral treatments like Tamiflu and Relenza . \nThese drugs do not attack the virus itself but an enzyme that allows it to spread within the body . \nTaken promptly , they can reduce the severity and length of the illness . \nBut production of sufficient quantities - were they needed - could again be problematic , although pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG have both said they are stepping up production . \n"}

Blessings to all the people who serve in healthcare , your services are needed now more than ever before . \nI am a girl from Finland staying in a village in Oaxaca , Mexico , as an exchange student . \nOn Monday , they told us that we would not be having classes until the 6th May . \nThere are so many rumors here , but you do not know what is true , although it feels really creepy . \nI feel like its just a matter of time until we all get this flu . \nIt seems like it spreads so quickly and so easily . \nThis scares me a lot . \nI really want to stay here in Mexico , I have grown to love it so much during the eight months I have been here , but if this get worse I do not know if I have the guts to stay . \nI arrived in Mexico City on Saturday then flew on to Monterrey for business . \nI am now back in Mexico City and I have brought my meetings forward so I can leave Mexico and fly back to the UK as soon as possible . \nI have literally gone from hotel , to enclosed car , to clients office , wearing my newly acquired mask ! \nWhen I first arrived I was very blas about the swine flu outbreak but now I am concerned . \nI have been here dozens of times before . \nMexico City is usually busy - you normally can not move , but now its very quiet . \nThere is still traffic but the volume is so minimal . \nMy trip from the airport took 20 minutes instead of an hour and ten minutes . \nI am staying at the Four Seasons and on my arrival the restaurants were closed . \nApart from my meetings I wo n't venture outside the hotel . \nI think I am going to stay in my room This morning the breakfast service was available for the few guests staying . \nWhether they will open Tuesday night is another question . \nThe spa and the bars are all closed . \nApart from my meetings I wo n't venture outside the hotel . \nI think I am going to stay in my room . \nPeople are dying and I do not want to put myself in the firing line . \nI phoned British Airways to change my flight from Mexico City to leave as soon as possible back to the UK and initially they said my business class booking could not be changed . \nThey have since updated this directive and I am booked to fly out tomorrow evening at 9.35 pm which is the next available flight . \nI have not done much business but at least I am going home . \nStephen Kyle , Mexico City , Mexico I 'm a 24 years old male and live in Mexico City . \nRight now the principal actions taken in Mexico are of prevention . \nAll cultural , cleric and scholar activities have been canceled , most recreation sites such as movie theaters and parks are closed too . \nAt my work place last night they informed us that we can work from home , but for most people this is n't a possibility . \nI live in Mexico city ... I am actually studying here ! \nMexico city is n't the cleanliest of places and people 's attitude make it worse . \nNearly half of the 20 million people are not wearing their masks and some are acting as if it 's normal to have this flu with their ' I do n't care ' attitude . \nI give the Mexican government an E for effort . \nRumours are flying everywhere and on the news here in Mexico its the same report over and over again . \nSo yes , I am worried . \nI am living in Oaxaca state where reportedly the first death occurred from swine flu . \nThe town here is known for its great surf and relaxed atmosphere , but even here the fear is beginning to enter people 's daily conversation . \nThe mentality of those living here is varied , some feel it is almost a joke and only media hype , but then you have people like myself who just booked the first flight available back to the United States . \nMatthaios Tz , Puerto Escondio , Mexico MONDAY , 27 APRIL , MEXICO AND SPAIN This is something that we are taking very seriously , which is why the government and the authorities have implemented preventative measures - from the use of masks to our recommendation that they avoid greeting one another with a kiss or even a handshake . \nThey have acted correctly . \nIt makes me proud to know that we have such a good system of epidemiological health in Mexico . \nI think that we will see a lower number of new cases in the coming days Dr Alejandro Vargas , Mexico City The hospitals are coping well . \nSome people have complained of long queues - but these are mostly alarmist types . \nPeople should n't be going to hospital just because they 're sneezing . \nIf too many people show up at emergency rooms then the system could collapse . \nBut , we have many hospitals and they have all been working to implement the measures . \nWe have enough anti-virals . \nI had the opportunity to speak with the person in charge of the purchasing of all medications for the Mexican Social Security Institute and they told me that they worked on this the entire weekend . \nThere is definitely enough . \nThe cases that are materialising now are those related to infections that occurred before the measures were put in place . \nHowever , it 's going to be a while before we get the results . \nI think that we will see a lower number of new cases in the coming days and I think the measures will prove to be successful . \nDr Alejandro Vargas , Mexico City I 'm a doctor responsible for managing vaccines in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon . \nOver the last two weeks we started seeing patients with high fever , muscle aches , sore throats and coughs . \nThose symptoms seemed a bit odd for us , but we did n't diagnose them with swine flu as we did n't know about it . \nOn Sunday we had our first death in the area . \nIt was someone who came from Mexico City . \nBut we do n't have the means to confirm whether it was as a result of swine flu . \nWe need to have the means to diagnose people and , most importantly , the means to offer them treatment Dr Vicente Torres , Monterrey , Nuevo Leon , Mexico More than anything , we lack equipment and laboratory kits . \nAll we can do is look at the symptoms and make a clinical diagnosis . \nIn the pharmacies , there is no Tamiflu available . \nThey only have another medication and they do n't even have enough of that . \nSo the vaccines we have are not enough we do n't have the medication required . \nPeople here are not aware that this flu outbreak can kill people . \nOn behalf of all the medical community in Nuevo Leon I 'd like to ask for help to get the medication , so we can treat people . \nWe need to have the means to diagnose people and , most importantly , the means to offer them treatment . \nDr Vicente Torres , Monterrey , Nuevo Leon , Mexico I have been trying to purchase face masks for myself and my family - my wife and two children - but have n't been able to get one anywhere . \nI have visited six pharmacies in the area and all are sold out . \nNone are expecting deliveries until Tuesday . \nI am concerned by this and do n't think it 's good enough , given it 's a measure the government is advising . \nHowever , I have n't seen any clear government advice on where people can get masks . \nMy family and I are all at home and are taking general precautionary measures - such as avoiding any outside contact , going very carefully to the supermarket to do basic shopping and making no unnecessary visits or trips . \nI hope the government is being truthful - it certainly appears to be transparent in its information . \nThe schools are closed , as are public buildings . \nPeople have been advised to stay at home and have been instructed with basic health precautions to take . \nOur health minister has just confirmed a positive case in a small town called Almansa , 50 miles from the capital of the province of Albacete , where I live . \nThere are other suspected cases in the same province . \nIt is very worrying , especially as there are concerns that the numbers of people infected will grow . \nThe main hospital for the province is here in my town and people will be coming here for treatment . \nWe have received no further information yet from the authorities , beyond the case being confirmed . \nWe have just been told to stay calm . \nMeanwhile , everybody is texting each other asking what next ? \nThis is another blow to the tourism industry in Mexico , even though non of the events that is taken place is anywhere near the tourist areas of Cancun , Playa del Carmen or Puerto Vallarta , the news comes across as all of Mexico is affected ! \nAfter wrong reports of drug related violence , military presence etc. in Cancun , which hurt the industry tremendously , now people think that all of Mexico is affected by a virus that is mostly present in the capital . \nI guess the problem is that this is a country where the capital carries the same name as the country , thus when people hear news about Mexico , albeit it refers to Mexico City , they assume it is affecting the whole country . \nI 'm a specialist doctor in respiratory diseases and intensive care at the Mexican National Institute of Health . \nThere is a severe emergency over the swine flu here . \nMore and more patients are being admitted to the intensive care unit . \nDespite the heroic efforts of all staff -LRB- doctors , nurses , specialists , etc -RRB- patients continue to inevitably die . \nThe truth is that anti-viral treatments and vaccines are not expected to have any effect , even at high doses . \nIt is a great fear among the staff . \nThe infection risk is very high among the doctors and health staff . \nThere is a sense of chaos in the other hospitals and we do not know what to do . \nStaff are starting to leave and many are opting to retire or apply for holidays . \nThe truth is that mortality is even higher than what is being reported by the authorities , at least in the hospital where I work it . \nIt is killing three to four patients daily , and it has been going on for more than three weeks . \nIt is a shame and there is great fear here . \nIncreasingly younger patients aged 20 to 30 years are dying before our helpless eyes and there is great sadness among health professionals here . \nFriends working in hospitals say that the situation is really bad , they are talking about 19 people dead in Oaxaca , including a doctor and a nurse I think there is a real lack of information and sadly , preventative action . \nIn the capital of my state , Oaxaca , there is a hospital closed because of a death related to the porcine influenza . \nIn the papers they recognize only two people dead for that cause . \nMany friends working in hospitals or related fields say that the situation is really bad , they are talking about 19 people dead in Oaxaca , including a doctor and a nurse . \nThey say they got shots but they were told not to talk about the real situation . \nOur authorities say nothing . \nLife goes on as usual here . \nYoung people are going to schools and universities . \nBuses and planes go and come from Mexico City as frequently as before . \nEven with two people dead locally , last night the local baseball stadium was full , mainly with young people . \nWhat 's really happening ? \nI know vaccines are good for nothing , and if you take care , maybe you wo n't die , so , why not acknowledge the real situation ? \nI know that the economic situation is not the best , and it will worsen with panic . \nBut panic comes from a lack of information . \nMany people travel for pleasure or without any real need . \nStopping those unjustified trips can help a lot to ease the situation . \nWe must do something ! \nAlvaro Ricardez , Oaxaca City , Oaxaca , Mexico The truth is that it is very strange , what we are living through here . \nThe streets are empty , we are all staying in our houses . \nPeople are only going out to the hospitals , drugstores and to buy food . \nThe great majority have their mouths covered . \nConcerts , festivals , masses have all been canceled , the football matches have all been played behind closed doors . \nOn the television and radio , every commercial break contains information on the symptoms , saying that if you have them to go to the doctor at once . \nAlthough we have been told to go to work as normal on Monday , I am worried because I am employed at a company where there are many people and believe that it could be highly contagious . \nThey say on the news that the cases that are most critical involve people aged 20 to 50 . \nNallely T , State of Mexico Everyone is very frightened , there are few people on the streets and we are all trying to be as safe as possible Right now the situation is quite scary . \nWe 've never been living under such circumstances and it 's caught us completely off guard . \nWe are a developing country so our health system is n't very effective , plus the fact that our city is overpopulated does n't help much ; the government is doing what they can but I do n't think it 's enough . \nSo the future is n't looking too bright . \nEveryone is very frightened , there are few people on the streets and we are all trying to be as safe as possible . \nBut not knowing exactly how the virus works and how it can be killed off creates a horrible uncertainty . \nI 'm being pessimistic but that 's how most people I 've talked to feel . \nIt 's certainly been very quiet where I 'm living in the Historic Centre of Mexico City , whereas normally the center is almost uncomfortably packed at the weekend . \nMost people also seem to be wearing the face masks being handed out by the army around the city . \nThere always seems to be a healthy mistrust of the government here , but I would n't say I 'm sensing a great deal of paranoia or panic . \nIt does seem as though the unprecedented actions being taken by the government to contain the virus do n't match with the statistics being provided , however , so there is some doubt as to whether they 're just being overly cautious or whether things are a lot worse than what they 're telling the public . \nRight now , things are far from under control here . \nAll the museums , zoos , and concert venues have been closed . \nMasses , football games , sporting activities , cultural activities , have all been canceled . \nAll schools will be closed until 6 May , from kindergarten to university . \nWe do n't know what to think , the truth is that the government is n't telling us the truth . \nThis case is worst than we think , some people take this just like a joke but not me , this is serious ! \nAls it seems clear that this illness does n't appear to be affecting the whole country , just Mexico City , the State of Mexico and San Luis Potosi . \nI work as a resident doctor in one of the biggest hospitals in Mexico City and sadly , the situation is far from `` under control '' . \nAs a doctor , I realize that the media does not report the truth . \nAuthorities distributed vaccines among all the medical personnel with no results , because two of my partners who worked in this hospital -LRB- interns -RRB- were killed by this new virus in less than six days even though they were vaccinated as all of us were . \nThe official number of deaths is 20 , nevertheless , the true number of victims are more than 200 . \nI understand that we must avoid to panic , but telling the truth it might be better now to prevent and avoid more deaths . \nYeny Gregorio Dvila , Mexico City The situation in Mexico City is really not normal . \nThere is a sense of uncertainty that borders on paranoid behavior in some cases . \nAt this very moment , Mexican TV is showing how military forces are giving masks to the people in the streets . \nMoreover the news is sending alarming messages for the audience . \nReally , the atmosphere in the city is unsettling , a good example : pubs and concerts are being closed or canceled and people do n't haven thorough information . \nIn this city -LRB- and country -RRB- there is an urgent need for assertive information , no paranoid messages from the government or the Mexican media . \nPatricio Barrientos and Aranzazu Nuez , Mexico City Massive events have been canceled at the National Auditorium - Mexico City 's largest indoor venue with capacity of 10,000 - which has been closed . \nTwo soccer games have been canceled at the Olympic Stadium . \nA sold out game with 70,000 expected attendance will be played behind closed doors . \nAnother game at the famous Azteca Stadium that would draw an attendance of 50,000 will also be played behind closed doors . \nJuan Carlos Leon Calderon , Mexico City It 's eerily quiet here in the capital . \nLots of people with masks , Facebook communities exchanging gallows humor , everybody waiting to see if schools and universities will stay closed for ten days -LRB- as goes the rumor -RRB- . \nAll masks have been used up , and we are waiting for new supplies . \nDr Duncan Wood , Mexico City We will be sick soon and , well , do the math - 400 can infect at least another two per day Yesterday in my office it was a bit surreal walking in to see all in blue masks with deep cleansing of computer equipment and surfaces going on . \nLet 's hope it is contained and does not escalate . \nThe local news is reporting 200 fatalities and reports of flu spreading from areas outside of Mexico City . \nGiven the volume of daily commuter traffic on cramped busses and trains , this may not have to be too virulent to be disastrous in human terms . \nI wonder what controls there will be on flights in and out . \nI work for the government as a head of a computer infrastructure operations department . \nAt work we are doing several actions to try not to expose workers . \nWe sent several home . \nI support the Pumas football team and the very important match with the Guadalajara team will be played behind closed doors . \nMy family and I are going to stay home all weekend . \nWe feel a little scared and confused with the feeling that we are not given being told the truth . \nMany people think the numbers of dead people is higher than we are being told . \nThe whole city is affected , I have a very bad feeling about this . \nTwo of my friends at work are sick , they were sick for a couple of days , they went to the hospital and they sent them back to work . \nThe doctor told them it was just a flu until Friday when the alarm was spread , then they were allowed to go home . \nI work in a call center and I 'm worried because there are no windows in the building so it can not be ventilated and around 400 people work there . \nWe all have talked to our supervisor but no one has done anything not even sterilise or disinfect the area . \nWe will be sick soon and , well , do the math - 400 can infect at least another two per day . \nThe authorities say there 's nothing they can do since it 's a private company and I can assure you , the company I work for is not the only one like this in the whole city . \nUs workers do n't have much protection from our government and if we want to keep our jobs we have to go anyway . \nMy sister got influenza like symptoms two weeks ago . \nShe is fine now , thank god , but similar cases have been showing up since two weeks ago . \nI work for a bank and we were told to take our laptops because there is a high possibility to work from home . \nI have gone out to buy some face masks . \nI 'm a college student in Mexico City , and I can only say that the information that the media has provided does n't seem to be enough , we do not now how serious it is because they have failed to mention it . \nThere have been two ways of responding to this event , the ones that have entered themselves into quarantine claiming that the government is hiding something much more serious , and those who take this as a joke saying that everyone is overreacting . \nTo put a cherry on top all kind of crazy rumors are flying around - that they are going to quarantine Mexico City , that a school and some specific branches of offices and jobs are going to be suspended for days to come , and so on . \nI wish more info was available , for example how to prevent it ? \nHave there been many deaths ? \nIs there a threat of an epidemic ? \nI did n't hear about the flu epidemic until Friday night at 2330 . \nYesterday the streets were almost empty compared to a normal Friday afternoon . \nThe media is bombarding the same information over and over again , but the authorities have n't said anything new yet , only that they have enough vaccines for those with the flu and that we should avoid public spaces . \n"}
{"id": "23", "time": "2009-04-29", "text": "Mexico to re-test swine flu cases The widow of swine flu victim Gerardo Leyva first heard of the cause of his death when an Associated Press reporter contacted her , the news agency says Stricter swine flu tests have cut the number of confirmed deaths in Mexico , where the virus was first reported , from 20 to seven , authorities say . \nBut officials warned the number of deaths likely to have been caused by swine flu has risen to 159 with more than 1,300 patients under observation . \nThe number of cases globally is rising though no-one outside Mexico has died . \nGermany has become the latest country to confirm cases of the H1N1 virus , reporting three sufferers . \nCountries with suspected cases : Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia , and South Korea , and seven EU states All three recently returned from Mexico , officials said . \nSpain and the UK earlier confirmed two cases each and six other EU states have been monitoring patients suspected of having the virus . \nAt 64 , the US has the greatest number of confirmed cases outside Mexico . \nThe state of California has declared a state of emergency and President Barack Obama is asking Congress for an additional $ 1.5 bn dollars to bolster the US response . \nA US federal health official , Dr Richard Besser of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on Tuesday : `` As we continue to investigate cases here , I expect that we will see deaths in this country . '' \nCanada , New Zealand and Israel have also detected the virus , and other states with suspected cases include Australia , South Korea and Peru . \nIn Mexico , there is some confusion over exactly how many people died from H1N1 , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs reports . \nFrom Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico The first fatal case of the virus is believed to have been contracted here in Oaxaca . \nIt is a tourist center and the obvious concern is that when the visitors leave , they may take the virus with them . \nAt the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot . \nThe flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some color . \nHere was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 . \nOne of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried . \nThey are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do . \nI tried at the local hospital to get more information but the ministry of health has ordered its staff across the country to remain silent . \nThis is largely because the government is now subjecting the samples it has from deceased patients to a more laborious verification process . \nMeanwhile , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country . \nThe Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country , our correspondent adds . \nThe capital , Mexico City , has banned restaurants and cafes from serving all food except takeaways to try to prevent the spread of the virus . \nSchools across the country have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off-limits . \nCalifornia governor Schwarzenegger : ` We are taking strong and swift action ' Mexico City 's chamber of trade estimated restrictions in the city were costing businesses there at least 777 million pesos -LRB- $ 57m or # 39m -RRB- a day . \nPeople have been canceling beautician appointments , wary of close physical contact , Reuters news agency reports . \n`` The customers are scared stupid - they do n't want to go out , '' said hairdresser Esther Gonzalez . \nThe World Health Organisation has called a meeting of scientific experts for Wednesday to discuss the situation and the exact nature of the outbreak . \nSYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Earlier , it confirmed that the flu was being transmitted between humans and called on countries to check their contingency plans for a possible pandemic . \nBut the WHO also urged caution , saying measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . \nSpain is one of the countries outside the Americas most vulnerable to the virus because of the sheer volume of its air passenger traffic with Mexico . \nIt has two confirmed cases of swine flu and a further 32 people are undergoing tests . \nThe government says the situation is `` under control '' , that no lives are at risk and that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission within Spain . \nThere is great fear among the medical community ... One of my colleagues that was exposed chose to stay in a hotel rather than run the risk of infecting her daughters Dr Guadalupe , BBC News website reader in Mexico Instead , it says all those under observation fell ill after visiting Mexico . \nAll incoming passengers from that country and the US are being asked to fill in forms with medical information and contact details and airlines have been ordered to carry surgical masks . \nWith more than 30,000 passengers a month traveling from Mexico to Madrid , swine flu is a logistical challenge , the BBC 's Steve Kingstone reports from the Spanish capital . \nThe authorities are preparing for the long haul , our correspondent says . \n"}
{"id": "406", "time": "2009-04-29", "text": "Mary Hockaday | 17:45 UK time , Wednesday , 29 April 2009 This week , one story has been prominent in our output : swine flu . \nIt 's a story which has involved our reporters in Mexico , the US , Europe , Scotland and the rest of the UK , plus our medical and science specialists . \nAnd it has challenged us to think hard about our public service role on this kind of news story . \nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . \nVisit BBC Webwise for full instructions . \nIf you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . \nEssentially , our task is to give you the facts ; to tell you what we know , but also explore what is n't known ; to give you the best scientific and medical information and to inform but not to alarm . \nThere is a great deal of coverage in all the media which has led to a debate about whether the threat is being overplayed . \nWith any public health story , there 's a risk that raising awareness can raise concern . \nWe have sought at every step to report the science soberly and responsibly , with due weight given to the uncertainty of what will happen . \nWe know that audiences have many questions . \nFor the first couple of days , the comments and questions were coming in thick and fast , though they have now slowed . \nThe majority has been from the UK , but there are considerable numbers from Europe and the US too . \nYesterday , BBC Radio 5 Live did a phone-in , taking listeners ' questions about the outbreak 's impact and attempting to answer them using medical and travel experts . \nThose contacting the network had a range of questions : `` My son 's an hour and a half from Mexico City - how exposed is he ? '' \n`` Are anti-viral drugs safe for pregnant women ? '' \n`` I 'm booked to go to Mexico on 30 April ; the airline wo n't let us cancel and get a refund , what are our options ? '' \nTo satisfy those members of our audience who 've been contacting our programs and website with questions , we put together a comprehensive Q&A . \nIn our current Have Your Say debate on the subject , many contributors have now said they believe that the government and media are over-reacting . \nAnd World Have Your Say - the World Service global discussion program - was presented from the rooftop of a hotel in Mexico City yesterday . \nIt asked its audience if the world was over-reacting to swine flu . \nWe heard from many , including Abdullah in Abuja who e-mailed to say that there really was no comparison between swine flu and the kind of diseases many African nations deal with on a daily basis . \nThere are voices raising important questions about media coverage of this virus . \nBen Goldacre - a medical doctor who writes the Bad Science blog - says that he 's been struck by the number of people contacting him to say `` Is swine flu just nonsense ? '' \nand that the media is `` utterly '' mistrusted on its reporting of health issues . \nSimon Jenkins , writing today in the Guardian , has said the media has whipped up a panic in order to posture and spend . \nSo far , the balance we have been trying to achieve is to report what we know and , critically , what is n't known , using the science available - for instance from the Chief Medical Officer for England , Sir Liam Donaldson and the World Health Organization - as well as what respected scientists are telling us about the possible pattern of this illness . \nAt our editorial meetings , we have been regularly discussing how to get the approach , tone and use of pictures right , and to make sure that we offer our expertise and subject depth via our website . \nInterestingly , the signs so far suggest that the public is not panicking - listeners contacting BBC Radio 1 's Newsbeat are showing a distinct shift in opinion . \nTwo days ago , they were expressing serious concern , but now - for many - it 's receding : `` Swine Flu has changed what I 'm doing . \nI yawned at the last radio update . \nI 'd probably not have done that if Swine Flu was n't mentioned . '' \nThis virus - and this story - may fade away , or it may grow . \nAt this point , as our correspondents are saying , we simply do n't know . \nI hope that our reporting in the past few days will help you make sense of what emerges in the next few days , whichever way it develops . \nMary Hockaday is head of the multimedia newsroom At 18:20 29th Apr 2009 , vampfan wrote : I have never been inclined to comment on any news item before tonight -LRB- I am a massive fan of your Being Human series . . \nhence the name -RRB- but I just had to comment on your first item tonight , Swine Fever ... the family you showed us ... come on , surely , no immediate threat to them , just a classic example of people willng\\/wishing to jump on the news bandwagon . \nWhilst I would never minimize the threat of swine fever , I watch BBB news to be informed ... please do n't do a ` red-top tabloid on me . \nWhy is it sometimes called swine fever yet mainly referred to as swine flu ?

'' \nEvery serious health crisis humans face , including all the problems complicating life for Africans , links back to a problem with population . \nReckless procreation -LRB- and no , I do not mean accidental pregnancies that befall very young people out of naivete , but rather the deliberate intention , through marriage and polygamy and conscious promiscuity by African males -RRB- to beget as many souls as possible exacerbates all problems . \nWhen in times of famine grown people insist on conceiving new children only to watch them die in agony , over and over again , the chance of finding effective solutions for the diseases that plague malnourished and immunity-depressed populations withers on the vine . \nAny married person knows that it is not necessary even to have available contraceptive devices , instructions , medicines or treatments to regulate the frequency of children being conceived . \nAll that is really required to have a reasonable number of offspring -LRB- and for some people ` reasonable ' might mean Zero -RRB- is common sense , a little reason , a good heart and some self-control . \nThere are many ways to be close and happy together that do not involve creating new people or risking infections . \nEvery nation and even every family that has ever advanced in life has done so because it exerted great effort , even in the face of dreadful odds . \nJapan overcame the horrors of Hiroshima & Nagasaki . \nThe list of other awful tragedies is long , and you know it . \nWhen people stop making excuses and blaming others , and get busy working out what they do indeed personally control that they can through personal dedication change , suddenly everything becomes a lot easier to accomplish . \nAt 10:13 30th Apr 2009 , MutantFriend wrote : I want to register my appreciation for the way your science editor has presented his segments in your news coverage . \nHe seems a lone voice of calm , presenting useful facts in a clear manner that actually helps the public . \nWhat a contrast to the rest of the output with the giant graphics of viruses , endlessly repeated pictures of face mask wearing travellers , endless use of buzz words , -LRB- phase 5 , global pandemic , H1N1 etc -RRB- ; that feeds the fear and boosts your audience . \nThis is n't bubonic plague or ebola , it 's flu ! \nWe have effective treatment and well developed plans . \nIt should n't be ignored , but the key advice is being swamped by your obsession with exploring the unknown . \nLike it or not , your reporting inFLUences behavior . \nPlease make sure the facts are given due prominence , and the official advice is highlighted . \nAt 10:21 30th Apr 2009 , Pattermanpat wrote : I think your many cynical callers are right to have been so . \nAnother dimension is that of pharmaceutical companies promotional activities . \nAnti viral drug stocks only sell when they are used or when bought by health organizations oftimes only to lie in their stocks unused until out of date and eventually thrown in the bin at cost to the public purse . \nA pandemic scare is a great sales advert for the manufacturers of drugs just as a war provides sales opportunity for arms manufacturers . \nBig business corrupts governments and rules the world I am afraid . \nThe Scottish Government is setting up a helpline immediately The so called UK government is not planning one until the autumn . \nThank goodness the NHS in Scotland is controlled by the Scottish Government and Nicola Sturgeon is our Health Secretary Did we not pass this way with Bird Flu ?

{"id": "571", "time": "2009-04-27", "text": "Medical Correspondent , Fergus Walsh , finds out what UK scientists are doing to combat swine flu For years now global health experts have been warning that a flu pandemic was overdue - a new strain would emerge to which there was little immunity , causing widespread epidemics . \nThe fear has been that a pandemic could cause tens of millions of deaths and official predictions here suggest the death toll in the UK could range between 50,000 and 750,000 . \nThis is why there is so much concern about the spread of swine flu , but the plain fact is that no-one knows yet whether this is the virus which will trigger the first pandemic since 1968 . \nOne puzzling element is that there have been no deaths outside Mexico . \nSo although the virus is spreading internationally , it is not yet a global killer . \nIt is possible that a new flu virus might spread worldwide causing mostly mild illness , or that it might mutate at some point and become more or less virulent . \nIn the immediate future , two important tasks faced by scientists are to develope rapid diagnostic tests for swine flu and to identify the optimum strain of flu to be used in a vaccine . \nLive samples of swine flu are to arrive in UK labs imminently The National Institute for Medical Research -LRB- NIMR -RRB- , in north London , is one of only five World Health Organization collaborating centres for influenza research . \nIn a high level containment lab , UK scientists are getting ready to receive live samples of swine flu , which they intend to analyze in the hope of combating this disease . \nThe samples will come from affected patients in California , and possibly Mexico and Spain . \nThe scientists at the NIMR will take different virus samples , grow them and infect laboratory ferrets with them . \nFerrets get flu in a similar way to humans and produce an immune response . \nScientists will analyze the antibodies found in the ferrets ' blood and see whether the virus is showing signs of antigenic drift - in simple terms whether it is adapting and changing as it passes from person to person . \nSwine flu is an H1N1 virus , but it seems quite distinct from the human H1N1 strain included in the current seasonal , winter vaccine . \nIt is unclear whether the seasonal vaccine would give any protection . \nOne theory is that while it might not prevent someone getting swine flu , it could lessen its effects . \nFor the moment , swine flu is not a cause for alarm in Britain , and it can not be caught from food , although raw pork should be properly cooked . \n"}
{"id": "244", "time": "2009-04-27", "text": "Swine flu causes regular outbreaks in pigs Infection control experts are scrambling to respond to outbreaks of swine flu in Mexico and the US , and suspected cases elsewhere . \nSwine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs . \nCaused by influenza type A , there are regular outbreaks among herds of pigs , where the disease causes high levels of illness but is rarely fatal . \nIt tends to spread in autumn and winter but can circulate all year round . \nThere are many different types of swine flu and like human flu , the infection is constantly changing . \nCan humans catch swine flu ? \nSwine flu does not normally infect humans , although sporadic cases do occur - usually in people who have had close contact with pigs . \nThere have also been rare documented cases of humans passing the infection to other humans . \nHuman-to-human transmission of swine flu is thought to spread in the same way as seasonal flu - through coughing and sneezing . \nIn the latest outbreak it is clear that the disease is being passed from person to person . \nIs this a new type of swine flu ? \nThe World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . \nBut this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . \nFlu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . \nSymptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . \nThese include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . \nMost cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . \nIs it safe to eat pig meat ? \nThere is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . \nHowever , it is essential to cook meat properly . \nA temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . \nHow worried should people be ? \nWhen any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a pandemic . \n1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . \nCaused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . \nCaused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . \nThe impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . \nThe elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . \nHowever , it is stressed that it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . \nCurrently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at three on a six-point scale . \nNobody knows the full potential impact of the pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . \nThe Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . \nThe fact that all the cases in the US have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . \nIt suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . \nAlternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at much later stage than those in other countries . \nIt may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . \nThere is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . \nHowever , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . \nNormal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . \nCan the virus be contained ? \nThe virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . \nWhat about treatments and vaccines ? \nThe US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . \nHowever , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . \nUse of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . \nThe UK Government already has a stockpile of around 33 million doses of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . \nIt is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . \nUS scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . \nThe strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . \nThe latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . \nExperts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . \nHowever , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . \nThose humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person . \n"}

'' \nShe was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really Ms Fleming lived with her two other children - one aged 18 and one of primary school age - and her long-term partner in the family home in Thornliebank , just south of Glasgow . \nWilliam Docherty , who knew Ms Fleming , told BBC Scotland he believed she had been admitted to hospital following a stroke . \nA female friend of the family said : `` I think they are taking it really badly . \nShe was in hospital for a couple of weeks and there were days she was getting better and days she was taking a turn for the worse . \n`` They hoped she was going to pull through and it was a shock when she died . \nThe family are really devastated .

{"id": "372", "time": "2009-06-15", "text": "Fergus Walsh | 10:25 UK time , Monday , 15 June 2009 I 'm going to talk here about the risks associated with getting H1N1 swine flu during pregnancy . \nAlthough it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . \nThe patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . \nThe child was born at 29 weeks gestation . \nFew details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . \nHer death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . \nBefore I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . \nMany will have no symptoms at all . \nThe official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . \nBut there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . \nSo instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . \nWith around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . \nSo please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . \nHaving put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . \nThe director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . \nThis heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' \nBut remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . \nFlu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . \nAmong the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . \nHealth advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . \nWhen a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . \nWhat about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? \nDuring pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . \nThere is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . \nOseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . \nBut the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . \n`` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' \nThere are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . \nAt 11:07 am on 15 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Give pregnant women massive priority . \nThe health authorities are dealing with two people , not one . \nPregnancy and childbirth is a high risk time all of the time . \nIf it is unwise to give certain antiviral drugs to pregnant women then it stands to reason , to reduce unnecessary contact with the rest of us until such time as the baby is born . \nWe can reduce the risk to pregnant mums by keeping well away if we have been in contact with or have this new flu . \nShopping for food online is a bit safer than the weekly scrum in the supermarket . \nGet someone else to do the supermarket run . \nAnti natal appointments could be run from an alternative location away from the germ ridden doctors surgery . \nLuckily , most hospitals for childbirth are set apart from the general hospitals . \nHome deliveries are risky at the best of times and should not be an alternative for safe hospital delivery , where specialists are always at hand . \nPregnant mums may already have a toddler at the local nursery , playgroup or school . \nOther mums could reduce the risk of flu contact , by making sure their own children do not have symptoms of flu or other infectious diseases before sending them of to school each morning . \nIt only takes two minutes to check a temperature . \nSchools and nurseries could be more pro-active and less politically correct and simply refuse to allow a child to attend if they are obviously ill . \nThe temptation will be , to allow a child back to nursery before the child has got over the infectious stage , if the child appears apparently well . \nDo n't forget , if you knowingly take risks , you risk the health of others . \nThat 's the first time - as far as I 'm aware - that anyone from government , or any journalist , has actually admitted that there may well be a significant difference between the ` official ' figure and the real figure of infections . \nNow , as has already been stated on these blogs , the official figure is the number of reported and confirmed cases - and it may be relevant to consider that some , perhaps even many , of these persons have recovered from the infection and would no longer be an infection risk to others . \nSo in terms of people assessing how likely it is that they will come into direct or indirect contact with an infectious person and thereby risk becoming infected - these figures are particularly useless in many respects . \nAnd is n't that really what people want some idea about ? \nThe risk to them ? \nIn fact , I almost wonder why the government is bothering to constantly publish these figures and the media report them ! \nAt 3:04 pm on 15 Jun 2009 , 32weeks wrote : Well , not even all newspapers today mentioned that the woman was pregnant when she contracted the virus , let alone that she gave birth to premature baby before passing away days later . \nThere is very little information about the virus and pregnant women in general , and I notice that even though there is a lot of data already collected by WHO about the cases -LRB- and disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women -RRB- the official documents regarding the virus have not been updated since they were first issued . \nIt is appalling that only with the first lethal case some more information is siphoning through the media , though barely adequate . \nHere is an idea to chew on . \nA mad , random , scientific idea is that bacteria make the rain fall . \nThe info is on the BBC site today and is on radio 4 tonight at 9 pm . \nAs a child , when it rained , I was always told to wear a rain mac , dry my hair thoroughly , take an umbrella with me or I ` would catch my death of cold ' if I got wet in the rain . \nIt always used to puzzle me because the same restrictions were not in place when I went to the beach and enjoyed bathing in the sea . \nAre viruses able to temporarily host on the bacteria that ` seed ' the rain and possibly make rain fall ? \nIt is interesting , because if bacteria can alter the temperature that rain freezes , then it might explain why antifreeze works or why salt prevents water freezing at zero . \nThe bacteria are being killed or attenuated by the salt and alcohol . \nFergus , I would echo Sutara 's comment above . \nFar more relevant than the historic number of recorded cases is the number of recent cases within any geography . \nIt may be , for example , that H1N1 has practically died out in some regions or countries that have previously reported cases , but we the public , ca n't tell . \nCould the BBC please issue a revised map of cases within the past 10 days , or some medically relevant period ? \nIt ca n't be that difficult to produce based on the statistics published already . \nAt 07:56 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : The double tragedy has moved me to tears this morning . \nMy deepest condolences for the family and friends . \nAt the end of the day , people matter , not maps , not numbers , not who is right and who is wrong , just people . \nI completely agree that this family now has to try to come to terms with an especially tragic situation , at a time when they expected to be celebrating the baby 's arrival home . \nAnd it is because people matter that many just want some clear idea about the risks involved , presented to them in a straight-forward way , neither hyped up , nor dumbed down . \nIn the final analysis most people want to be self-determining and want the information so that they themselves can `` manage '' the risks involved to the best of their ability . \nUnfortunately , probably for a whole number of reasons including the operational cultures of Health Trusts and civil servants , the information being published is n't actually particularly helpful to the metaphorical man on the Clapham omnibus . \nPeople do n't want `` command and control '' from the authorities , they just want clear useful informaton . \nAt 08:37 am on 16 Jun 2009 , Sutara wrote : Additionally , they want to understand basic things like how long people are infectious for , so that they do n't accidentally endanger themselves or those near and dear to them - especially if that would involve anyone from a ` high-risk ' group . \nYou know , most of the decision-making that will make most difference to managing this outbreak , wo n't be done by doctors , nurses , or a government Health Secretary , it will be done by ordinary people in homes , offices , shops , etc. , up and down the country . \nAt risk of sounding cynical , the authorities have lost control of this infection , so it 's time to empower the ordinary people to deal with it the best they can . \nAt 10:13 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Sutara , I understand your concern about incubation and infection times . \nI am not an expert on this matter but I have information about flu types in general . \nMy information is from a published source , not intended for the general public but for health agency workers in the field . \nNormal flu has an incubation time of about 2 days which can stretch out from 1-4 days . \nA new flu like H1N1 may behave differently and could range from 2-5 days , possibly 8 , who knows ? \nInfection time for normal flu is up to 5 days in adults and stretching out to about 10 days in children . \nAgain , this is all depending on circumstances . \nIt has been known for flu to last from 2-3 weeks , but that would be an exception and not the rule . \nHow do you package that information into a sensible format that is not overreactive , straight forward and does n't confuse or alarm people ? \nBeing overcautious is as harmful as not cautious enough ! \nWe all have to interact with each other and continue normal lives . \nThe economy is dependent on our ability to make sensible decisions and be available for work . \nA good piece of advice would to maintain a social distance of 1 meter wherever possible . \nThe flu virus has difficulty infecting you at a further distance . \nMasks are suitable only for preventing your sneeze mixture of bodily excretion and virus , expelling out and jumping the 1 meter distance to infect someone else . \nA clearer idea of incubation time and infection time for H1N1 may be coming out of America where they would have been busy gathering statistics to plan for future outbreaks . \nI reckon it 's quite easy - you find a term , say ` stimated current infection rate ' . \nBased on the reported positive cases and when they were reported , you publish a figure , country by county in the UK , of the estimated current percentage of the population who are currently infected , perhaps that would be those whose infection was between 1 and 10 days old . \nYou provide a simple explanation of the figure , clarify that it is n't written in ` tables of stone ' , and that it needs to be regarded as indicative only . \nEven if someone says their flu started last Monday , when it really started last Tuesday , it does n't matter as you work on the basis that such errors will either cancel out or have a fairly consistent effect on the figure . \nSo you might then end up with a figure for Scotland of say 0.01 % , one for England of whatever , etc. . \nWhoops - that should have been ` estimated current infection rate ' . \nUnfortunately it 's not quite that simple . \nNew cases reported on a particular day are really the cases that were confirmed in lab tests from the day -LRB- or night ? -RRB- \nThe swabs for the tests would have been taken from patients presented to a doctor or nurse -LRB- for testing -RRB- at some point from say 12 hours prior to up to 48 hours , possibly more , before . \nHow long depends on how fast the labs work , how long it takes for samples to reach them and be performed . \nAlso , suspected cases will have been swabbed at different points in their infection . \nThe cases that the postitive tests refer to could have started their infections anything from the day before to up to 7 days previously -LRB- assuming it took them 5 days to be tested and 3 days for test to run and processed -RRB- , possibly longer ago . \nThere is also natural variation in how long incubation and infectious periods last in different people , even for a short lived infections like flu ; the upper and lower limits of these periods are still uncertain for the new H1N1 flu strain . \nSo to calculate when confirmed cases first became ill accurately you need to know several processes with high precision , and mostly these are unknown currently . \nFrustrating , but that 's the trouble with asking good , tricky to answer questions ! \nOf course , one could always ask the cases themselves when they first got symptoms , which I 'm sure has been done by the HPA and other . \nAt 11:11 am on 17 Jun 2009 , worriedofessex wrote : I have just found out I am pregnant -

Make everyone who has it stays at home until they get better ! \nAnd wash your hands to stop it spreading . \nAlso , it would just be gross anyway if you did n't wash your hands . \nHere in Wisconsin we have 3 confirmed cases -LRB- no deaths -RRB- of H1N1 flu and the governor has declared a state wide health emergency . \nMany closed schools and general panic and hysteria on the TV and radio . \nMeanwhile 2 people die daily of HIV in the state and in Washington DC the death toll is about 41 people daily . \nThis , apparently , constitutes nothing . \nGet some perspective for goodness sake . \nThis is a mild flu and would have gone unnoticed but for the Mexican health ministers hysterical over playing the case and WHO cynically using it as an opportunity to test their preparedness for a real emergency . \nWhy not provide a universal call number such as 944 so that a suspect is seen by a Health Organization at once and given Tamiflu if required ? \nGeorge Wu , Chula Vista , U.S. . \nIt would seem that some think its nothing to be worried about , and they 're right , concerned would be a better word . \nBut for those who think this is scaremongering , I wonder if these same people would be the people who would want heads to roll if nothing had be done to halt it . \nI 'm not from a clinical background , but I do know that a pandemic has been expected for quite some time , in fact it 's long overdue . \nThe bottom line is , we should let our guard down until we know for certain its not going to be a pandemic . \nNone - as there is nothing I can do about it . \nI already use a handkerchief , tissues , etc. . \nThis has never stopped me getting flu & probably not stopped me from passing it on . \nThe high death toll in 1918 was a consequence of 4 years of war and resulting stress , poor health care and diet . \nWhile sympathising with those who have died , most who catch the virus live . \nThere will not be 20 million or more deaths this time . \nWe are overreacting to a false threat . \nI returned from Cancun on the 17th April just before all the panic happened . \nI am perfectly healthy and went on holiday as I needed some sunshine to recover from a series of colds over the winter . \nWe probably take more virus into Mexico than we bring out . \nCortez and his army brought Mexico the cold virus first . \nI 'm soon going to repatriate to the USA . \nWhile some countries are over-reacting to this swine flu epidemic there is no hiding the fact this virus will spread irrespective of draconian airport procedures , quarantining measures or culling pigs . \nIt is important for these various governments to act responsibly and disseminate accurate information to their citizens instead of creating panic and clear cases of discrimination against Mexican citizens . \n"}

'' \nMexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing . \nInternational experts are more cautious - but one , Nancy Cox , chief of America 's Center for Disease Control 's influenza division , said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly . \n`` We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus , '' she said . \nIn cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . \nThe WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . \nIn Hong Kong , the authorities have raised the alert level to emergency but urged residents to carry on life as normal . \nUS : One death , at least 141 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission `` I stress we do n't need to panic .

\nWhy do you wish us to live our lives in constant fear ? \nWhat if someone is diagnosed with this and refuses to take the medication ? \nIs there a goverment , local or nation directive in place ? \nAs some people will refuse treatment , how can quarantine in one 's own house work without guards ? \nAndrew Lindop , Connahs Quay - I could n't agree more with your comment . \nOver Christmas I had a terrible flu and had to work on Christmas Eve 8pm to 9pm despite being terribly ill . \nThis is because we are not allowed to call in sick over the Christmas period ! \nAs a result a couple of people caught the same flu not long after me ! \nI think we should all stay indoors and play video games , eat cakes and listen to Elvis . \nThis is the UK therefore we ca n't contain any pandemic . \nRemember bluetongue , foot and mouth and all the others that this shambolic government failed to contain . \nWe 'll get more of the same again . \nBut it wo n't be anyone 's fault , it never is . \nI think the media has really hyped this up way out of proportion before gathering all of the facts , the WHO has n't helped by escalating it to a five either . \nI expected more from responsible adults , than flapping around causing a mass panic amongst the naive . \nLook , there have been 17 deaths confirmed due to the swine flu virus worldwide , all of them Mexicans . \nHow does this justify the global panic about this non-event ? \nIt 's about the same as the number of people killed every two days on Britain 's roads ! \nI just would like to say well done to Hong Kong that acts more seriously and better than other countries to prevent spread of flu virus . \nQuiet news week is it ? \nGet a grip folks , new strains of flu are a regular occurrence - this is not news . \nWe should follow the example of China and quarantine travellers from Mexico until the incubation period for the virus has passed . \nWhat precautions do I take before swine flu reaches our city ? \nSomething which governments have realized over the centuries is that the populace is far easier to control if they are in fear . \nFirst there was the War on Terror and people fearing that fundamentalists were going to destroy their way of life . \nNext came the recession and people being in genuine fear for their jobs and livelihoods . \nNow comes swine flu and people fearing for their lives . \nThe global media has been complicit in scaremongering and overhyping the issues until the problems have become a reality . \nIn an average flu season , many people die and this is no worse . \nAs swine flu has not been shown to be fatal in the UK perhaps we should catch it and get the immunity while it 's not . \nNote : I 'm not a Doctor . \nSpike Milligan was right , illness is good for you . \nNews correspondents and newspapers are making a fortune out of this latest scare story . \nWe should keep a close eye on activities in government while this distraction is in place . \nEmployers these days ` expect ' people to work whilst ill and it is frowned upon and made difficult through rules and legislation to have time off when you are ill . \nHence many of us struggle on whilst contagious . \nUntil attitudes change this will continue and your swine flu will spread quite nicely . \nThe one thing I would like to come out of this is that it should become socially unacceptable for people to go to work whilst ill . \nAlso , people who send their children into school when they have heavy colds and flu should be forced to keep them at home , whether they can be bothered to look after them or not . \nIt would seem , that , we in Britain , with our abundance of drugs dismiss this threat easily . \nMost of us miss the larger picture here however . \nBritain does not produce it 's own food supplies , only a small percentage of it in fact . \nWhile we have our drugs and comfortable existence , how do we expect to fair when we have no food supplies coming anymore ? \nSimply put , we can stop our population being ravished by swine flu , we have drugs against this . \nOur food suppliers , whom we have become dependant do not . \nWhen they all start dying and stop working out of fear , we all start suffering from hunger . \nThis is scenario which governments do not talk about and would prefer not to be addressed . \nShould this become a pandemic ... Gloom and doom . \nWhat will we all die from next ? \nWill there be a new strain of Peruvian common cold ? \nOr will we be told that potatoes are potential killers ? \nOne day , wine is good , next day it 's bad . \nThe `` 5 a day '' will likely be rubbished soon , too . \nLive you lives to the fullest , in moderation , is all I can say . \nIgnore the `` advice '' from the `` Scientists '' . \nThe advice changes daily . \nIt is relatively mild thus far ... in the UK . \nBut are we just to think of ourselves and forget about developing countries who do not have stocks of tamiflu and can not afford to buy it ? \nAfter reading the webpage about how different countries are responding , it is abundantly clear that there is not enough of the antiviral drug stockpiled in many , if not most , of them , should the virus spread like wildfire . \nIf we are blase about the risks and take no precautionary measures , then certainly , our well-stocked country might find it to be no more than a blip in our day-to-day lives . \nBut while we are being blase , we are traveling all over the world , visiting developing countries who are not well-stocked with anti-virals , who could end up in a crisis situation due to their being continually and repeatedly infected by countries who do n't care because they can treat it . \nThere appears to be no need to panic as yet , but we do have an obligation to attempt to contain it , even if we can treat it easily , because other countries ca n't . \nThe usual over reaction caused by a media who will publish anything gloomy . \nFlu has been on the go , in different strains for thousands of years . \nMankind is still alive and kicking . \nI am more worried about the rise in food prices . \nYeah so we have it here just 2 miles down the road . \nThis is totally irresponsible behavior allowing people from flights to enter the country unchecked . \nThey should have quarantined people off flights immediately to monitor them , not let them enter the community to spread disease . \nFor goodness sake we are an Island , wake up . \nNow for the sake of putting those people in quarantine we have a school closed with hundreds of children disrupted , and another person to person infected . \nSo they say that if they have closed flights it would have affected trade etc well if thousands get ill and cant work and even worse die then what will happen to economies . \nAgain there was no reason for this virus to be let loose onto our island . \nAvoid a pandemic by just admitting that it 's not a pandemic ; or else when a real one comes folks will be desensitized . \nFurthermore , I think that the coverage is very insulting to the millions who die every year of real pandemic like malaria . \nHow can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? \nBut it does n't seem too dangerous . \nI would far rather take my chance with it now rather that next winter . \nSo please stop ` protecting ' me . \nAlso if it does mutate into something really nasty I would rather my immune system had been ` primed ' with the current version . \nIt occurs to me that no-one has seriously considered the possibility that the strain of H1N1 that has caused mortality in Mexico is not actually endemic to that region . \nInstead , it is possible that the strain has been introduced to the region from abroad and has impacted the local population disproportionately due to their lack of endemic resistance to the strain . \nThis would be consistent with epidemiological data on reported rates of mortality within and outside Mexico . \nIf this is true , then the pandemic - or international transmission of the virus - has actually been underway for much longer than has been considered and\\/or reported . \nI would be interested to hear back from an expert to refute this hypothesis based on the current evidence that we have . \nThe difference between this flu and the other types of flu which kill thousands is that this one promotes such a strong immune response that healthy young people are now at risk rather than the older\\/compromised patients that your ` average ' flu kills . \nThis is why this strain is getting coverage . \nSo yes people should be more worried about swine flu but as yet it has n't picked up any mutations that could make it a truly deadly threat . \nAre you media people not over this issue yet . \nIt 's a prolonged flu season . \n150 people have died world wide . \nHas anyone done the comparison with a usual flu season and the number of deaths ? \nI am Mexican and have lived in the UK for many years now , after watching and following the news regarding the current events with the swine flu ; I am really disgusted how the scare mongering media has ruined the economy of a country . \nIt is unfortunate that it was Mexico where this virus originated . \nIf it was a `` developed '' country I am sure that the media would adopt more careful balanced reporting . \nCurrently Mexican people arriving in other countries have been abused and treated as lepers . \nDo you think that this is right ? \nPlease stop being so alarming and concentrate on the facts . \nYou are causing more collapse of the world economy and more unemployment in Mexico where people are not nursed by the government like here ! \n` We 've been preparing for a flu epidemic for ages ' they tell us . \nI believe them ; all the different agencies have been working together , doing their bit , but , just as they prepared for terrorist attacks , not one of these agencies or Government thought to consider how to communicate with the public , what duty they owe us . \nIn both cases it was clear it had n't even been thought of , never mind worked out . \nWe are not in the equation , which is n't surprising , given the total contempt those in power have for us , the public , who are just a problem to be negotiated , handled , if we can be bothered to rouse ourselves . \nTruly , we do n't deserve any better , since we 've let them get away with murder , literally , for centuries . \nYou , the media are as bad ; you know better , but still do n't hold them to account You know what would be way more harmful than swine flu ? \nShutting down economies that people depend on for their livelihood . \nCreating global panic and fear . \nI 'm very concerned about this `` shut down the borders '' attitude . \nI 'm sceptical about the swine flu `` pandemic '' in multiple ways . \nSo it might mutate into something a lot more serious ... but for now it 's apparently just like normal flu but a bit nastier . \nBut not necessarily deadly . \nAt the moment , if it 's just flu , it should be fairly easy to get over . \nbut the stress of being told we 're all gonna die is n't helping ... stress makes the body more vulnerable to disease . \nNo one cares about plain old flu , but when it 's swine flu which is just a slightly worse case of flu , global panic . \nIf it gets to the point where we are actually all in serious danger , go crazy . \nBut right now it does n't sound much more than flu . \nLast year 34,000 people in the US died of ` common ' influenza viruses without so much as a byline in the press . \nVaccines have been widely and freely available and still they became infected and died from failure to take the vaccine . \nIt is impossible to stop all cases of common flu let alone new swine flu . \nThe response has been alarmist as if it 's the end of the world . \nMedia driven story frenzy is very much to blame and politicians react to hysterical public pressure . \nThis is not the Black Plague . \nWould n't be too worried about it at the moment , it is a slightly harmful bug at present . \nHowever I do n't understand the people getting complacent about this . \nYes Bird Flu ended up being a scare . \nPeople are forgetting viruses and bugs are in fact extremely clever , and can form defences to anti-viral drugs etc. . \nIf swine flu mutates ... we could be in trouble . \nMark B , London - As an Infection Control Nurse , I am more than capable of explaining to my children , -LRB- who are old enough to understand what is going on - they are not that little -RRB- what is happening , and how to take precautions themselves . \nYes , this virus may only be `` just flu '' but people die of the complications like Pnuemonia . \nThe fact that it has been reported in the news that a school has been closed because a student has contracted the virus , and other children may also have it , has brought it closer to `` their world '' . \nChildren do not normally have full blown flu ! \nWhen I said people were being complacent , I meant that it will be sorry state of affairs when all those who say `` it 's only flu '' find themselves or family members struck down with it . \nFor all those who say its not serious , why worry ? \nWhat about people who are susceptible to flu ? \nMy mother is , she has weakened immunity and -LRB- any -RRB- unvaccinated flu is likely to kill her . \nI am not joking but very , very serious . \nShe lives in self imposed quarantine during the winter and the same now . \nUntil there is a vaccine for this one I wo n't see her until she has had it . \nShe only lives two miles away ! \nIt would be nice if people -LRB- especially the government -RRB- took this more seriously as its clearly not just flu but the pneumonia that can arise from it , that 's the killer . \nPlease stop being so blas about it , what is one mans little bug is another mans killer and a fear we have to live with all of our lives in this family . \nWith Mexico 's epidemic status , a certified self-quarantined program , eg 7 days without symptoms in an enclosed home etc , before international travel will establish a first line of defense . \nThe current heavy handed quarantine-shutting down 1 hotel due to 1 visitor - is obviously unsustainable if you allow 500 visitors -LRB- 1 plane-load -RRB- with flu to come through with no effective checks before boarding . \nAlthough I am not a biologist . \nI Did take enough of the sciences to know that it 's important during any outbreak that the WHO identifies as a risk to take special care to follow their advice . \nWhat will be interesting to see is the relationship between stress on countries like economics , their state of being as far as how developed they are , their cultural histories in how they deal with medical emergencies and how they fair with this particular event . \nThat data should signal to the world how important is it for us to focus more on sharing our subsistence strategies and not on how much money we have or whether or not `` our way '' is `` the way '' . \nPanickers on HYS still cling to their fear - now they 're saying that ` sure it 's mild now but it might mutate ! '' . \nANY virus might mutate . \nSeasonal flu also mutates - 2 years ago it mutated so much that the vaccine from the start of the season was only 50 % effective . \nAnd seasonal flu kills 35,000 people in the US in an average year . \nBut it 's no reason to panic . \nPeter Nelson , Boston MA , USA It firsts starts of as a minor outbreak , this has happened in the past before as well . \nnd before we know it , it will spread rapidly . \nso everyone should be careful in what they touch , especially dirty surfaces -LRB- see the swine flu advert -RRB- . \nIt seems to me there is a mountain being made out of a mole hill by the media . \nIt is sad that so many people have died but so far there are no other deaths . \nThe flu kills every year and this one seems no different . \nHow does that turn into a pandemic ? \nEither the media has latched onto this story and has run with it or there are missing parts to this story . \nEither way , I have stopped listening until there is something new to hear . \nWearing face masks gives a false sense of security . \nIt certainly helps in prevention of spread of the flu but it certainly does not help in contracting the flu from someone who is infected . \nYes , maybe its all hype to most of you . \nBut if you are old , or on immunosuppressants , or a transplant patient , or pregnant , or have a chronic chest , or have HIV , this is a pretty big deal . \nAre any such people allowed to even have Tamiflu at home so they can take it right away if they get ill ? \nNor can they buy it online as our wonderful government will even stop you saving yourself . \nMeanwhile corporate Britain can buy tons of it to dose up perfectly fit people . \nThis is ` flu , a mutation as all ` flu viruses are . \nWhy is this being blown up into such a crisis . \nEven if you catch this particular ` flu , just use common sense although that seems to have one out of the window . \nStay in bed , drink plenty of fluids and you will recover . \nDo not waste health professionals time if you sneeze just the once ! \nYou should check your facts . \nThe swine flu information line is an 0800 number , therefore a free number . \nNHS direct is a 08454 number 5 pence per minute . \nHow can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? \nBy NOT creating it with an influx of media and global hype . \nPeople who sneeze , cough and get the chills will `` think '' they 've got it . \nStupid media strikes at the heart of our minds once again . \nFor the people who complain it is all being ` overblown ' by the media . \nYou are partly right . \nThere is an over abundance of coverage on this issue . \nHowever , If the ` swine flu ' mutates into a form that is anywhere near the virulence of the ` Spanish Flu ' from 1918-1920 we could be looking at millions of deaths worldwide . \nI think a 7 day period of ` over caution ' in order to avoid even a slight risk of millions of death is worthwhile . \nHow to spread diseases ? \nPack a couple of hundred people in a ` plane with constant recirculation of the same old stale air for a few hours and let one infected person sneeze . \nHow to prevent this happening ? \nPut a stop to all unnecessary flights . \nAlex the Hat , Cardiff , UK I can not believe the fear and anxiety being whipped up and perpetuated by the media about this flu . \nIt 's flu not bubonic plague . \nThe poor people in Mexico who died did not have our standard of living nor our health care . \nOf a population of over 60 million and only 9 confirmed cases , this is overkill taken to the extreme . \nThere is very little news here . \nOf course it may serve a discredited government to have the population in fear to keep them in line and to divert attention from their many failures . \nExcuse me but has everyone forgotten how many millions of people in Africa and Asia die every year from MALARIA ? \nOh sorry they live in the 3rd world and do n't have broadband\\/satnav\\/lcd tv\\/ipods so they do n't matter do they ? \nWake up people to the rubbish you are being fed by your governments every day of your lives to keep you in check . \nBy promoting good hygiene but it 's mostly down to luck now ! \nAlan Shirley , Kingston upon Thames The Mexican pig-flu is giving our health systems the MOT , and those countries with a poor public health system are exposed . \nReading through the comments , i have noticed so many people trying to think this is another media hype . \nHonestly do you think that all those government officials , scientists , WHO officials and many other people are stupid ? \nThe WHO pandemic phase 5 was declared after great consideration into the matter . \nWell some say more people die of other diseases , but why ? \nEver thought about it ? \nBecause those diseases spread out fast , and became hard to control whenever they started . \nIf we do the same , i.e. ignore the current flu problem , then one more deadly virus will be out and about , killing even more people . \nI think that the press are making this sound bigger than it actually is as hundreds of people die every year in Mexico from normal flu . \nHow do we know that these people have not all died from normal flu , and only a few from swine flu ? \n`` Swine flu appears to be as mild an illness as the regular flu . \nYuri '' Had it ever occurred to you that WHO scientists are aware of something that you do n't know about ? \nWhat virologists know -LRB- but the public is blissfully ignorant of -RRB- is that flu viruses can easily mutate . \nThat 's how viruses survive . \nA global flu pandemic can easily last a year . \nWhat scientists are concerned about is that what started out as a comparatively mild strain of flu can suddenly mutate into a strain that 's highly virulent and deadly . \nThere can be a ` second wave ' of a pandemic that 's much more destructive than the first . \nI wish we could have a five day siesta like the Mexicans . \nWe have 5 probable cases of the flu in Wisconsin too . \nWhy ca n't we have five days off work ? \nThis whole event is totally silly . \nI have sympathy for those very few people who have lost loved ones but the hysteria is ridiculous . \nIf this is what happens when a different and mild flu strain comes along what will happen when a real crisis happens ? \nThere are fewer people who walk through the streets not wearing masks to protect themselves after the announcement made by the Hong Kong government that the first confirmed case has occurred . \nI have no idea why Hongkongers ignore the alert as this deadly flu has just reached our place . \nWe should be fine if we neglect reading the media . \nThey get us all confused . \nYou ca n't avoid a pandemic . \nThe world is a lot smaller nowadays and people travel across the globe 24\\/7 . \nThis is just life in modern age . \nThe point is not how serious this illness is now but how serious a form it will become . \nWhile I obviously denounce any panic at any stage in this outbreak , anyone with medical expertise would agree with the WHO that this situation needs to be closely monitored and people kept informed , although sweeping tabloid headlines are not the way to do this . \nThere should be a program whereby key workers can volunteer to be exposed to the virus now so that when the epidemic really hits in the autumn , there will be people who can keep things going when the rest are laid up in bed . \nI ca n't believe that the NHS phone number for help on swine flu is a premium number !! I 've been making the very same comment myself re why not stop the flights in and out till the storm has passed over is this not logic ? \nStrict hygienic measures were taken to effectively control cholera in Peru in 1991 after demonising , mistakenly , fish . \nNow the Peruvian 's ordeal seems to be repeating in Mexico , but this time it 's not fish , it 's pigs instead . \nAdded to the virtual panic over economic problems in the capitalist world , this flu and the hype accompanying it makes it easy for people leap into the news media-generated abyss . \nPart of the problem has been US government 's misinformation and nearly hourly change-of-mind announcements . \nThe US Centre for Disease Control has been a monument to confusion since the flu first began , which only adds to many people 's hysteria . \nSo many comments , so much ignorance . \nSpanish flu was mild early in its spring appearance , devastating in the fall - when it killed `` just '' one or two percent of the infected in North America . \nThe virus has n't fully adapted to humans yet , we have no idea what 's to come . \nYes it 's true , this cloud will probably pass , but it still pays to come in out of the rain . \nAs for official medical ignorance - we discovered this year that Vitamin D is also a hormone that down regulates the immune system , so young people at risk ought to be advised to take it to prevent cytokine storm . \nStudies after SARS proved that N95 masks were VERY effective in preventing infection , contrary to what had been thought -LRB- and is still often said . -RRB- \nThey are very cheap -LRB- for industrialized nations -RRB- , and should be in every first aid kit . \nJoe Thorpe , New York , USA I 'm scared of swine flu , I hope it does n't affect us . \nLets hope the engineers can make the perfect cure . \nEverything is pretty controlled here , pretty calm . \nWe have not had a single case , the population is tranquil even despite the massive fear that the media world is causing . \nYes it is true it can be contagious , but give us a break . \nHundreds of thousand of people get infected by regular flu every day and no one ever paid attention to it . \nThe economical damage that the media is provoking to these country is enormous because of the fear they have created , I lost my job and so have thousands . \nI live in a city that can be an easy target , I do n't have it , my friends and family do n't have it and the friends of my friends they dot not have it either . \nI ca n't see what all the worry is about . \nVery few have died , much less than in a regular flu season . \nIt seems like a lot of hype to me . \nAccording to the BBC website we have 484 confirmed cases from a world population of 6.8 billion . \nAm I alone in thinking this is all an unnecessary panic generated by the media ? \nIn a way it is a good thing this came along , as now no one appears to be worrying about the global economy . \nTrev The Sparky , Newcastle , UK My advice would be to catch this flu early while the NHS is offering red carpet treatment . \nUnpleasant and risky it may be but at least you will not be in a queue for treatment . \nWhat concerns me is that , as Jack commented , the 1918 flu was deadliest for those people with the most effective immune systems - young healthy people - and this swine flu is likely to be the same . \nMexican borders should be closed until this situation calms down . \nAnyone who even considers going on holiday to Mexico in the near future is obviously not too bright and needs to be saved from themselves . \nExtreme poverty kills more than swine flu might do every year , yet we see none of the media hype about that . \nEven in wealthy Britain the old can die from lack of enough heat or food . \nPerhaps it 's the fact that flu takes no account of wealth that has got everyone so excited . \nAfter all , the rich might die too ! \nDo what your mother told you : Cover your mouth when you sneeze , stay home in bed when sick , do n't spit or snot , wash your hands and keep your distance out of others ' personal space . \nAs for the rest of it ? \nIt is all complete hysterical tosh including flu jabs and face masks . \nIt 's just the flu with a different name !! Dave B -LRB- Brit ex-pat -RRB- , Uxbridge , Canada Keep healthy , stop tiring yourself and doing dangerous life threatening sports . \nOur immune system is more about our everyday health , so keeping well , or not getting flu , is about being able to fight these viruses off . \nUnfortunately our cleaning and so called health industry have got their sticky fingers into the here and now , rather than prevention . \nSo far this virus is behaving exactly like regular flu , killing only the very vulnerable and those living in poor conditions . \nThis is not big news , people . \nSomeone who said that it would be a good idea to have alcohol hand-gels like Purrell for home school and bus are talking foolishness . \nPurrell does kill 99.9 percent of germs , but the other .1 percent are resistant to the alcohol , so they mutate and reproduce , creating viruses that are completely immune to it . \nWarm water and soap is enough !! Why do you keep on about this swine flu ? \nMore people die every winter from regular flu . \nStop scaremongering and report some real news . \nSwine flu appears to be as mild an illness as the regular flu . \nMore and more cases are coming from Mexico , common sense would dictate that if you stop the flights from Mexico , you therefore minimize the number of new cases entering the country . \nTherefore why are we being told by the EU Health Ministers that there is no point in a travel ban . \nFor example , when we had foot and mouth in UK , there was a worldwide ban on imports of meat from UK to many countries . \nTherefore it is common sense to stop arrivals from Mexico to stop the spread of swine flu . \nWhatever happened to common sense ? \nThis sort of news is exactly what keeps us alive : Drama and Chaos in an otherwise dull day in the US suburbia ! \n`` The BBC is now spreading misinformation . \nIt is no longer called the swine flu - please correct your stories lest more people think it can be spread through pigs or eating pork . \nAlex , Boston , USA '' While pork products are safe pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses . \nGed , St Pete , Florida , USA One way to avoid the pandemic is not to believe all that our hysterical media are pumping out . \nEvery illness is some tragedy , and 168 deaths that may be related to H1N1 are serious , but many more people die from obesity every month . \nHave n't you guys got something better to write about ? \nWhat about a sense of proportion for a change ? \nAndrew Dundas , Ilkley , UK & Florida In the past when there was no cure for TB , smallpox or other such killer diseases people would be in severe panic when any of those broke out , but now they take such diseases very slightly because they know there are dependable preventive and curative treatments . \nI wonder , why are we not yet succeeding to find preventive and curative treatment against ` bird flu ' or now ` swine flu ' ? \nMen have conquered land after land and some space planets too as well as lots of inventions and discoveries . \nWhy do they not care to conquer these killer diseases ? \nThe only ways of avoiding swine flu for now is to reduce family outings . \nGovernments should make sure that all those places which are congested such as schools , cinema halls and others are closed until this deadly flu is contained . \nUse common sense , wash hands frequently . \nRemember , in most cases the flu is mild and self-limited . \nDo not panic after listening to excessive and sensational media coverage . \nWe need to stop the media-induced mass hysteria and get on with our lives . \nI think I might be worried if I lived in Mexico but , frankly , I 'm unconcerned here . \nThere are far too many deaths each day from other causes , and if my number 's up , then so be it . \nThe BBC is now spreading misinformation . \nIt is no longer called the swine flu - please correct your stories lest more people think it can be spread through pigs or eating pork . \nWe have experience SARS and seen the horror . \nBut it was contain only in Asia . \nBut ` swine flu ' will most surely be global and this only that we are all one irrespective of countries or race . \nLets us all be united . \nSome of the comments on here are laughable : Jo from Berkshire ... no wonder your kids are scared if you 're incapable of speaking sense to them . \nNo one has died in the UK from it , yet we 're all being complacent ? \nWe do n't know much about it , but it could be the next pandemic ? \nPlease , for the sake of your children , turn off the TV and worry about something else . \nThis is a media storm purely for the benefit of the media . \nUp to 0.5 m people die a year from normal flu . \nAre your children worried that they might die from that too , as it seems far more likely ? \nOr do you just scare them with what they papers tell you to scare them with ? \nOur citizens are being told not to make physical contact with anyone in public . \nAs an `` air kiss '' on the cheek or an handshake is the normal greeting , it is causing stress at a cultural level . \nPatricia Stenlund , San Ramon , Costa Rica Why are plane loads of passengers coming from Mexico having sat in a confined space together for several hours being allowed to disembark and come into direct contact with hundreds of people . \nWould some form of quarantine and monitoring not reduce the chances of the virus spreading through our communities . \nWhere is the common sense approach . \nFact outside of Mexico 1 person has died out of 150 + cases a mortality rate of less than 1 % Fact in Mexico there is no clear idea who has died of swine flu and how many cases , there are 7 confirmed deaths . \nNVCJD was going to kill millions . \nSpanish flu came after WW1conditions were perfect for it to spread thousands of soldiers coming home in mass transports poor health systems in ravaged economies . \nLet 's try and keep a sense of proportion . \nIn the school days I knew about Flu and Dengue fevers . \nThen recently we came to know about SARS and bird flu . \nNow swine flu is alarmingly scaring all mainly by the media reportage from USA , Europe , etc. though it has started from Mexico . \nPrecautionary measures should be popularized to avert in other parts of the world . \nIf public hygiene is maintained this can not happen again . \nPollution is the main problem that causes all crises along with diseases as this pandemic one ! \nClean world is the best solution and panacea for healthy life for all ! \nT A Ramesh , Pondicherry , India Media fear mongering , end of story . \nRegards , vast majority of people -LRB- thanks for reflecting our views -RRB- If the government warns us , and if the media warns us , then they are over reacting , if both the Government and the media fail to keep us updated , then they are incompetent , Makes you think ? \nLook , we need alcohol gel hand wash in school and for home , everywhere , really . \nOh and we should have them on buses Why do n't the governments of the world do what Mexico do and shut the country down , sure it will have an economic impact but is n't saving lives more important . \nThis virus has the potential to mutate again and become more dangerous so governments around the world need to act now or face losing lives . \nWhy do they not put their emergency plans in action now , before it is too late ? \nHas anybody noticed that the majority of deaths have been in Mexico , who , let 's face it , has a poor health system ? \nMuch like Bird Flu , where the majority of deaths were within communities where those who died either spent their lives around birds or were close to those who did . \nKeep clean , keep alert , but do n't panic . \nThat 's my advice . \nWhy is this any more dangerous than any other form of flu ? \nNew versions of the flu virus continue to evolve . \nFlu can be fatal so what 's special about this one ? \nAbout ten people died yesterday on the roads , why is the money not available to control this ongoing waste of life ? \nWhy panic over something that happens every year ? \nflu kills hundreds of people in this country every year ! \nIf you are worried , take a low dosage vitamin C supplement . \nIt wo n't stop you from catching the Flu , but you will recover from it quicker and have it milder than every one else . \nWhile i believe that the mass hysteria is largely misplaced , it has in its own way helping to keep a serious pandemic at bay - people are aware now and are going out of their way to keep good hygiene and watch for symptoms . \nFrom the information at hand I 'm of the opinion that we are just going to see something similar to a ` nasty outbreak ' of winter flu - Genuinely unpleasant and not without casualties but certainly not Armageddon . \nWhat a joke ... media are whipping up a stupid and gormless public ... get a life and get back to work At the moment I 'm not that worried swine flu . \nSo far the vast majority of people that have contracted it have only had mild symptoms . \nAs with any flu virus some people suffer worse then others , and deaths as a result of flu is not unheard of . \nI do n't see that point of people wearing masks and rubber gloves , as it really is n't going to provide you with any real protection . \nLet 's get those bins back in the underground so tissues can be binned instead of left on seats , which is what happens . \nAlso food outlets should provide hand washing facilities rather than insist that you buy food \\* before \\* using their toilets . \nWith a world population of almost seven billion , thirteen confirmed deaths ? \nWhy so much panic ? \nUndoubtedly more people have died from regular flu this year . \nPractice proper hygiene , avoid crowded placed , but do n't panic . \nThis will be contained in the near future . \nSo far I have not read or heard ANYTHING to justify the mass hysteria being whipped up by the media - we 're now being told this is just a normal , every day flu bug , so why is the WHO whipping it up with ` pandemic ' alerts and people talking about travel bans and ` shutting down ' services ? \nI 've got a holiday booked in Mexico in July and I 'm not going to let the threat of a bout of flu ruin it . \nThe way to avoid a pandemic which is created by a virus that is not capable of jumping continents is to stop people from traveling . \nIt 's simple , less migration , less impact by viruses such as swine flu . \nOh and I saw a rather apt cartoon in one of the free papers on the train the other day , it 's caption was along the lines of `` and over to our health correspondent , who will make things sound 10 times worse than they really are '' ... Raven Morpheus , Braintree , Essex , UK Sounding the warning is a good preventive approach . \nHowever , over sounding it could have detrimental effects . \nIf people are dissuaded from going about their regular businesses , obviously the economy would be harmed . \nMasks and gloves are a bit too much of a precautionary measure at this time as it may generate pandemonium . \nSimple hygiene procedures : washing ones hands regularly , covering mouth when coughing etc , should be encouraged . \nBut most importantly paying proper attention to what , where and how one eats\\/drinks should be top priority . \nIn cases were symptoms are clear , medical attention should be sought immediately . \nThis virus is worrying . \nWe have no way of knowing whether it will escalate into a more severe flu or not . \nMy children are terrified that they may contract it and die from it , even though , so far no one in the UK has died from it . \nToo many people are being too complacent about it . \nYes , we have had scares in the past with SARS and Bird Flu , but this one may be the pandemic scientist have been worried about ! \nIt is a virus that wo n't distinguish between race , religion , age , sex or dietary preferences ! \nDaniel , Philadelphia , PA , USA If one good thing comes out of this situation , it will be educating those who do not cover their mouths\\/noses when sneezing\\/coughing . \n`` When all 's said and done , it 's merely flu . \nI 'd be worried if it were a serious illness , but flu ? \n`` Megan , Cheshire , UK `` Merely '' flu ? \nInfluenza is and has always been a killer among vulnerable groups . \nThe reason most do n't understand this is because so many people confuse flu with a bad cold or have only been mildly affected . \nIf you 've ever had a serious dose of flu you 'll know the difference . \nI do n't want to play into the mass hysteria here , but I think to say that flu is not a serious illness is the sort of comment that only comes from people who have never had it . \nReal flu is not a bad cold with aches and mild pain , I have had real flu and I did n't know if I was going to make it . \nALL kinds of flu are dangerous , respect that and follow good hygiene procedures . \nI think if you have had contact with anyone who has it , or is suspected of having it , stay home until the incubation time has passed as by the time the symptoms are showing you have already passed it on . \nDumbest thing I 've heard yet . \n`` If you have a cold you ca n't get the flu .

Swine flu is a cause of concern to the world . \nHuman Life value is much more important than any thing else on the planet earth . \nMexico has a big challenge on hand . \nThey need to fight this swine Flu with minimum damage to human race and come out as a winner as early as possible . \nGod and world will help them in this mission . \nMe and my countries prayers and good wishes are with them and rest of the world where ever this Swine Flu has spread . \nI think it 's already too late ... we 're doomed ! \nIn case anyone 's interested I 've built a bunker from old copies of the Daily Express and Government leaflets on how to avoid the flu ... why not come and join me ! \nSorry , no pigs aloud . \nYou ca n't avoid it . \nYou might as well say how cab we hold back the sea with an egg cup ! \nYou ca n't avoid other people and each person carries germs . \nPerhaps now , communication over the Broadband network will come into it 's own with people working from home . \nThis will not prevent an epidemic but will at least cut down on the amount of germs moving about . \nStephen Robertson , Dinnington , South Yorks I live in Scotland just three miles from Airdrie and I 'm not that worried about it as long as you keep good personal hygiene you should be fine and watch what you touch Railings in shopping centres desks people etc. . . \nI think we will have it under control soon I just hope that the death toll does not go up I hope I have helped . \nThis is an excuse for martial law . \nIt is made by the US government , tailored to their needs . \nA worse one is coming , mark my words . \nWhatever does n't kill us makes us stronger . \nI 'm looking forward to being stronger . \nBy not talking about it so much - is the media crying wolf ? \nThese types of flu come and go quite quite quickly - so the best way to control it is probably the Mexican way - stay at home for five days . \nAlso , if this flu is like the 1918 flu , it was those with the most effective immune systems that died -LRB- by suffocating from the excessive mucus in the lungs -RRB- . \nIt is only flu . \nwe get this every year in the UK and people die from it . \nI fail to see what all the fuss is about . \nIn the last 10 years I have lived in six countries which means extreme climate changes , water , food , bacteria and germs . \nI also spend six months attending to someone who was terminally ill - in hospitals and hospices daily ; yet more germs . \nI caught one snuffle and one cold during that period . \nI rarely get sick . \nUntil this past Christmas when I caught a flu I am still recovering from , four months later . \nI was unable to last much longer than two hours at a time for the first two months . \nPrelude to swine fu ? \nWhatever this is , do not dismiss or disregard it . \nIt 's not an average flu bug . \nIf I had a weaker constitution I suspect I might be dead by now . \nI think everyone should take a leaf out Mexico 's book and shut down and stay at home at least then there be a less of a chance of spreading the infections to people Let nature take its own course . \nIf this virus originated in Africa , no body would have noticed . \nThis is a rich man 's hysteria because Mexico is a one of the rich man 's major destination . \nDeadly opportunistic virus like ebola come and go and that how nature operates . \nThis virus was there and will be but now it got the conditions right to mushroom and with time will return to its normal state . \nWhat really concerns me is the fact that large pharmaceutical companies can greatly benefit from Pandemics , boosting product sales by a considerable amount . \nSurely much tighter restrictions\\/regulations should be put into place in a pandemic\\/epidemic situation . \nWe have all seen what greed and lack of regulation can do to an industry and the negative impact on humanity . \nWe can not allow the same to happen within the pharmaceutical industry . \nI 'm more worried about the pandemic stupidity which appears to have broken out over this issue . \nYou are more at risk of dying in a car accident this weekend that of getting swine flu let alone dying of it but is anyone suggesting not getting into a car ? \nWould n't staying in Mexico be much safer than herding any more waiting travellers together into aluminium tubes , to infect each other as they fly half way round the world . \nOr is mass infection just inevitable and best get it over with -LRB- and cultivate the antibodies -RRB- sooner rather than later ? \nI plan to do nothing and hope the media finds a different story to sensationalise soon . \nThe BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published . \nYour comments may be published on any BBC media worldwide . \n"}

'' \nI remind him that the country 's partial shutdown of the economy does not include supermarkets . \n`` But we do n't want to go out , it might be risky , '' he says . \nA little over a week ago , this global health crisis was triggered when the Mexican government announced that it had detected a new strain of flu virus , and was closing all schools . \nIt informed the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- that it suspected 60 people had already been killed by what soon became known as swine flu . \nSo many deaths , after apparently a very short time , worried the Mexican authorities . \n`` We were spooked , '' one government official admitted to me . \n`` People seemed to be dying , and we did n't know why . '' \nIt takes several days for tests for swine flu infection to be verified But when those first figures were released , the word `` suspected '' was crucial . \nMexico was not certain at that stage that 60 people had been killed by swine flu . \nAnd it still does not know . \nIt takes several days for tests to be properly verified . \nThe current , confirmed , death toll stands at 16 . \nInitial data indicates that apparent mortality rate is comparable to that of seasonal flu . \nIn the grandiose health ministry building in central Mexico City , I sat down with the country 's Health Minister , Jose Angel Cordova . \nAs a nod to the enduring risk of infection , he prefers not to shake hands these days , instead offering the sleeve of his perfectly cut suit . \nI asked him whether he thought that his government had initially over-estimated the deadliness of the virus . \n`` Maybe , yes , '' he said . \nBut he stressed that his experts were dealing with so many unknowns at that stage . \nWhat they did know was that the virus was potentially virulent and potentially deadly . \nHumans had no natural resistance to it . \nAs they tried to work out who was dying of what and why , it is worth remembering some complicating facts , which are peculiar to Mexico . \nYou can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia Most of the suspected fatalities were , and still are , in the capital , Mexico City . \nThe city is at an elevation of 2,300 m -LRB- 7,540 ft -RRB- . \nIt is home to almost 23 million people . \nMost days , a thick polluted smog can be seen hanging over the vast metropolis . \nEvery year , swine flu or not , over half a million cases of respiratory problems are reported in the city . \n`` You can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia , '' says Dr Franciso Moreno , an expert in infectious diseases at the ABC medical center in Mexico City . \n`` About 90 % of the patients who have come to the hospital in the last few days have mild respiratory problems , from other causes . '' \nThe deluge of suspected cases has made it extremely difficult to tell who has swine flu , and who does not . \nH1N1 has had consequences which few would have ever predicted . \nSomething which possibly began in rural communities in Mexico has led to the quarantine of a luxury hotel in Hong Kong , and the slaughter of all the pigs in Egypt . \nAnd has this all been a global false alarm ? \nThe Mexican health minister says it is still too early to say . \nHe says that the threat of new viruses should not be under-estimated . \nAs he spends the bank holiday weekend watching TV with his family , Pedro Aparicio says he thinks that the government did exactly the right thing . \n`` You ca n't be too careful , '' he says . \n"}

{"id": "113", "time": "2009-05-05", "text": "Mark Easton | 16:59 UK time , Tuesday , 5 May 2009 `` Hey , let 's be careful out there ! '' \nThe homely advice from Sergeant Phil Esterhaus to his officers on TV 's Hill Street Blues came to mind reading the government 's leaflet on swine flu `` Always carry tissues , '' advises the NHS . \n`` Wash your hands with soap and hot water . '' \nNow , the leaflet looks to be a sensible document which may have its place in clearing some of the fog of anxiety which shrouds the swine flu outbreak . \nBut I wonder whether there is also a danger that it risks infantilising the populace . \nAs my mother used to call after me : `` Have you got a nice clean hankie ? '' \nOn a train the other day , the announcer told us : `` Do take care when leaving the train '' . \nThere is part of me that immediately wants to exit the train in a `` care-free '' manner . \nSprinkling marbles on the ground as I go . \nI know , I know ! \nThis is a highly irresponsible attitude and I could easily do myself and others a mischief . \nBut there is a patronising tone to such warnings , the suggestion that if they had n't reminded me of the need for caution as I manoeuvred down the carriage steps , I might well have strapped on roller skates and attempted a triple-flip double-toe double loop on departure . \nWe are constantly being exhorted to `` wrap up warm '' or `` mind our heads '' . \nI saw a big painted sign on a piece of machinery the other day that said , if I recall correctly , `` finger trapping hazard '' . \nThe first sign of frost and someone will pop up to remind us that ice can be slippy and we should be careful when walking along . \nThe weather warms up and there is a well-meaning reminder that sunburn can be a bit of a problem . \nIt 's the same story on aeroplanes . \n`` Do take care when opening the overhead locker '' . \nI am sure there are people who have thrown one open without a second thought and suffered concussion after an unexpected meeting with a heavy overnight case . \nBut it appears I am not alone in having to suppress a rebellious and irresponsible response . \nMichael Bywater , who wrote the excellent book Big Babies on just this phenomenon , remembers the moment he became aware he was being treated like a toddler - and inevitably then wanted to behave like one . \n`` Walking from the aeroplane to baggage reclaim , I idly started to notice the notices . \nThere were , I soon realized , almost a hundred of the things -LRB- not counting advertisements -RRB- between jetway and carousel , all admonishing , warning , ticking me off for something I had n't done , had no intention of doing , had n't even thought of doing until I saw the notice . \nVoices shouted at me about the moving walkway ; bleepers bleeped ; lights flashed ; strange obsessions took root . \nHaving been forbidden to do so , I found myself yearning terribly to take photographs in the customs hall . \nI wanted to find a child , specifically so that I could allow it to ride on my baggage trolley . \nBut most of all I realized that I was being treated like a big baby ; and not just there , but everywhere . '' \nThe `` duty of care '' that organizations have to their clients and customers has been translated into endless bits of homespun counsel . \nI am sure there are lawyers who advise firms that it makes perfect sense to put the warning `` this product may contain nuts '' ... on a packet of nuts . \nThe trouble is that we come to expect authority to tell us how to be careful . \nAnd if we are foolhardy , we then blame `` them '' rather than ourselves . \nWe must all learn how to assess risk . \nHow to adjust our behavior to avoid significant threats . \nWhen it is safe to cross the road . \nBut we have proved ourselves pretty poor at judging the chances that something bad will happen and increasingly rely on others to judge risk for us . \nSo , elderly people may lead less fulfilling lives because they are encouraged to overestimate the risk from violent crime . \nChildren are bred in captivity because parents read so much about the -LRB- very low -RRB- risk from sexual predators . \nNo-one in authority wants to be open to the charge that they did n't take enough care . \nBut few worry about the charge that they did n't take enough risks . \nWithout risk , life is just existence . \nThey say `` you ca n't be too careful '' . \nBut I worry that you can . \nAt 5:49 pm on 05 May 2009 , GiniaHickley wrote : I like it when you get hot drinks from fast food outlets which say `` Caution . \nContains hot drink '' . \nThey 're always luke warm . \nBut my favorite sign is on the tube escalators : `` Dogs must be carried '' . \nI do n't have a dog . \nWill my handbag do ? \nAt 5:56 pm on 05 May 2009 , stanilic wrote : It all stems from a fear of litigation and the litigious . \nIt also is the fault of the bureaucrats who need to keep looking for something to do even if it is just putting up a sign . \nHowever the biggest danger in just about everything is to assume it is safe . \nThings always go wrong when you are not paying attention to what you are doing . \nAt 6:00 pm on 05 May 2009 , RiotInAGraveyard wrote : There are a ridiculous number of notices and warnings . \nAt work , I find myself bombarded with numerous patronising health and safety warnings . \nThe worry is that we surely risk stifling the very creativity and innovation that drives society forward if we try and control every little thing . \nBy micro-managing such everyday , banal , risks , do we not also create a climate of compensation ? \nMany people now expect there to be some sort of governmental safety net for every risk to which they are exposed -LRB- or , in many cases , every risk for which they choose to expose themselves -RRB- . \nWhat happened to learning from your mistakes ? \nAt 6:14 pm on 05 May 2009 , balhamomnibus wrote : Spot on Mark . \nThose gving the directions seem to have no sense of irony . \nI too saw the ` finger trapping hazard ' sign - placed next to the door on a very high tech ambulance . \nAnd while boarding an aircraft on a recent skiing holiday I was told that I could n't take my luke-warm coffee onto the plane for fear I might spill it on another passeger - 90 % of whom were also off to participate in the wreckless sport of skiing . \nStrikes me as a small flash in a very large pan , why must a virus always become deadly wishfull thinking maybe . \nWe all know they evolve and in doing so some become nothing more than a sniffle after starting out deadly . \nStill I suppose the world needs somthing to to fear . \nhow many different virus will tamiflu kill ? \nAt 6:20 pm on 05 May 2009 , Ikarus wrote : It 's a depressing thing , really . \nWorking in a communication role within a large organization , I have found myself having to alert people to please not leave their laptops unattended , as they might get nicked . \nI have been told to warn people of the dangers of tobogganing in the snow . \nI tried to say no to all of them . \nI was overruled in each instance . \nBecause there is no visible cost to being too patronising . \nBut there is a small risk of a large cost if the organization does not show evidence of being proactively caring . \nSmall risk times large cost equals small cost . \nNo cost vs small cost ... the battle is lost before I open my mouth to object . \nNot many but enough to count . \nAt 6:26 pm on 05 May 2009 , nolemonade wrote : Your mention of the train announcer reminded me of arriving at Plymouth station to the announcement : `` Please make sure you take all of your personal problems with you when leaving the train '' . \nDoes the `` personal problems '' bit include fallout from the blocked toilets in the carriages ? \nGood job I traveled by train , though , as washing hands with soap and hot water would be a novelty in Plymouth 's Bretonside Bus Station . \nNo soap has graced the place for years and cold water is sometimes available . \nAbout the same availability as downtown Basra , that is . \nNever mind , the lock the toilets up nice and secure at 6 p.m. sharp , so that 's all right then ...
